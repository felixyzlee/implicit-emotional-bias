0,ek759w,"AITA for cutting off a friend for making me uncomfortable? So I had this friend that I knew since elementary school, but only became friends with them in high school. We were kind of close, and I enjoyed his company for the most part. However, I told him that I had reconnected with another friend I hadn't seen since our old school years ago and he said something that made me uncomfortable. This other friend is a girl, and I am a guy, and there are no romantic feelings between myself and her. The friend in question here, when told about her, said ""I ship you two."" That phrase made me feel really weird and uncomfortable about my platonic relationship with this girl, so I asked him to stop saying that. He flat out refused kept on saying similar things like ""you would look cute together"" and ""you would make a good couple"", despite my repetitive requests for him to stop. Eventually, he said ""if you don't like it, then do something about it."" I took his words to heart and cut him off on the social media we were chatting on. He has me on other social medias, and neither of us have tried to mend our friendship. AITA?"
1,cfdf5m,"AITA for not going to the beach for the weekend for my niece's birthday with my sister and nephew? She has paid for it already... I moved to Georgia with my sister in the beginning of the year and since I got here we have planned to go to the beach for a day, Saturday for her daughter's birthday. The plan was one easy day us sisters and her kids, the beach there and then home. Today I went to work, excitedly thinking about the beach and how we would have fun tomorrow and then come home, we would all get to sleep long since the kids would be tired from the beach tomorrow night and then the next day would be an easy relax day before going back to work. My sister even told me yesterday she was excited for 1 day of beach. Then today she texts me while I'm at work that she wants to spend the night there since it's a 3 hour drive. She has already booked the hotel. It may not seem like a big deal but I just worked 4 days straight 10 hours per day and I dont want to sleep in the same room as my niece (3) and nephew (5) who have night terrors especially when they scream most of the time when we are driving and fight over my sisters phone and all kinds of nonsense. I told my sister, no it's cool, I will just stay here and watch the dog. It's okay. Take note that before this i did offer to take my car, she could drive us there and I'd drive us back and that was when she said no and she already paid for the room... she told me after she told me this if I didnt want to go anymore it would be okay and she would understand but after I said no she got pissed and is now very mad at me. AITA here? 

Tl;dr months in advance plan to go to the beach tomorrow, sister changed last second to a 2 day plan, I dont want to go anymore, AITA?"
2,d3cw5a,"AITA for calling my boyfriends sister a racist in front of her family I (19F) live with my boyfriend (24M). His sister is 21. His mum and sister just came back from a week holiday. Privileged isn’t even the word. She does not pay rent. Pretty sure she doesn’t pay anything at all. I’m pretty sure their holiday was unknowingly paid for by my SO’s dad.  

We’re talking in the kitchen about their holiday. My SIL turns to my SO and says “hey X, why do you think of my little black friend!?’. She then showed us a photo of her with her ‘black friend’. My SO and I looked at each other quite confused as to why she is referring to him as her ‘little black friend’. My SO then says “that’s actually... pretty racist”. She starts getting defensive like “I’m not racist!! I have black friends”. So I *jokingly* said “yeah, that’s what a racist WOULD say!” And she literally started shouting at us saying we were ‘mugging’ her off. 

My MIL later came into my SO and I’s room and said we shouldn’t have embarrassed her and we’re... you guessed it, assholes. Apparently we are snowflakes and ‘can’t take a joke’ 

AITA for ‘pushing’ her buttons"
3,co73hn,"AITA because I hope that my grandmother dies? I (30m) have been caring for my 92 year old grandmother for 5 years.  I don't have her POA, and the rest of the family has fought my efforts to get her in to a care facility.  

She's totally insane.  She can't remember anything short term, goes from manic to totally depressed back to back to back rapidly, fakes illness, hides and throws away her medication, believes the state is out to get her,  and demands to be taken to the doctor 3+ times a week when she isn't sick.

She's actively tried to ruin every relationship I've had for 4 years.  She kept screaming at my last girlfriend about he she's some ""chink bitch.""  She tries to sabotage every business opportunity I've had, including faking a medical emergency and calling 911 to get me to not take a flight to go meet with a company that was interested in my work cause it meant I'd be gone for three days.  

Having to care for her and do my own stuff has me essentially working 80+ hours a week.  I don't have time to clean my house, or really do anything I need to aside from basics to survive.

I have begged the family for assistance on this for months and they refuse to do anything, so I said I may have to find another method to get her in a care facility.  They didn't like that, so my cousin anonymously accused me of stealing her medication to adult protective services. 

I hired a home care group to have a caregiver there every day.  She accused them of stealing from her, abused them mercilessly, and then had my uncle call and fire them without consulting me.  

I can't take it anymore, and I've stopped responding to any emergency she claims with any reasonable speed.  I keep hoping I'll get there and she'll be dead.  I feel like she's stolen very important years from me and no one will help me.  I don't think I'll be free until she's dead. 

My family keeps treating me like I'm some ungrateful entitled shit.  Yes, sh did a lot for me growing up but I've been going out and doing things for her since I was 14.  I've been the only family member of her 30 descendants doing anything for her for over 5 years now.  I want a life.  Am I the asshole here?"
4,dam0by,"AITA for telling my boyfriend’s friend not to get involved in our relationship? Long story short, I (22f) went to a friends house for a party after work last week. My bf and I both work in bars so we work pretty late. At 1am I texted him I was at the party and he sent back a thumbs up. I had intended on getting a taxi home that night as the hostess had said there’d be people there going in the same direction as me. However, this turned out not to be the case. At 4am I texted my boyfriend not to expect me home that night as I was working the next day, a taxi for that distance on my own was too expensive and found it easier to simply crash at my friend’s. Again, he sent back a thumbs up. ‬

The next morning I arrive in to work and pretty soon after starting receive a text from my bf’s close friend (whom he works with) asking me why I didn’t go home. Confused, I reply that my bf knew I wasn’t coming back. He replied that bf lost his phone and actually had no idea where I was as he hadn’t seen my texts. He then curtly asked that the next time I “couldn’t afford” a taxi home, to call him and he’d pay for it. 

This both pissed me off and weirded me out but I put it to one side and replied that that wouldn’t be necessary and that, as no one had contacted me, I’d had no idea bf had lost his phone or was worried about me. He then jokingly replied that I’d done nothing wrong but to make sure to sleep in ‪the same bed as my bf each night. Again, I found this super intrusive and weird on his part but said nothing as I was more concerned about my bf. ‬

Later, after I arrived home I immediately asked my bf about everything and he seemed confused and said that he had seen all my messages and the only issue was that he was annoyed at me for not letting him know about not coming home sooner which is totally fair. 

I told him about his friend’s messages and he seemed even more confused, saying that he simply asked him to tell me he’d lost his phone, nothing more. This seriously pissed me off and I sent a text to the friend telling him never to send me a text like that again without first being sure of all the facts as it had caused unnecessary worry for me and I felt he’d crossed multiple boundaries. This text was sent a week ago and still no reply. I’m happy to move on and be friends but tbh I want an apology first. I feel like the friend was seriously out of line and had no business saying some of the things he said but my bf’s not too bothered by it and says he sees where the friend was coming from. 

Am I overreacting? Do I deserve an apology or AITA?"
5,dveorg,"AITA for ignoring my mate for taking bad pics of me I know the title sounds petty but hold on! 

I am very self conscious of how I look, my face is asymmetrical, I have a weak jawline and overall I'm not much of a looker and don't appreciate being reminded of my genetic misfortune. So when my friend kept taking multiple purposely bad photos of me without permission (bad angles, double chins, weird facial expressions) I got annoyed. When they sent these pictures to the guy I have been talking to (not a crush he's just a bit of an arsehole who will take the piss) I was especially ""annoyed"". It's not so much I care who these ugly photos have been sent to but that now they have them I'll never hear the end of it. These bad pictures will continue to crop up every now and again ""as a joke"" but tbh they might as well just call me ugly to my face because I just don't find them funny and they make me feel like shite. But anyway, I am currently ignoring them, they say I'm over reacting and that I have no reason to be pissed since it was just a joke but I don't see them taking the piss of my face (even though they say they're not) as a joke :)"
6,evbyg8,"AITA for finally poking back at my childfree sister-in-law? My wife's sister Abby is ""childfree.""  Neither my wife nor I could care less about whether Abby decides to have children, but over the years we have tolerated quite a bit of performative child-hating from her.  Calling children ""crotchfruit,"" talking about how dumb people are for becoming parents, and so on.

We had our first child last year and as a result she's been less outright rude about children but more bragging about how our lives are harder now and hers is free of responsibility. Stuff like ""I think I might go to Europe this summer.  I'll tell you about my trip for when you're able to go there in twenty years.""  Or talking about a concert she's going to go to, to which she says she'd thought about inviting her sister, ""but it starts at 9 o'clock and I'm sure you'll be in bed by then.""  You get the idea.

There have been lots of comments like this, but I've noticed that while Abby talks a big game, she never does seem to do any of the stuff she talks about.  She doesn't actually travel.  She doesn't ever seem to actually go to any of these concerts or shows or anything - whenever I ask her about them, she always tells some vague story about how she decided to skip it just this one time.  It seems to me like she likes the idea of having freedom more than she likes exercising that freedom.

She was over last weekend and had said something snarky about my kid so I was already kind of annoyed before she started talking at length about some TV show she'd been watching.  And I just couldn't help myself and said something to the effect of ""for a person with such a fun childfree lifestyle you sure do have a lot of Netflix recommendations.""

Anyway: she's really mad at me now.  AITA?

**EDIT:** OK, despite the top comment, there were enough ESH judgments in here that I went ahead and called her to apologize for being a dick.  She accepted it and admitted that she'd been pretty rude to us herself.  I have a lot more sympathy for her after this conversation - I don't think I understood quite how aggressively my mother-in-law pushed on both her daughters to provide grandchildren, and it seems likely that Abby has lashed out at us as a poor substitute for the things she wants to say to her mom.  Anyway, thanks for the help!"
7,cvjchn,"AITA for confronting my sisters dean. I'm 19f and my sister is 14 

so I found out last week that my sister is being bullied, this has been going on for the past few months and my parents have done next to nothing to stop it. 
this bully (14/15 year old female) has been calling my sister names like (bitch, fa**ot, ect..)
and has been tormenting her non stop. 

my sister is a absolute mess but my parents are doing nothing about it, I've asked my sister and all I got was that they told her to tell a teacher and when that fell through they seemed to not care. 

she told a teacher and the teacher did absolutely nothing and when she told mum and dad about it they shrugged it off and told here that she would just have to deal with it then.   

so I decided to speak to the dean of her year group myself and sort it out with him, he was super kind and will be speaking with the girl and her parents. 
I was as polite as i could be and made sure that the dean knew i was her sister and was just wanting to protect her. 

well my parents found out and they are incredibly mad, they now think I'm trying to be ""mummy"" and they do not want me to meddle in issues that do not involve me. 
mum was incredibly mad as she claimed she was ""sorting it"" (that's incredibly untrue lol) 

my sister is incredibly grateful and gave me a huge hug. 

AITA? did I overstep?"
8,c8jlvi,"WIBTA if I give my sister's bearded dragon away? Before I state the situation, I'd like to say that this situation would be a last resort. If things get bad enough, I'd of course speak to my sister before making any decisions, but if she refuses, I would most likely do this without consent if the situation calls for it.

A few months ago, my sister impulsively bought a bearded dragon from a PetCo when she found out her friend had one. She barely read any information on keeping a beardie before thinking she was already an expert.

First, she put a young bearded dragon in a cage with sand bedding. Every source I've read stated that sand bedding for young beardie's is a big no-no because they may ingest it and it could block their digestive system. Thankfully he only spent 2 days with the sand before I scooped it out and replaced it.

&#x200B;

She forgets to buy mealworms for him so he would eat only vegetables for weeks on end until she remembers to go to the pet store to pick them up. From what I read, vegetables should only be around 1/3 of their diet, so I know he shouldn't be eating them exclusively when he eats them on days he has actual mealworms to eat as well. Not to mention she forgets to give him fresh water too. There would be days when I would look into his cage and I'd find that his water bowl is bone dry and I'd discover my sister didn't fill his water for days.

&#x200B;

My sister smokes weed in her room, where she keeps his cage. She also brings in friends who end up smoking in her room as well, both weed and cigarettes. The beardie stays there the entire time.

&#x200B;

Very recently, I went into my sister's room in the morning to take him out of his cage for a little and I found his cage completely open and he wasn't inside. My friend found him under a box 5 minutes later and the poor thing was weak, cold, and bloated. I confronted my sister and informed her that she left the cage door open, thinking this was a mistake. She told me that she did it on purpose and she likes it when he gets out so he could explore. In the past, she also told me she lets him fall from high ledges and she doesn't pay any attention to him when he's out of his cage.

&#x200B;

From my own eyes, this poor thing is stressed out in her care. I know currently things may not call for such drastic measures, but it seems like she's becoming a worse owner every day, like she's getting bored of him. I'm worried for this poor thing and I know he would do better in more competent hands, even now, but that doesn't mean I would do this immediately. If things get bad enough, WIBTA?

&#x200B;

(I'm in no way an expert on bearded dragons. I have done my fair share of research on them so I could try to fill in the gaps of his care that my sister fails to fill and that's about it. If any of these situations aren't things that would be a big deal, please say so. I want to be able to make the right call and I don't want to make any mistakes about this.)"
9,99d35e,"WIBTA for not hiring someone based on the fact that they were awful to me in high school I recently got promoted and am in charge of hiring a whole new team. I’ve been doing interviews all week and I have a woman coming in tomorrow who I just realized was my high school ‘bully’ for lack of a better term. She has a different last name now so when I called her for an interview I didn’t realize who she was, and I only used my first name when I called her to set it up. I have been looking potential candidates up on LinkedIn and Facebook and when I found her profile I instantly recognized her. 

I was a year older than all the people in my grade because I started kindergarten late, not because I got held back or anything, but this girl told everyone it was because I was stupid and couldn’t pass my classes. She would also make fun of my hair and clothes and say I was going to die a virgin and stuff like that, and that my only friends were the anime characters I would draw (ok I did have a little bit of an anime phase but I didn’t like go over the top and do the Naruto run or anything and I got over it pretty quick, I just appreciated the artwork and still do). She also interrupted me while I was asking a girl to the prom and told her she could do better. Just dumb shit like that. 

It didn’t scar me for life or anything but she definitely made me feel like shit about myself a lot of the time and luckily I pretty much forgot about her once we all graduated and went off to college. I know she might have changed but I just don’t see myself working with and managing someone who was so rude to me all the time. 

And as tempting as it would be to have her come in and lord it over her during the interview that I’m not gonna hire her, I won’t do that because that’s petty and unprofessional. Really I just want to call her and tell her the position is filled so not to come in for an interview. But now I’m wondering if that would be shitty of me, maybe she has in fact changed and needs this job to support her family or something. What do you guys think?"
10,dc0sjt,"AITA for wanting to kick my friend out of my flat? Back in May, my best friend broke up with her boyfriend because he cheated on her. She had nowhere to live and so I said she could move with in me and my partner.
She is the highest earner in our place. She earns around £2000 a month. She LIED about this and told us she was earning a lot less. I found this out because I read her bank statement. We only asked her to pay us £300 a month to live here and that includes rent, taxes, food, gas, internet and electricity. Bearing in mind she also didn’t have to buy any furniture as our spare room was already kitted out. However, within a week of getting paid, her £2000 is like completely gone. I’m not sure how because she doesn’t ever come home with anything that she’s bought and I have no idea where her money is going. It’s starting to affect us because we are having to fork out money that we don’t really have to pay for her travel to work for the rest of the month and also for tobacco that my boyfriend gives her. We never ask her to pay us back and never ask for anything in return. I asked her for £400 a month today, which I feel is very reasonable, but she got annoyed about it.
As well as this, she is very lazy and doesn’t ever tidy up. I do all her washing up and fold her clothes up for her. She leaves talcum powder all over the bathroom floor and smokes in her room despite me telling her multiple times not to. Her room has plates and cups in it that have very old drinks and food on them, which she will then dump downstairs in the sink because she knows I will wash them up. 
I find myself having to avoid her and dread having to spend time with her when my partner isn’t here because she is the type of person to complain about everything. She never bothers to ask how we’re doing and only ever moans about her problems. When we have a problem, her problem has to be 10 times worse and will always take priority. Sometimes she comes into our bedroom screaming about her problems at work and now it’s stressful. Any advice we offer her she ignored and carries on complaining. 
She also seems to have a habit of making subtle digs towards me that stick with me and upset me a little. For example, she called me a bipolar bitch when I was having a down day and belittled the fact I went to the doctor to get medication. 
The cherry on top is when she left her diary in the living room. The page was ripped out and on the table. I was nosey and read it, and it said that she cheated on her boyfriend first. I was so angry because she made all of us feel bad for her, I let her live with me because I felt awful for what he did to her, she cried to us and we did everything we could for her but she cheated on him and I feel as though she has no right to stop us being friends with him and make us take her side because we all thought she was the victim. 
I want to know AMIA for wanting to kick her out because of all this, even though she literally has nowhere else to go?"
11,boapv7,"AITA for not letting my friend eat meat? So I (25M) have a friend named K (25M). Last month, he got diagnosed with ascertain condition that forces him to avoid certain foods (if not, he will have blocked arteries that have to be fixed with surgery). From that day on, he promised himself not to eat red meat and certain other foods and he told me that he gave me consent to stop him if I see him red meat. I asked him if he was serious and he said yes and that he could not control himself sometimes. So today, I saw him eating red meat and I said “dude you have to put it down, it’s bad for your heath”. He then told me that “it’s none of my buildings and to leave him alone. Then I proceeded to take away his food and gave him chicken which he likes. But he made a scene in public and told em to go fuck my self and begged me to give him his food back. However, I refused and told him that I would compensate him for his meal. This triggered him and he got in his car and left me at the park. I shared my story with my friends and they told me that I was shaming him and that I could not control what he eats. So AITA?"
12,b0fofq,"AITA for refusing to do something at work, and telling a new hire not to do it either, because I believed it was a bit unsafe? So I work at a company that drives to different clients to service equipment. I work with Mike (fake name). Mike is a new hire who comes with me to everything I do. All of the techs in our company are under our manager John (fake name). Thus I don't really have any ""authority"" to tell Mike what to do, but he'll still listen to me.

A store's fan was not working. After we isolated the problem to the fan itself, I told Mike to get the step ladder. In case you don't know, when you are on a step ladder, you're not supposed to stand on the top two steps. You're also not supposed to overreach. People break both of those rules regularly, almost always without injury. I was at the highest safe step and I could barely reach the fan. I would have had to break one of those rules to access it.

I called John.

> Me: ""Hey John, I'm at [store] with Mike and we need the bigger ladder.""

> John: ""The one in your truck should be fine.""

> Me: ""It's not.""

> John: ""Did you go all the way up?""

> Me: ""I went as far up as I am supposed to go. I can't reach it safely from there.""

> John: ""For fuck's sake, u/AdorablePreference. Let me speak to Mike.""

He apparently told Mike to ""just fucking do it."" Mike wanted to do it. I just said ""no you're not"" and I took the ladder down. Long story short, John drove over to fix it himself (in the unsafe way) as Mike and I watched.

Am I the asshole?

tldr I defied my boss because of a possibly unnecessary safety rule. I also brought another employee into the conflict."
13,d8d1ko,"WIBTA If I told my (16 F) Stepsister (17 F) that she needs to stop relying on me to wake her up for school in the morning? First ever Reddit post, hopefully this is right. 

For background info, my stepsister and I have been related ever since I was ~2 years old. Her and I don’t have a great relationship whatsoever, and she purposely does things to hurt me and piss me off.

My stepsister and I have been going to school together since middle school after I moved in with my dad and stepmom. Ever since we entered high school, she had started this thing where she refuses to get out of bed in the mornings, despite me waking her up constantly. It’s not something I want to do, but it’s only to help out my parents  (who will be late to work if they have to drive us to school). She gets mad at me, yells at me, throws a fit, all that stuff. Normally, I would understand why she’d be cranky, as when I’m being forced to wake up at 6 a.m. I’m pretty cranky too. Although, there’s this huge difference between the two of us. She likes to stay up all night blasting the television or talking on the phone while I prefer to go to bed at a decent time. Another thing is, she likes to constantly cause a ruckus and keep the rest of me and our family up while we are trying to sleep. I try to get over it, but I’m downright tired of being forced to fall asleep much later than I need to, and then having to deal with her berating me when I wake her up much later than I actually get up. Not only that, but our bus arrives around 6:30, it normally takes ~10 minutes for any normal person to get dressed and have time to gather their belongings and grab a bite to eat. Instead, she locks herself in the bathroom the entire time and refuses to let me take the two minutes I need to brush my hair, brush my teeth, and take a quick pee when I need to. Just this morning she locked herself in the bathroom the entire time and refused to let me in, and subsequently she was angry with *me* when she missed the bus because I “woke her up too late.” I didn’t even get a chance to wash up this morning and had to go to school looking like I just stumbled out of the morgue because I woke her up and she decided that she didn’t want to get ready because I “woke her up too early.”

I’m extremely tired of having her berate me for not waking her up earlier (which would mean I have to wake up earlier) but then having her complain at the same time that I wake her up too early. She has tons of alarm clocks, she just refuses to use them. I’m thinking of just telling her to wake herself up if she keeps treating me like shit because of it.

TL;DR: My stepsister gets mad at me for waking her up for school in the morning. WIBTA if I tell her to start waking herself up if she’s going to treat me like shit when I’m only trying to make sure she gets to school?"
14,ergc1h,"AITA for tellinng my parents that they ruined kids for me? During a family gathering my parents once again started asking me about when I'll give them grandbabies. I have been married for 3 years and neither me nor my husband have interest in having kids of our own. I usually just brush them off and walk away but this time they were being extremely persistent. Especially because my brothers and sisters were around and some of them already have families of their own, even though they're younger than me.

The reason why I'm not into the idea of having kids is that I had to play the role of a parent to all my siblings (6 of them). My parents were irresponsible and had me at 16. Once I was 5 they had my first sibling and the rest of them were born soon after. So since I was very young I had to help out my mother and supervise/take care of 6 kids while being a kid myself.

I never mentioned this to my parents because they never asked me my motives, in fact they brush off the excuses I give them. So I decided that maybe if I were honest they would finally understand but I was very wrong in that assumption.  My mother was crying halfway through the explanation and my father got very heated. I tried to have it be a private conversation away from where everyone else was but since things went downhill all my siblings got very curious about what had happened.

I had to then explain what had happened to my siblings which ended up turning into a bigger mess. I was called ungrateful, hurtful, asshole and cold hearted for not only blaming my parents but also for making my siblings feel like they were burdens. At this point my husband and I decided to leave, which only escalated things even further because I ended up getting kicked out of the family group chat and also have been blocked by most of them on social media.

Edit: I want to say thank you to everyone giving advice and being so kind. Also, to everyone that went through the same situation as me, I can't reply to you all but I'm reading everything."
15,c78bl3,"WIBTA If I told my (ex)friend's Dad about the lies she is telling about him? For some background info I (36F) made friends with a woman (31F) at my bingo group a few years ago. We became pretty close and would hang out at least once a week. During this time my life was getting turned upside down fairly regularly due to career changes, family issues, and a major health problem. 

Over time I noticed that whatever I or anyone else was going through in my life, somehow she was ""dealing with the same thing"" only worse. Her family is pretty well off, but she insisted that she was not supported by them and had to scrimp to even clothe her kids. That despite living with her father, he never helped with anything. She would tell people all sorts of stories about her family. Of the ones I remember;

1. That her father was extremely abusive to her mother, and had killed her in cold blood (but got away with it because he was rich.)

2. That her father made her pretend to be a boy until she was 17 because he didn't want a daughter.

3. That the females in her family were branded at birth and she was an outcast and denied all rights because she refused to allow them to brand her daughter.

4. That her brother was a meth addict and that his children were being taken away by the state and given to her. 

5. That she had a genetic disease that has made every member of her family go blind in their left eye. But don't ask them about it.

6. That her, her husband and children were going to be put in witness protection for testifying against her father. 

7. That the gym we were going to was calling her father and her brother to report everything we did.

8. That she had leukemia and was dying.

9. That she was a gold medal winning gymnast who had been forced to give up the Olympics  due to a heart condition.

If I won at bingo I would end up either giving my winnings to her due to some ""urgent need"" (ie. her cat was sick and the vet put it on a special diet that they couldn't afford, Her daughter needed a dress for a holiday concert at preschool).

Just before Christmas her car broke down and her father had given them a car for an early Christmas gift, but was refusing to help pay for it to get registered as he expected them to cover that cost on their own.  They were on a very fixed budget and couldn't afford the extra expense. 

 I saved all of my tips over the holiday to help with the registration costs. I saved up over $500 and presented her with it the next time I saw her. 

When I walked her to the car I saw that she already had the new licence plate and registration.  The next day she tells me that her father paid for new bowling shoes, balls, and paid all the fees for a league by giving her the exact amount I had given her, in cash. 

I stopped talking to her at that point.

 I figure she wrangled a couple thousand dollars out of me and I want them to know what she is doing."

Today we were pictures and one of my old photos of a girl in my class was in the camera. One of the boys asked who the girl was , and another boy responded with “that is what we call a slut”. He immediately said “I’m joking”, but If someone called me that, I would want to know. (I am a guy by the way). Will I be the asshole if I told her and get the boy in trouble  or should I let it slide?"
17,bk3ww5,"AITA for not being willing to get married to my girlfriend, who has overstayed her visa? Just want to preface this by saying my Mom’s on going cancer battle has killed quite a bit of the empathy I used to have, it’s been emotionally draining, and may have thrown my perspective on my girlfriend’s situation. 

My (29M) girlfriend (27) is from Southeast Asia, came to the US on a visa, and got a job at an apparel startup. I met her about a month before her visa expired and she had been in contact with an immigration lawyer trying to get her into the H-1B lottery. The immigration lawyer botched the paperwork and missed the application deadline. She didn’t leave before the deadline and wouldn’t be able to re-enter the US for 3 years, which I didn’t think was so bad considering if she overstayed an additional 6 months, she wouldn’t be able to re-enter for another 10 years. She said even 3 years is too much of a setback and decided not to go back to her home country. She has been continuing to work at the startup, while also working on launching her own apparel business, already putting production orders in. Her boss has let her know that after year-end he will no longer keep her on as an independent contractor and must be on payroll, which she can now only do if she marries a US citizen. She has also hit roadblocks in setting her business up due to her immigration status. At this point the 6 month window has also passed, so if she leaves now she won’t be able to re-enter for 10 years. 

I have been dating her for 10 months now and about two weeks ago she started really pressuring me on getting married, which I’ve said is something that I’m not ready for right now. She says that getting married can solve all of her problems and has likened me to someone who has the cure for cancer and won’t give it to someone they love, which seems like her just trying to relate her situation to my Mom’s. She says that I’m the most selfish person she has ever met and that I’ve ruined her life. I don’t want to get married just to solve a problem, I want to get married because I am certain want that person in my life forever. In these past 10 months I haven’t spent enough time with her to know that, so I’m not willing to get married to her. 

Am I the asshole?

Update: The relationship is over, I won’t be speaking with her again. Thanks to everyone who took the time to share their perspective, it has given me clarity when I badly needed it and I really appreciate it."
18,8vfd2w,"AITA for getting mad at my sister’s boyfriend? So I just got back from college to find out that my sister (whos in high school) has been dating this guy. She’s never dated anybody before so shes super excited about it, the only problem is that I dont like him at all. To start off he tried to take her out to a party for her first date, and I dont care if she drinks or parties or anything, I just thought that was kind of lame, and when she said no to the party he called it off. Secondly he came over the other day for a pool party she was throwing and acted like a complete idiot. Firstly he looked through my stuff and found my Airsoft gun, then he tried to shoot one of my sister’s friends with it I kind of freaked out when he did this because not only should you not do that, but he also tried it from point blank range which can cause some damage. After this he proceeded to go onto our xbox (to play fortnite) and message everyone on my xbox live profile obscenities. The problem with this is that this used to be my dads old profile, and still has a lot of his work friends friended on it, so when I found out about this I was like “wtf did you do man” and basically guilt tripped him really badly. Now despite him otherwise being an idiot in my opinion he seems like an okay guy, and my sister is really mad at me for freaking out at him for the gun thing and the messages. I feel a little bad, but also feel like the guy (who is not much younger than me by the way) kind of brought it on himself. AITA?

A friend of mine lost his apartment (eviction) and I tried helping him out by letting him stay with me rent free (which is something we agreed on so he can save up and get back on his feet). He stayed with me for 2 months, He spent those 2 months on my couch, not working, and trying to get tinder dates. Every time I asked him about his job he said he doesn’t work that day.

this has all been done by my roommate. 

I have used one plate this entire week (I wash and dry it every use)

he normally leaves a mess like this every week so does the dishes as he runs out of plates and bowls.

22,cdn1p5,"AITA for deciding on a different middle name for my son than originally planned? Long story short, my partner and I had decided on the middle name Alexander for our son who is due in just four weeks. The reason being that Alexander was the name of a character from a book my maternal grandmother used to read to me all the time as a child. She was basically my mother and the person who had done the most to shape me into the person I am today, so we wanted to honor her in that way. She really was the most significant person in my life. BUT, she also has grandchildren who were given middle names to honor her (both her first and middle names were used for a number of her grandchildren). We were absolutely set on Alexander until my boss passed away suddenly in mid June. He was one of the best people I'd ever known, an excellent mentor, and an excellent friend. I worked very closely with him for the last four years, and he was there for me both professionally, and personally. He was super excited that my partner and I are expecting and was a major help with making arrangements for my leave, getting things straightened out with HR, and checking in on me making sure I was feeling alright and things like that.  So when he passed away, me, as well as everyone we work with took it hard. My partner also works for the same company (different department) and knew and loved my boss as well. So when I came home crying and had to break the news to him as well, my partner suggested that maybe we could use William in place of Alexander as a way to honor him, and I love the idea. That being said, my mother has been absolutely *nasty* about it. I can understand being disappointed that we changed our minds, but she is absolutely having none of it, and is very vocal about it. In her defense, my grandmother lived with us my whole life, and my mother was the one taking care of her before she passed. She took her death very hard and that's more than understandable. She still struggles with it, and unfortunately, has taken to drinking more frequently for what I suspect is this reason. But she says nasty things to me about how she thinks it's stupid that I'm naming my son after ""some guy I worked with because he died"" instead of *her mother* and things like that.She frequently brings it up and tries to guilt me over my decision.  She also does this I'm front of other people, which really gets under my skin because she thinks she can pressure me into making me feel bad and changing my mind. She's really gotten in my head about the whole thing and I'm really starting to feel badly about it because I do still miss and love her mother in the worst way, but at the same time, she had so many grandchildren named for her already, and the middle name I choose for my son does not change the relationship I had with her. Not to mention it isn't even her actual name that we are forgoing. Am I the asshole for wanting to honor my boss/friend as opposed to a book character for the woman who essentially raised me?"
23,cza6k9,"AITA for indirectly calling someone fat who directly called me skinny So I've been the same over 6', 180lbs since high school. I'm now in my 40s. I like some other have a fast metabolism. I can eat basically whatever I want and don't gain an ounce. I don't go around bragging about it ands it took me a long time to accept that I'm skinny and most likely always will be. I love it now but as a teenage and early 20s not so much.

Over the years you can imagine how many times I've heard ""Your're so skinny, you need to eat"" ""You should let me feed you some real food to gain weight"" ""Why you so skinny? Don't you eat?"", etc etc etc. It just been a life long thing.

Normally I'm always in a good mood and brush these comments off. But today I kinda felt over it. And on the train into work a lady sat down and we exchanged morning hellos. Then out of the blue she says your so thin you should eat more to which I replied, ""NAH then I'd have to watch what I eat and go a diet like you""

Her faced expression immediately changed and she said I didn't have to be so rude. Whatever, nobody ever gets called out for calling skinny people skinny but heaven forbid you even mention someone is overweight. AITA?"
24,b6sgeb,"AITA for 'threatening' to end a close friendship with said friend being severely depressed We've been close friends for 4 years. During that time we both hit our lowest with depression and he was one of my strongest anchors during it (I relied heavily on my friends as they were my main support). We both got better, I left school for the rest of the year to 'survive' and recovered within approx. 6 months (no longer depressed) and he got better but not 'cured'.

&#x200B;

Through the depression I had a migraine every week or so. But that then got worse and for the past year and a 1/2 I've had chronic migraines with it starting at 4 a week and now for the past 3 months being everyday. These were almost always (are now always) severe, incapacitating migraines, being constant 9-10/10 (pain) migraines Also due to a rare diagnosis of spinal leaks, they're very prone to get worse with any kind of vertical movement i.e. sitting, standing which essentially caused me to be bedridden and not able to attend classes or do much of anything for the past 6 months.

&#x200B;

During this half year my friend's depression got worse. Not as bad as it had been but really bad (took medical leave multiple times etc.). He was already bad at online communication but with school which he somewhat despised and the worsening depression it got worse. He and most of my friends dropped communication with me due to my physical absence. I did however reach out to them enough to have a kind of social life. Wasn't the case with him. Despite me trying to text/talk with him, he almost never replied.

&#x200B;

This changed when he got a girlfriend who is also depressed. I was friends with her so this created a new cycle where the only responses I got from him were either asking me to help talk her down when they struggled and the more common one of 'help gf'. She was my friend so I obviously helped and ended up doing so a lot. I don't blame her for any of this because she needed help and because of her partner who wasn't able to deal with it majority of the time (depression) and an unhealthy relationship with her parents, she needed more. I ended up doing a crap ton of chaos management.

&#x200B;

My only hopes through this half year was that when breaks happened he and I'd get to spend time together online. During breaks the responses I got were either today isn't gonna work because of business, attempted coping or variations of 'maybe' aka no. Near the end of the break, he confirmed with me that today was the day, we'd hang/play games together. We arranged a time and I started getting excited. After about an 2 hours past said time I texted asking whats going on and he replied that he was playing with a friend that he'd had over at his house twice in the break for a few days at a time. It was also a game that could host 4 people online. This along with the rest resulted in me going ham over text and getting really upset (swearing etc.), and insinuating that something needed to change or I wasn't going to continue the friendship."
25,etgj25,"WIBTA if I (21F) told people in my lectures to stfu So I go to a university with pretty massive lecture halls meaning the professor really can't hear if people sitting in the middle/back are talking. 

Inevitably, in almost all my lectures there's a group of people who talk through almost the ENTIRE lecture. Now I don't mind whispering or talking for a couple minutes. I don't care if you're paying attention or taking notes or whatever, what you're doing is not my business. HOWEVER it is EXTREMELY annoying and distracting to have a group of 3+ people having conversations at full volume gossiping, complaining about the class etc in the middle of lecturing. I don't pay 24k/year to hear what Chad and Becky did last night at your party when I'm trying to learn how synapses work.

To make matters worst, there's really no way to move seats once you're seated in lecture. Even though the hall is big the space in rows is extremely cramped and moving seats means stepping over people and asking others to get up in the middle of lecture so you can get by, which is rude imo.

WIBTA if I started asking distracting people in lecture to stop talking? I don't know how to approach it politely. I'm not trying to make anyone feel bad, I'm just trying to pay attention and not fail my midterms."
26,bbcxdr,"AITA for telling a co-worker's boss that she posted on Facebook that she ""told her bosses she was quitting but they didn't accept it""? Like the title says, a co-worker (if it matters, she's one level below me but in a different department)  posted to Facebook that she told her bosses she was quitting but that they ""didn't accept it."" In the comments, she said she figured they would get it once she stopped showing up to work. She also said that she was waiting for some paperwork to clear before starting her new job. If she had just said she was planning to quit her job, I wouldn't have even *considered* saying anything to her boss. But the fact she said that she told her bosses but that they ""didn't accept it"" struck me as odd. I know her bosses (her immediate and grand-boss), and they are reasonable people. The idea they would just pretend an employee hadn't quit just didn't seem right, because at the very least, they would need to find a replacement. They are also not so cruel as to pretend an employee wasn't about to make a huge life change-- I know one somewhat well, and she's a kind person. Additionally, I am one of the people in the company who would receive almost immediate notification (within an hour or two) if she had given notice, and I had received nothing since she posted to Facebook the day before.

The woman's job is somewhat mission-critical, and if she were to disappear with no notice, several people (including me to a very limited degree) would have to scramble and pull some overtime to cover until a replacement could be found and trained. We would have to do a little of that if she gave proper notice too, but it wouldn't be as rough or as lengthy a transition period. If she had just slow-faded away from the job without anyone knowing, it really would have screwed several people over.

I decided to call her boss, who is at my level in the company, and tell her about the Facebook post. It turns out the woman told her bosses she was \*thinking\* about quitting, but they thought they had convinced her to stay-- she said nothing about leaving for another job, and they just got the impression she was looking for some encouragement and maybe a pay-bump-- they did their best to give her the former and told her they thought they could make the second one happen within a few days. Apparently, the woman called in sick today. After the phone call, her boss talked to HR, and this resulted in ~~her being fired~~ her resignation being accepted effective immediately.

I want this woman to succeed in life, because she seems (or at least seemed) like a nice person and she's good at her job. But I still feel guilty and like I did something wrong.

Edits: HR called to fill me in. She wasn't fired. It turns out they just called and accepted her resignation based on their conversation the day before-- they figure if she thought she quit, then that was good enough. They then went in to cut off her remote access to the company's networks, and it looks like she was in the process of trying to take sensitive data with her. Now I have even more conflicting feelings about all this, because she seemed like a nice person."
27,a8p43o,"AITA after telling my brother to stop being immature and to stop talking to me about anime For some background my brother is turning 19 in a few months and is in this senior year of high school, and I few months ago a turned 15 and am a freshman, I'm also a lesbian which becomes important later.

For over a year I have been telling my brother that I dont like anime, and that I don't like talking about video games, because he cares about stats and tier lists, which I don't care about.

Ever since I came out, a month before my birthday, he has made slightly creepy comments on lesbians in pop culture and anime. Like, he will talk about how a show he watches is filled with lesbians. When I tell him that I find that anime turns lesbians into a fetish and it's one of the main reasons I don't like anime, and that I like shows like Gumball and She-ra. He then goes on about Cal-Arts style and how my reasoning is poor.

He has also called me basically ""lesser minded"" when he told me about a cross dresser in anime that becomes trans. I told him that while trans representation is good, posing them as ""traps"" is not good. Where he then called me stupid in fancy terms.

Yesterday, while we were eating, he told me how I'd love visual novels and dating sims, when I told him I wouldn't and I'd rather read an actual book; he said I was not seeing outside myself.

Today I couldn't take anymore of this, we were out by ourselves, and the whole day he talked anime and how much I would love it if I watched one with a lesbian king Arthur (???), how I would love visual novels. When I told him the types of games I did like, he told me I couldn't tell good game desgin, mind you this was for a game he had never played, only watched youtube videos about.

After about 2 hours of this, when we got back in the car and he started talking about anime again, I told him directly that I despised anime, and that I wanted him to not talk to me about this stuff, and that he was always being immature about it, since I having been telling him for over a year. He then said he wasn't being immature. When I directly told him to talk about something else, he started talking about politics, when I told him I don't like politics, he told me I was being stupid and that I need to be educated before voting. I told him that not wanting to talk about politics isn't being stupid, he said I was wrong.

28,ejav3p,"AITA for telling my (48F) daughter (25F) to stop hassling me to buy stuff from my grand daughters (7F) school? Ugh. My grand daughter is in second grade ( in America) and in a public school that is ALWAYS sending crap home with the kids to sell to “ raise money” for the school????

It’s ALWAYS something that they have her selling. Valentine’s Day crap, easter crap, christmas crap, thanksgiving crap, random crap. 

They send catalogs home with the kids which falsely advertise this junk making it look fancy in the pictures but when you finally get the crap, it looks nothing like the picture or it’s already broken. This crap is not cheap either. Everything ranges from 20 dollars and up. The cheapest thing is like a tiny box with 4 tiny peanut butter cups in it for 20 dollars. I bought a 50 dollar necklace from her Christmas catalog full of crap and it was delivered all knotted up and couldn’t even be used. 

The final straw was a 2020 calendar which I purchased for 30 dollars which turned out not to even be a real calendar, it was a raffle ticket that I bought to enter to win a calendar. 

I told my daughter that was the final straw and she needs to stop hassling me to buy this shit because it’s not cheap and it’s all garbage. 

My daughter was upset and she said it was the least I could do to show support to my grand daughter by buying this shit and she said that I am not being a good grandmother.

29,d3zesk,"AITA For Wanting my Dad to Reach Out to Me First? My Younger sister recently told me that my dad wanted to know why I didn't talk to him and really wishes to be a part of my life. I told her that I'm open to it, but I'm not going to be the first to reach out. I feel like I deserve an apology because he was indifferent to me growing up and I don't feel like I should have to be the one to begin to mend things over. She feels like I should make the first move.

Backstory:

Me and my Dad don't have much of a relationship. He was in and out of my life for the first four years and my grandmother raised me until I was 7 and we all moved in together. Even during that time, It was never quite positive. I was the eldest kid of three and my dad remarried.  Because of this, my two younger siblings often got preferential treatment growing up. They would often argue, fight with other kids and even steal and rarely were  grounded but I'd be treated like a menace if I did so much as not sweep the floor to their liking. I remember once, after Visiting my biological mom for a week or two, my dad ground me for a week for just about no reason. Every time I'd  try to confide in him, or ask for advice, He'd berate me at best or bring it up at some point later on to make fun of me if I annoyed him.

Even as I got older, he never really invested much time in me; I was great in choir and in just about every concert I'd have a solo. Despite this, he'd just drop me and my grandmother off and go home and watch TV.  It kinda hurt being praised by so many strangers but my own father couldn't care less. I even won a free trip to DC once because I won a Japanese language speaking contest and he was more interested in figuring out how my clothes got into his hamper.  Growing up it was always this. Any good thing I'd do he'd ignore but if I slipped up he'd have a field day and wouldn't let it go for weeks.  He called me a Failure at 15 for not having a job, and once I did, charged me rent. And the rent didn't go to anything responsible, like a college fund. I asked him and he laughed at me... It just went to my stepmom's pocket.

 The final straw that broke the camel's back was back when I was 23 and going through a rough patch. I won't go into detail but I was teetering on homelessness and barely eating. I asked him for $40 for food out of desperation, and he said he didn't have it. I found out days later that he flew out to Michigan first class and stayed at an expensive hotel for a vacation.

Despite this, I recently borrowed my stepmom(his wife) $750 to get her car out of repossession. Only reason I did that was because she was helping out my younger sister with rides to her work and she has a young child. I'm not sure if I'll ever actually get it back. It was the first time any one of them has called me in probably two or three years.

There's plenty of other stories but I feel like this gives a good overview of our relationship. So, AITA for feeling like I shouldn't have to be the one to reestablish communications?"
30,eau3tx,"AITA for disliking the Christmas gifts my friend gave me because they're opposite of everything I wanted? I know it sounds like I'm a selfish ass (maybe I am? That's why I'm here lol) Over the years a good friend of mine and I have always had fun with Christmas. Our gifts to each other often had a very strong meaning. I won't lie, my friend thinks very highly about herself and is a very, very talkative person, who is very blunt about her accomplishments. I'm very timid, so she talks more, I listen, it worked out lol. Despite this, she has always known me and makes an effort to listen.

Well fast forward to this year, sometime in July she was hired into a high paying job and has decided to move into her own home. She also started dating. All of this has consumed her life. Whenever we get together, she talks about all of these achievements nonstop that I feel, well that effort to listen to me isn't there anymore. Anything I say ends up going through one ear and out the other. Instantly the subject changes to her job, boyfriend or house.

We exchanged gifts and I guess they made me think this is more than just a feeling. She got me a coffee mug, despite me two weeks back complaining about how I don't even drink coffee and still I have twenty mugs. I also changed my major, which was a big step for me. This occurred in August and I talked about it to her about my new classes. Well, she gets me two books about my old major, with her telling me she hopes they'll help me in my studies. To top it off, she also gave me a box of cheap hot chocolate mix.

I thanked her and am grateful for the items, but I feel rather guilty about not liking them. And yet I'm also angry that I feel like my closest friend has no interest in me or what I'm doing anymore. AITA for not liking my gift?"

AITA for buying Christmas gifts/souvenirs for my stepdad but not my stepmother? 

I (26f) have always had a great relationship with my stepdad but a pretty tense one with my stepmom. Over the 7 years she has been with my father she has repeatedly not invited me and my sister to “family” events, accused us of stealing her alcohol, bashed and refused to be around my mother who has never been rude to her, forced my dad to include her on family tradition guys trips and said that anything she purchased can’t be used by me or my sister. 

I see my dad a lot less because he is always doing things with her family and I just don’t feel welcome. 

For Christmas I give my dad his present and don’t get her anything. But I get my mom and stepdad gifts. When I go on trips I often buy a souvenir for my stepdad, mom and dad but not my stepmom.

32,b4mg1p,"AITA for refusing to cancel my plans? I have a co-worker at my workplace who I would consider to be friends with, we sometimes hang out after work or do stuff on the weekends. Usually when I try to make plans with him I always get the typical ""sure, I don't have any plans yet but I can't if I am spontaneously going out"" which in 80% of all cases means that he won't have time since he would rather hang out with other people (notifiying me half an hour before we were planned to meet), making me sort of feel like the second choice he has to do something with when all his other plans get cancelled.

I don't know how many times I was stood up waiting for him just to get a text half an hour before telling me that he won't come.

Today, he asked me if I wanted to go out to eat something, but I was already invited by my family for dinner. So I told him I can't come.
As a result to this, he got a bit mad and said that I should cancel since I can have dinner with my family any other day as well.
I refused, saying that they invited me weeks ago unlike him (2 hours before he wanted to go out) and if he wanted to reschedule.

It never got to the reschedule part since he was so mad at me for being so unspontaneous, that I did not get another answer.

I feel like it's just fair that I refuse to cancel my plans with my family, simply because his plans were cancelled and was spontaneously looking for something else to do.
Especially since he refuses to make set plans with me any time I ask.

So, AITA for refusing to cancel my plans to meet his schedule?"
33,cz86v4,"AITA for not attending my father's wedding I (f/27) was informed less than a week ago that my dad (m/50) and his s/o are getting married in Jamaica in a month and a half.

I brought up that I was hurt because I felt excluded for several reasons, one of them being that they knew I was coming home in August. They then decided to hold a bbq 2 weeks before my arrival, invite all the family, and he proposed then. 

They were under the impression I knew, and admitted to fucking up with telling me about the plans of them doing a destination wedding. They said it was just going to be the two of them, then do the reception in our hometown. I brought up there's an issue with the reception in the hometown because it's so last minute I may not be able to attend as I live in another province. 

Later that night, I get a call saying they called everyone (my boyfriend included) and that they're willing to fly everyone out to Jamaica and if no one can make it then they won't go. Everyone said they were able to make it, so it was up to me whether or not everyone goes. 

I processed it for a few days and deep down felt very uneasy about this as I'm already taking 2-week vacation a week after the wedding (my vacation was planned 7 months ago, this wedding was planned last week), and I'm taking 5+ weeks off medical leave due to surgery. 

The fact that my dad is expecting me to jump in and out of work so freely, I believe is unfair. They're all legitimate reasons but my work has gone beyond and above to accommodate me. To add on several more days of vacation days due to my family's lack of planning seems to be an unfair request. 

I've only been there for a year, and with all the budget cuts, I shouldn't be fucking around with my job because they can easily lay me off and keep someone who has been more reliable for the team. Even if they gave the go-ahead, I believe there will still be covert consequences in regards to how the team sees me. 

I put high importance on my job as I worked very hard to get where I am, and finding another job in the field would be extremely hard, and I also am unable to afford being unemployed or working for lesser wage due to the rising cost of living. I don't have anyone else who would be able to catch me if I fall. All I have is myself. 

My other option is to push my surgery another 6 months, which is difficult in terms of my mental health and I've already gone through weeks of precipitory anxiety and have already put so much energy into preparing myself, preparing my new temporary job position, and just preparing life for those 5 weeks or so. 

Called my father last night, he told me im selfish and ruining the wedding. They don't want anything to do with me if I don't attend this wedding, and they said they're still flying everyone out regardless if I can't go. 

Am I being the asshole in this situation? Or do the options seem unfair?

Edit to add: at this point I don't care if they do the wedding in Jamaica and the reception in our hometown. I'll spend the $600 to fly out for one night if that's what will make them happy, but at this point that does not seem to be an option for them anymore.

34,ap8ua8,"AITA for asking for a refund over an untracked order that never arrived? Two months ago, I bought a collector's item off of a guy abroad for a little over $130. He offered me to send it untracked for a much cheaper shipping price. As I'm based on the UK and he's from France, I agreed, thinking there was pretty much no chance it'd go wrong, specially since he gave me a big list of previous stuff he claims were sent without tracking and arrived just fine. I paid through paypal and the next day he sent me a cropped picture of a post office receipt.

Time passed, the ETA came and went, but nothing arrived. I kept communicating with him, and he asked me to wait. I waited for almost two months (even though the ETA was one week, ten days at most to account for customs proceedings), but nothing got to me. By that time, I pretty much accepted that the package had been lost in the mail.

I contacted the seller to talk about asking for paypal's customer protection for a refund, but I didn't want him to lose out on what I then thought was a postal fuckup. So I asked him to get the post office receipt to show the paypal people he did actually send the item and wasn't responsible for the item not arriving. 

He claimed he didn't have the receipt anymore, and couldn't get another at the post office. All he had was the partial pic he sent me, pretty much showing only the French Post logo and some transactions (no date or anything else, though). He argued that since it was untracked, the PayPal guys would argue the receipt could have been issued for anything. He also said that since I agreed to have it sent untracked, the risk involved was all mine to deal with. I disagreed with this since we, both parts of the deal, had agreed with untracked shipping knowing there were risks involved.

Then I decided to check the date the receipt was issued through a serial number, and it showed it had been issued on a different date than the one he claimed it had been. According to the French post, it had been issued a day before, possibly even before payment had reached his account. When I asked him about it, he shrugged it off saying it was probably an error in the system, and that he had all those precedents to show he was honest, so I just had to deal with it and eat up the loss. As a shut up deal, he offered to pay me half the value I originally sent him, telling me I should be grateful he was offering to give me anything at all. All the while, he was very rude about it.

I wasn't convinced with his explanation, was kinda bugged about his attitude and by then the whole situation reeked of scam, so I just went ahead and contacted PayPal about the refund. Ends up I got it in full. Have no idea if the seller had to pay up or not, as I blocked him. AITA?"
35,boyzue,"WIBTA if I cut my mother off financially when she has no real income? I have been supporting my mother financially for the better part of the last 5 years.  I pay all of her expenses and purchased her a inexpensive car to drive around.  She was recently approved for SSI, though that only amounts to $400-$500/month.  

I truly think that she would have trouble working, she's had multiple serious injuries from falls in the past few years.  Frustratingly though, I have had to essentially completely take over for her applying for her disability and retirement, and with working 55 hours a week and having a new baby, we did not get the paperwork into the office in time for the disability, and were denied.

She seems genuinely jealous of my wife, and and recently deleted her on Facebook because of a political post. She is also just generally rude to her. For years I just chalked it up to ""My mom being my mom.""  It's just normal behavior from her.  She also seems to be spending $300-400/month on cigarettes.  These two points are what have motivated me to think about cutting her off. She will also berate me from time to time that I'm not taking care of her enough and that her children are ungrateful towards their mother and so on and so forth.

The largest problem, and the reason I think I WBTA, is that I expect my mother to shut herself away from everyone and refusing to answer contact attempts if I cut her off.  I worry that she would not be able to, or choose not to, pay any of her bills or take care of herself.  I am frustrated with my mother and the way she treats my family and me, but I also feel like if I don't take care of her, no one will. My siblings have all more or less cut off contact with and support to her, which I do understand.  I also feel like she will never take the steps to taking care of herself financially if I continue to take care of her.  

TLDR: WIBTA if I cut my mom off, even though she may not be able to/or choose not to provide for herself if I did."

I asked my brother for his headphones the other day, and I accidentally used the music too loud and I blew out the speakers.  I apologized but he was pretty pissed at me and told me I have to pay him back, I ordered another pair online as a sorry and gave him an old pair of apple EarPods I own.  I thought everything was good but I wake up to the SD card I use for EVERYTHING snapped in two, and a note saying ""don't break my headphones next time.  The thing about this SD card is that I've had it since I was like 8 and it has some very very personal shit and memories ill never get back now cause he thought I purposefully broke his headphones.  I was LIVID when he did that and I told him what he did was unacceptable, and that he will have to pay for his own headphones and I withdrew my order.

I now refuse to speak to him, he has tried to talk to me a couple times but I flat out ignore him.  I won't talk to him until I get an actual apology which he won't give me.

AITA for not talking to my brother till I get an apology?

UPDATE:Well this is a big update, so my brother didn't break my SD card.  He got one that looked like mine and broke that and just hid my real SD card.

37,dao6ps,"AITAH for calling my pregnant sister a bitch This all started because I was helping her look at strollers for her baby. I noticed she continually used the word ""ghetto"" to describe a stroller she did not like. After about 5 times of her saying it, I hesitantly, but quietly told her ""relax"" in a tone to show that it isn't a big deal if a stroller wasn't to her liking. I did not tell her to relax in a rude way. I simply did not like that she had to describe something as ""ghetto"" when she could have just said she didn't like it. It came off very classist and snobby. When I told her that, she said ""whatever"" and walked away as if she was some teenager (she's 30). When I was asked by my dad why I was being quiet after that, I said bc of ""rude people"" hinting at my sister and from there it exploded. She began yelling at me at the store and mocking me for calling her out. I told her it wasn't necessary to describe something she doesn't like as ""ghetto"". I told her to get over herself and be humble. She came from the ""hood"", so for her to associate a STROLLER as something inferior, just pissed me off. She got out the hood but acted like she was never part of it. i told her it was about basic respect. If she's associating a stroller as ghetto, how does she actually see people who are from ""the ghetto"". She kept mocking me for defending ""the people"" even though I never brought up ""the people"", and I just snapped and said ""why are you being such a bitch?"" and she turned back and raised her fist at me like she was about to swing at me. This was in public at a department store. she gave no fucks and continued to yell and say ""shut the FUCK up"" and ""stop acting like you're tough"" and mocked me for crying (I tend to cry, I dont care) and I don't like that she tries to use that against me. She used her pregnancy to justify her behavior. But I told her she is the same way even when she isn't pregnant (it's true, she easily snaps). All because I said ""relax"" in a non-offensive tone. Am i the asshole for telling her to relax and later on calling her a bitch? at the same time, I don't like that she raised her fist at me. no person should feel the right to do that, even when mad, especially to a younger sibling. It's inexcusable behavior in my opinion. please tell me what you think

&#x200B;

EDIT: I'd like to mention that since this has happened, she has not contacted me since. But she calls my dad repeatedly to gossip about my other sister. I have no intention of speaking to her soon and I plan on skipping her baby shower. She apologized to me after what happened about raising her fist at me, but not about what she told me afterwards and how she yelled at me in public. In fact, she went as far to make it seem like what /I/ said (calling her a bitch) was out of anger and did not mean to say it. trust me, I do not regret a thing that I said to her there."
38,c4pm0e,"aita for eating my flatmate’s food? she went on holiday last week, and when she left she told me i could eat some of her food out of the fridge. i didnt really eat any of it, but i did eat some of her sweets out her cupboard and some cheese. i went to the shop the day before she got back and replaced the sweets and cheese, and bought extra on both since she didnt actually say i could eat that stuff. i messaged her saying i did this and she’s now really angry at me, has sent several paragraphs about how money is tight and she doesnt want me to eat her food. 

i could understand the anger if i had just eaten it and not told her or bought more but she is now better off, has extra food than she had before she left and i didnt think she’d mind about me eating as she gave consent for other stuff to be eaten and i replaced it before she got back.

40,bvhjst,"AITA for giving our kid ""boring"" lunches for school? Our daughter in grade 1 has got us complaints from her teacher and the school administration about her lunches. We tend to give her healthier stuff, stuff we eat at home anyways but try to make it more ""snack focused"" if that makes sense. A typical lunch might be a few slices from a baguette or some crackers, some cold cuts (prosciutto, salami, etc), olives, sundried tomatoes, etc. Or sometimes we'll give her things like rice pudding, sausage, once we even gave her some steak to bring to school. I'm just listing things we've got complaints over.

The school argues we're being ""abusive"" by giving her foods the other kids won't like, thus eliminating a ""sharing environment"". She hasn't been teased for her lunches and by her own admission likes what we give her. It's the teacher who thinks it's age inappropriate. I personally argue that what we normally give her is little different from a lunchable, what they suggested we give her. Once we gave her some anchovy fillets for crackers, etc and they confiscated her lunch, which prompted a big argument between us and the school.

I said that's a restriction you're setting on yourself, I have no problem with you playing or watching whatever. And then he got pissy saying it was stopping him doing his own thing and I said again that it was his choice that's stopping him, not me.

42,c9ov16,"AITA for not wanting to live in a rural area? My wife and I met in a large city, where she was finishing her PhD. I'm a native of this city and she is from a small, rural community most of the way across the country. Once things started to get serious we had a discussion regarding whether I would be willing to leave the area with her, since she had no plans to stay there after finishing her PhD. I had a decent job, but wasn't in love with it and had no qualms about leaving.

&#x200B;

The only stipulation I had was that I didn't want to live in an overly rural area. I don't want to have a 20+ minute drive to the nearest store. I'm a gamer, and we long ago cut the cord, so we need a decent internet connection. She agreed and that was that.

&#x200B;

We made wedding plans. Literally one week before the wedding, however, her mother passed away very unexpectedly. Absolute tragedy. All of us were gutted. After the funeral we returned home, and had our postponed wedding. She finished her dissertation and started looking for jobs. She wanted to be as close to her family as possible, since we were still less than a year from her mothers death. She found a job a couple hours away from her home and we moved, leaving my family, job, and everyone I had ever known more than 1000 miles away. After 3 years there she doesn't like the way the place is being run and finds a better job in a city 30 minutes from her home. So much closer to her family and a better paycheck. Win/win!

&#x200B;

Over the last few years though, she has increasingly brought up her desire to move back to her family farm. It's a very rural area with zero cell reception and no cable. She knows I am against it, and always starts off with ""It just makes me so sad that you would never want to move there."" Which I feel is a bit manipulative.

&#x200B;

I can see it from her perspective. She wants to be closer to her now retired dad. But from my perspective, she is complaining about being 30 minutes away from her family instead of **literally** on the same property as them. I haven't even *seen* my family in 4 years. I gave up everything to come with her, no questions asked. She tells me I'm an ass when I get frustrated with her for repeatedly bringing it up and making me out to be the bad guy, when its something we had discussed before we got married.

&#x200B;

I'm putting my foot down because of a shitty internet connection and no cell reception, the massive downgrade in school quality, + a long drive into town whenever you need anything...and with 3 small children we always need something...

She pretty clearly got the lions share of the compromise as far as where we live, and I feel like I'm justified in saying we need to stay in the bigger town as the lone positive I get out of it.

43,b5tdeb,"AITA for getting mad at a girl for not revealing she was trans? So basically I met this girl on Tinder, and we instantly had an amazing connection. I've met lots of people off the app and I can tell you, I've never wanted someone as badly as I wanted her before actually meeting IRL. Due to life circumstances getting in the way, we chatted non-stop for 2 weeks. Conversations about everything, our traumas, hopes and dreams, our childhood stories, our secrets... Needless to say, I was falling for her HARD and I was super anxious to meet up. The night before our first date I could hardly fall asleep, and she felt the exact same way about me. 

&#x200B;

Also, it's worth mentioning that we had been sexting really hardcore for days before our date, and basically there was the assumption that we would absolutely ravish each other the second we met. She was really forward and sexually agressive in her communication with me. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward to our date, and the first moments go exactly as I had been dreaming about those previous weeks. We're really into each other and started making out, and that's when I noticed she had a penis. I stopped everything and I asked her ""so you're trans?!"", and she basically said that we had such a special connection, she was afraid of telling me earlier because she didn't want to ruin things and that since I am bisexual, she assumed I wouldn't mind. 

&#x200B;

I was instantly floored. Despite being bisexual, I am not sexually attracted by transwomen at all. It has nothing to do with not viewing them as real women, but there's something about the idea of a woman with a dick that's just offputting for me and it's totally not my thing. I then instantly made some distance between us, I was respectful to her at all times but I told her I needed to go home and process all this information before I could truly have any reaction. On my drive home I started getting really mad - if we hadn't been sexting, it wouldn't have been that big of a deal, she doesn't owe me anything. But the fact that we were obviously going to fuck, how could she hide something like that from me and not give me the right to know beforehand? I feel really stupid for having constructed this fairy tale in my head for 2 whole weeks because she didn't bother to tell me this obviously relevant fact. It was a terrible feeling, and to be honest, I'm still really fucking crushed about it. 

&#x200B;

I got home and texted her, thanking her for the date but that I was disappointed  and pissed she didn't tell me before and that it wasn't going to work out. She then proceeded to get angry with me, told me I was being irrational and transphobic and what not. So tell me reddit, AITA?

44,chdyb4,"AITA for being jealous of my sister getting therapy? Well,
I think I'm jealous. I've always felt that I want to be more social, but I can't. I never can get words to leave my mouth and it's difficult for me to be calm in social situations. I've missed out on so many opportunities because of this. My friends always claim that I have social anxiety. My family just teases me and says to ""Stop being chicken"", ""Don't be shy,"" and the most common, ""Man up."" I try, I really do. I want to talk to people but I really can't, it's hard. It makes me cry because I can't do anything without help. I've been struggling with this for so long. Everyone in my family knows about my social struggles, and I've tried asking them if I can get help. Their answer is always No.

Constantly making sure shes relaxed, calm and giving her time to recover. Even offering to pay for therapy for her. Something that I've yearned for, for forever.

45,dts1ef,"AITA - My life is being turned upside down by two toddlers My sister got pregnant as soon as she turned 18. She's a year younger than me & I knew immediately that it was a bad idea. Her boyfriend was a jerk & they fought constantly. A couple months after my nephew is born, my sister gets pregnant AGAIN.

Now I'm full-on panic mode because I know my drug/alcohol addicted sister & her BF could barely handle one baby, let alone two. But my mom is excited to be a Gma & got everything set up for my sister. Cribs, diapers, clothes, toys, you name it, my mom either bought it or got donations.

Now, something to know about me, I hate kids & it's only gotten worse over time.

Lots of drama later, I'm skipping a good 2 years here or this would be pages longer, my sister has been kicked out of our house & my mom ends up taking in my niece & nephew because my sister was neglecting them. They're 1 & 2 at this point, and my disabled mother is spending all her waking (and sleeping) hours to take care of them & get them set up in foster care so we can at least have financial support for them. Oh yeah, and I'm working full time to support two extra mouths. They've been here for 6-7 months when my mom promised at the time they'd only be staying for the weekend...  even at the time I had flat-out refused to let them stay.

But my mom can't turn away her grandchildren & she doesn't trust their father not to take them to Mexico to spite my sister. She loves them to no end & doesn't want them to end up in the foster care system. I can understand her reasoning, and see it from her perspective, but I only wish she'd never gotten attached to them, listened to my concerns before they were born. But what do I know.

Every day it's noise, messes, my house is an absolute disaster & I'm working 40+ hours a week while trying to get my business off the ground in my few hours of free time every day & trying to save up enough to move out of this personal nightmare. My mom's health has declined dramatically (it wasn't stellar to begin with) and I'm constantly worried this stress is taking years off her life. Not only that, the CPS system her is a fricking joke. Not once have I been talked to in private about this situation & my concerns.

My mom thinks I'm selfish for not wanting to live with emotionally traumatized, loud, messy toddlers & is constantly guilt tripping me for trying to save up enough to move out. I've fought too hard to overcome my clinical depression to get stuck in this situation. 

I'm taking promotions & working overtime in this job that I don't care about just to save up enough money to leave, but since I'm the breadwinner of the household, my mom's constantly reminding me that she'll lose the house & won't be able to support herself when I'm gone.

I rarely leave my room when I'm at home, I've gained weight, & my depression is starting to return.

2. A backlog of windows updates that needed to be deployed like...last year

47,ducv52,"AITA for not promising to pay the family phone bill when I graduate? I (26F) just got off the phone with my mother and she acted like I was being really awful, so I’m looking for some second opinions.

Some background: my parents are well off. My mother is an exec and has been making close to half a million dollars a year. I was lucky enough to graduate from college with no debt in part because they were able to pay the remainder after a generous scholarship + my graduating early. Then I worked for a few years, off of their payroll, but they’ve always been generous with gifts. For example, they’ve still invited me and my brother (22M) on family vacations and they helped me with a down payment on my first apartment.

I'm in my second year at law school, and at the onset my mother generously offered to cover whatever I couldn’t. Well, it turns out law school was a good investment in this case—I’m at the top of my class, and landed a summer associateship next year at one of the top firms in the country. The pay from that summer will fully cover my last year’s tuition, and these kinds of internships often result in an offer at market rate after graduation.

Our family is close, and I’ve always told my mother that I would be happy to do for her + my dad in retirement what she did for me + my brother if I could afford it. But she’s also planned very well for retirement, so there’s never been any expectation that they couldn’t cover their own bills.

Well, out of the blue today while we were on the phone my mom told me that she thinks I should cover the “family” cell account when I’ve graduated. The plan would include parents, my brother (graduating from a prestigious college with an engineering degree this year), and me. I expressed confusion because I figured me + bro would be splitting off after graduation. She kept pushing and making excuses about how it would be “cheaper” to all be together (but it definitely wouldn’t be cheaper for me to cover a $400 plan). I wouldn’t fold. I reiterated to her that I would be trying to restore my savings account and budgeting once I started working since I will have depleted my savings completely and basically earned negative income for three years. Then she started pulling out all of the things she’s paid for in the past and asking when I would pay her back for those, if I wouldn’t “even” cover their phone bill. 

It’s not that I wouldn’t try to cover them if they were in actual financial danger (I told her that), but I don’t want her or anyone else to be planning to spend a salary that I’m not even making yet literally over a year in advance. 

But she sounded so legitimately hurt, like I was just throwing her and my father to the wolves and being ungrateful for what they’ve done for me. I know my life has been MONUMENTALLY easier because of their help. But I’ve been taught to make good financial choices, and it seems like a really dumb one to promise to spend money that I don’t have on someone who makes more than 99% of the country. 

AITA? Should I have just agreed to help?

EDIT: Trying to stay under 3000 characters made this more confusing. First: I haven't lived in the family home since I was 21. I paid my own bills from 21-25. Second: Mother's original arrangement was to put me on family payroll while I'm in law school but deplete my savings + let me contribute as much as possible with summer jobs, then come back off the phone plan (and all of the ""shared"" family accounts) and pay for myself completely once I graduate."
48,eemvu8,"AITA for throwing out a dish that my mom specifically made for me? I live pretty close to my parents, not by choice. I’m of Indian origin and as anyone with brown parents will tell you, it’s pretty hard to do your own thing and maintain family ties at the same time... I love them, but they wouldn’t hear of me moving away and out of respect I stayed close by. Even that they didn’t want me moving out and buying my own place but tbh I’d go nuts if I lived with my parents. 

Background on me- I’m trying to slowly get on the dating scene after being a socially awkward pudgy loner for most of my 20’s. I wasn’t allowed a social life with my Hindu ex pat parents and when I hit 29, I decided enough was enough and started to go to the gym, and frankly I’ve never felt better and my confidence is at an all time high. I’m 32 now and look okay, but I have a real problem with food so I need to be strict to keep my cravings at bay. It’s a work in progress.

My Indian mom insists on sending me home cooked foods laden with ghee and fried onion and yoghurt, with homemade rotis (bread) so basically none of this is okay for my diet. She doesn’t believe in dieting and tells me lovingly that I need to fatten up. Part of moving out was me respecting my own boundaries because Asian parents just don’t listen. 

Because Christmas is huge in our household my mom sent my younger bro over to my place with fried bhajias (kind of like spiced onion and potato deep fried in batter) despite me telling her on the phone I didn’t want them. 

She sent them anyway. 

Now it’s one of my favorite foods so temptation is very strong to eat them. When they got to my home they were still hot and the paper towels were stained with grease... delicious. However I knew I couldn’t just have one, I would eat all of them so I threw them straight in the trash. I would ask my neighbors if they want them but I know that 1 neighbor is GF and 1 neighbor can’t handle spicy food so sadly they went in the bin. 

Now a couple hours later my mom came to my place because she wanted to use my fridge to store extra Xmas food, we have like 100 fam members coming to her place on Xmas and since I’m nearby she wants to use my fridge space. She went to throw out some old crap I had in the fridge and she saw the paper plate in the trash. 

She legit started crying calling me ungrateful and that I have no appreciation, etc. I told her that I refused them on the phone and she still sent them over so what am I meant to do. I’m kinda frustrated because I was an overweight kid my entire life and an overweight teen too, because I didn’t get proper nutrition or food supervision and she doesn’t take me seriously when I said I don’t want something"
49,ahw3i9,"AITA for kicking a homeless guy off my porch in the snow Background: I'm an *extremely* paranoid person, and already had one dude break in while I was home a few years ago. I met that dude at the door with a gun, but it scared the crap out of me and made me pretty jumpy for years. I have cameras everywhere, and when I bought my house I specifically and **repeatedly** told my family I didn't want ANYONE outside of extremely close family to know where I lived. I did this, because my father is very nice and attracts clinger ons like nobodies business, and is constantly having to deal with druggy employees that are good people . . .just crazy ones that are homeless, car less, alcoholics that are constantly in and out of jail etc. I'm sure you know the type


Anyway, at about 1:15 A.M. today this dude shows up BLOWING up my doorbell, he rang it like 60 times in a minute and a half period. I saw him on the camera, and he had a little dog with him, so I assumed he was a neighbor or something thinking the dog was mine after finding a stray. 

Before I could get to the front door, he circled around the house and was at the back door. I grabbed a gun (kept  it concealed so he didn't know I had it) and met him at the back door to figure out WTF he was doing.  

It was some guy who worked for my father months and months ago, that I have only met ONCE. My father brought him by house one day for some stupid reason, so now the guy knows where I live. I was extremely leery when I met him the first time, he was pretty shifty, and of course, had to come in side for something and saw that I have big tv's everywhere and all kinds of fancy crap inside. 

He apparently *just got out of jail* today, and was walking across town to ""the house he's working on building"" to sleep, but there's snow on the ground so he was cold and wanted to ""warm up"" in my glassed in porch. I'm not heartless, despite already being EXTREMELY uncomfortable, so I said he could sit there for a bit and warm up, but he needed to head on. He was rambling some **serious** red flag raising nonsense about having to ""pawn some stuff for groceries"" and how everyone he knew robbed him and wronged him,  and how several including his own mother apparently pulled guns on him, and he reeked of alcohol as soon I opened the door. 


An hour and a half later I saw he still hadn't left, so I went out and he was out there watching TV using a space heater I kept out there. I told him again he was going to have to move on, and made him think my mother was in the house getting nervous about him being there and was going to call the cops. 

30 minutes later, I was about to go out and tell him to leave or I was calling the cops,  when I finally saw him leaving. This was at 3, so he was there almost 2 freaking hours. I live alone and don't want random homeless people showing up in the middle of the night. I feel bad for him and his puppy, but come on! This is precisely why I try so hard not to let anyone know where I live. Now I won't be able to sleep the rest of the night because I have to watch the cameras and make sure he's actually gone. I realized after I saw him, that he was the same guy I called the cops on a few months back, because I saw him on the cameras messing around in my yard. I went out last time too, to see who it was but he was already gone by the time I got outside, so I let the cops know a dude was acting funky in the neighborhood. That was already pretty weird, but after a few days I just assumed it was some vagrant passing through, or weird funky salesman or something. 

I feel terrible that I had to make him leave in the cold on a day with snow everywhere, AITA here? I feel like Scrooge. If it had been someone I knew like a friend or something, I would have let them sleep on the couch inside, or if it had even been some of my father's employees that I at least *know* I would have let them sleep in the glassed in porch with the heater. But he just raised *so* many red flags."
50,brvx0b,"AITA for wanting to let mother struggle alone in her work ? My mother is a great mother. She educated me and my brother very well. She worked hard, alongside my father, to make us live a great childhood. She was quite permissive but we didn't abuse it, and even after my parents separated, we stayed with her, and she did her best.


My brother left the home to work in another town, and so it was her and me. She always wanted to open a shop, and had a lot of ideas : decoration shop, pub, and so many more I can't even remember. And so she did.


She opened her shop 7 months ago. We're living in the apartment above it, and it is quite nice. Or it should be.


When the project started to get real, I was finishing my studies in computer science, and my internship lead me to a job that I can do at home! I started working around the time the shop opened and, at the time, it was clear : I have my job, from Monday to Friday, with hours to do. But she was alone in her project, and the beginning was going to be hard, because of all the paperwork. So I helped her.


And I continued. And she continued asking for help, more and more.
I asked her, why do I have to work more and more? I expected less and less, as she has less and less paperwork to do. I didn't get an answer and she stated that she wasn't expecting this from me. She thought I'd help her. And guilt-shamed me for thinking that I should help her less. This was 4 months ago.


Since then, it became worse. Even more help, I had to ask to change my week-end to be Sunday and Monday in order to be free to help her. I have to help her doing barbecue every Sunday afternoon for her clients. I have to buy what I'm going to cook the Saturday during my work hours. I have to help her around an hour everyday for little things, like checking if somebody enters while she's in the back rooms for a little while or even when she goes to the bathroom.


I want to help her, but it starts to be a bit too much, and I don't want a conversation like the last one. So I help and take this on myself. If I refuse, she guilt-shames me until I feel under enough pressure to accept, or she just reminds me all week that I refused to help her, and I feel bad about it.


But she DOES need help. She's with me in a project way too big for herself, and at the beginning, it was clear between us : I have work and I'm not her employee. She has almost no time for herself, and she struggles to keep up with her work, even with my help.


Now I want my life to get to the next step. I'm nearly 20, single and want to find someone, live in my apartment, and not feel pressured by someone to always be there to help.


But when I talk about it, and ask her how she'll do what I help her with, she just answers ""I'll find a way"", and looks sad. I can't just let her here. But I can't stand helping her everyday on a shop that I do not want to take care of.


So, AITA for wanting to letting my mother alone in this?"
51,cftzz9,"AITA for not willing to evenly split a check at a bachelorette dinner? I’m gonna see if I can explain this in most basic way possible. 

My brother is getting married to an amazing woman, and this weekend is the bachelorette weekend/party. We did a ton of tours at brewery’s, got lunch, I bought her coffee’s, food, drinks all weekend. 

A bridesmaid booked a dinner reservation a higher class restaurant. I wasn’t hungry because I made dinner a bunch of food at the house we were staying at and got a single beer and $5 side salad. 

The check comes up, they come the conclusion that each bridesmaid has to pitch in $56 plus tip. I threw down 25 and 2 of the bridesmaids called me cheap and shady cause of appetizers and shots. They all took shots, not me. They all got apps, I didn’t take one bite or order one. I put down money for half the brides dinner and her shot and drink, plus mine and tip. 

I’m in a party of 10 people and half of them are rolling their eyes and furious. But I purposely did not order these meals or drinks cause they’re all so pricey. Everyone’s dinner was maybe $30 cheapest. I still paid for the part of the brides things and bought everyone’s beers at every brewery we went too but now I feel like a cheap little b word."
52,blz9rs,"AITA for not wanting to be friends with my partner's ex-wife? I met my partner 13 years ago, when he was still with his ex (all parties now 31-33). I thought he was an interesting person but he was taken, case closed.

This New Year's I was back visiting and I was at a bit of a loose end, so I messaged him to see if either/both would be interested in a coffee. He showed up alone, as she'd walked out on him to be with someone else 6 months prior, and things just clicked between us. I met his whole family in the space of a week, including his 5 year old daughter (let's call her Alyssa), who is an absolute joy.

Two months later I came back to live and moved in with him. Yes, it was fast, but we're going strong. They share custody 50/50, and he pays her child support. I have worked hard to build a good relationship with the kid, spending hours playing, and reading bedtime stories.

His ex has ...not taken it well. She messaged me on facebook before I came back, trying to build a connection but said things like ""I hope you're a stronger woman than I am"". I ignored her messages (which I recognise was not ideal), but met up with her for coffee when I got back.

The ex started by worrying that the daughter would be negatively affected, and I agree that doing the right thing by Alyssa is super important. Initially we'd agreed that I would stay with his sister when he had Alyssa, but just before I returned, his sister's partner invited his own struggling colleague to stay with them for a bit, taking their spare room. The ex was upset that the plans changed. This I understand, but it soon came out that she was upset about me living in ""her"" house with ""her"" things.

When she walked out, he bought her out, she owns her own place now. If she's struggling to let go of this one I'm not going to rub her face in it, but it's not my problem. But she's had some serious mental health issues in the past and this, plus feeling that her place in her daughter's life is threatened, destabilised her. She's messaged him horrible things (""you're a fucking psychopath"") and literally screamed at him on the phone. He has been nothing but civil in return.

The three of us have met up for coffee a couple of times and I've tried to reassure her that I'm not trying to be Alyssa's mother. But my words are not enough.

She has met with my partner multiple times and made some pretty nasty comments about me. She's mentioned wanting to physically attack me and is now trying to paint me as some ""other woman"" who was just ""waiting in the wings"", even though she's the one who walked out (and is still with the guy she left my partner for).

She's reaching out now and calling me immature. But I don't want to be friends. Eventually I'd like to build a welcoming family but I'd rather stay away from her for now than say something I regret and won't be able to take back in future.

AITA?"
53,cqaujx,"AITA for asking my Mom not to take my kid to the water park? So my mom and mother-in-law take turns watching my 4 year old daughter throughout the week. This Monday my mom told my wife and me that she's taking our daughter to the local water park. It's a big water park, and my wife and I haven't been there since we were kids. We weren't comfortable with our daughter going there with our parents because of how big it is, and the fact that we're unfamiliar with it. It would be fine with us if my mom took her there some day after we've gone to see it and are more comfortable with it.

When I told my Mom this, she was livid. First she said that I'm forcing her to break her promise to my daughter. I told her that she should have asked us if she could take our daughter to the water park before telling our daughter that they were going to go, and made sure we were okay with it, and if she had done that she would have known how we felt about it and wouldn't have promised to her that they would go.

 She also said that this means we don't trust her, but I told her that of course we trust her, we let her take our daughter lots of places. It's not that we don't trust her, it's that we're not comfortable with the water park and we want to check it out first.

Anyway, now my mom is still watching our daughter when we're at work, but she's barely speaking to us, and she's clearly still really pissed a couple of days later.

ETA: I forgot to mention that another part of the reason I'm hesitant is that (A) my daughter is afraid of slides, and (B) my daughter is afraid of loud noises, and (C) there's a local rec center we've taken my daughter to where there's a big bucket that occasionally splashes water all over the place, and my daughter is *fucking terrified* of that. I told my mom that I wanted to see the place first to make sure there's nothing like that which would stress her out, and she said she ""knows how to handle"" my daughter's tantrums/meltdowns, and I should ""trust her judgement"" about whether there's anything there that will stress her out."
54,e8ep0g,"WIBTA for taking a friend to small claims for money owed? 

TLDR: a friend owes me money and when I asked her for it long after the agreed upon payment date, she ghosted me. So I’m considering taking her to small claims court but other friends think that’s an asshole move.

The long version:  A close friend of mine was trying to grow her business as a horse trainer by purchasing retired racehorses, putting some training on them and selling.

She bought a horse with me in mind as a surprise although I really wasn’t in the market. I ended up buying that horse from her at 4 times what she paid for it and she only put 6-8 rides on him. She also failed to mention that he had ulcers so I’ve spent another 3k on diagnostics and treatment. But it is what it is and I ended up with a great horse and helped her business.

A few months after I bought my horse, she found another prospect but didn’t have the cash to buy him and asked if I would. We discussed and came to the agreement that I’d give her the purchase money, she’d put 30 days on him, sell and pay me back.

That was Feb 2019. Expected turnaround for payment was March/April. 

In April, she filed for divorce and was busy selling her house and moving so wasn’t riding. I understood that time and money were very tight especially given she has kids so I didn’t push.

All summer she vacationed and partied like a 21YO. No riding. I inquired and she said it was “too hot to ride”.

In September I asked about when she was going to get him sold and she told me that her assistant really wanted the horse. Great! Let’s sell!  Only assistant doesn’t have much money and would I just “gift”. Fuck no. I didn’t get a deal on my horse, in fact I paid many times more! And this horse I bought to help her out. Not even asking to split profit. Just wanted the seed money back!  

Last month, she remarried her ex husband and moved again. Still has horse.

I’ve texted and messaged. She wrote back saying that I should be more understanding of their “family circumstances”. 

At this point, she isn’t responding to texts or calls. So I’m thinking about filing in small claims.  I have documentation of the agreement and I feel like I’ve been more than patient.

But....several other people I’ve discussed this with think it would be a total asshole move. She’s been through a lot, etc.

I really don’t want to be a jerk. I just want my money. I’m not wealthy. I keep about 3k in play for rescue, rehab, rehome activities for horses and dogs and friend knows this. I can’t help anyone else til I replenish the fund and I’ve had a lot of unexpected expenses with the horse I bought from her. So I’m just kind of pissed. And I need the money.

So...WIBTA if I took her to court?"
55,b32yv0,"AITA for Canceling my Dad's cell phone? In 2013 I agreed to add my Dad on to my cell phone plan because he had bad credit. The additional cost of the line was about $30 dollars so we agreed that at the beginning of each year he would pay me $360 for the year. In January of 2018, I told him that I no longer wanted him on my plan but he said he was too busy to deal with getting his own plan so I agreed to do it for one more year. Over the course of 2018, we had a falling out and our communication became limited to a few emails related to family matters (health of older relatives).

In December of 2018, I got a letter from the Social Security Administration saying that I owed them money. After some digging, I learned that SS payments had been made to him fraudulently on my behalf when I was very young (please don't consider this in the judgment of the phone issue). I was able to resolve the issue but I decided that I did not want to be connected to him on any accounts.

On Jan 1, 2019, I sent him an email saying that I wanted him to transfer his phone line to his own account and that I would give him until Jan 31 to do it. I called the phone company to give him all the permissions to go into any store and transfer the number.

A few days after Jan 31 he called me and was very angry that I had canceled his number. I referred him to the email and he said he never saw it.

In order to recover the number, I needed to reinstate it on my account and then give him permission to transfer it again. I agreed to do this and he agreed to move the number by the end of February.

After the number was reinstated my Dad had some medical issues. He was also traveling and he wanted to transfer the number to a different carrier that was only available where he lives and not where he currently was. So the end of February deadline turned into whenever he gets back home.

I just sent him an email saying that I will cancel the line on Mar 31 and if he wants the number he needs to transfer it before then. There is no negotiation.

I feel like a pushover at the same time that I feel like I should be considerate of his situation with his health. AITA?

Also, I did not grow up with him and he did (edit: didn't) ever support me financially."

57,e5jtxg,"AITA for wanting the ""homeless man"" in my basement to leave our house Ok guys - this whole scenario is happening right now. My husband thinks I am a complete ahole where I think I'm in the right. I'll try and keep this as simple and short as I can.

So my husband went to the bar on Saturday and met this man - who apparently asked him (and another friend of his) if they had a basement because he got kicked out of the place he was staying and was wondering if he could stay in one of their basements. Granted my husband has never met this man before. So he texts me while I was working and asked what he should do because he feels bad for this guy. 

We both have big hearts (like jeez) it's cold outside, we live in WI and this guy apparently had all of his belongings in his car. I said that if he didn't have anywhere to stay that night I didn't have a problem with him staying one night until he can figure out other arrangements. So ""Stan"" ""moves in"" - essentially brings his entire carload of stuff into our basement and then when i started talking to him he was basically asking if he could rent out our basement. This wasn't what I signed up for.

Basically, I've been avoiding my house since Saturday and last night I lost it on my husband and basically said it wasn't fair that all of a sudden I have this strange man living in my basement. We didn't know his situation, why he was homeless, why the other people kicked him out, what his last name was etc. My husband understood where I was coming from and then apologized to me for putting me in this position. I then said that he needs to find a new place to stay sooner than later - by Christmas at the VERY LATEST and it will be my husbands job to tell Stan this. 

I got up this morning and went to work feeling ok since we talked about this last night. My husband had the day off, so then about an hour ago I get a text from my husband saying that Stan is leaving today - and my husband basically blamed it all on me because I wasn't happy about the whole situation. Stan apparently was crying and was really upset (rightfully so) and of course my husband needed to tell me that.

58,ata25i,"AITA for reminding my mum she told me she hates me So this literally just happened and I need to know if I'm in the wrong. A few days ago my mum was incredibly drunk and for no reason in a bad mood, she gets drunk like this a few times a week (she has a substance abuse problem) but she usually doesn't really bother me. She was going on about something stupid when she started banging something, I was trying to sleep so I open my bedroom door and told her to shut up, apparently that was enough to solicit a bombardment of harassment with lines like ""I hate you why don't you move out if it's so bad honestly"" ""I want nothing more than for you to leave"" ""both you and your brother can get lost for all I care"" and that's just the tip of the iceberg. She shouted some more and then went to bed, in the morning she came in my room and apologised and said she was drunk and the usual stuff she told me after nights like that, I just said I was fine and then I didn't care and it didn't matter because at this point nothing fazes me and I understand she has her own problems that she takes out on me. 

So today she was ranting on about how I borrowed some makeup and that turned into her just ranting about me in general, I get it I'm not the best daughter in the world. I just wanted her to leave me alone, I was feeling really sick and just wanted to sleep but she muttered something under her breath as she left and it really ticked me off so I said ""just like the time you said you hated me"" this did not please her and she said if I was going to hold her accountable for when she was drunk than that wasn't fair. She's been annoyed with me for a few hours now, so am I in the right or wrong?"
59,ekhvt5,"AITA for asking a guy in the parking structure to back up a little? New account bc I only ever lurked and somehow it got locked. 

I live in a high rise apartment complex with an underground parking garage that’s kind of poorly designed. There’s not room for two cars to go the opposite direction around any corners at the same time. It’s not a huge deal, people are generally pretty good about yielding to whoever was there first or whoever is in the better position to complete the corner so the other person can pass. 

I came up to such a corner yesterday right at the same time as a guy in a huge Jeep. He didn’t seem to want to stop for me so we ended up where I was halfway around the turn and he was right up close to me. He could not move until I did. He was in a long straightaway and had plenty of room to back up, but since I was coming around the corner I was kind of stuck and backing up would do me no good. I sort of gestured for him to back up and when he didn’t do anything I rolled down my window and called out “hey, can you back up, I can’t get through.”  

He rolled his window down and yelled back that I had room and he wouldn’t back up. I told him I didn’t think I did, could he just back up like two feet so I could pass? He kept yelling that I had room and refused to back up. So finally I was like, look I’m in no hurry, I can wait here all day until you back up. We both sat there for a few minutes until another car came up behind me being driven by a valet (there’s valet parking for visitors since it’s an assigned space garage). He got out to see what was going on so I told him the issue and he got out and looked carefully at the angles and was like I think you probably have room. 

I was literally within inches of hitting this guy’s car. I’m not exaggerating. The valet had to slowly guide me forward so I also didn’t hit the wall. So yes, technically I did have room but it required slow and careful maneuvering, nearly hitting his car, which would have been totally unnecessary if he’d backed up. 

I’m really perplexed about this guy’s actions. It just seemed completely unnecessarily rude. It wasn’t like I’d asked him to get out and push his car or something, and I was very polite about it until he started yelling at me. It would have literally taken two seconds for him to back up a couple feet so I’d have plenty of room without having to be worried about hitting anything. If the situation was reversed and I was in his car’s spot, I would have had no problem backing up. In fact I don’t think I’d even have to be asked if the other person was stopped and clearly didn’t think they’d have room to get through, I would just back up on my own to give them space (I’m pretty sure I’ve even done this at some point in the years I’ve lived here). 

I’m a woman, don’t know if that made any difference about his attitude. But on the other hand I did technically have enough room to carefully and slowly maneuver through even though it made me really uncomfortable. So AITA?"
60,cansu8,"AITA for not wanting a photo of a dead baby at my wedding? Context

At our wedding we're having a table to commemorate relatives who have passed who would otherwise have attended. Last year my fiancée's cousin miscarried, and we were happy to include the baby on said table, as it would have been born by our wedding date and would have been in attendance.
The problem is they want to have a photo of the baby's face, post-stillbirth, as the tribute. Not only do we think it's a pretty shocking and upsetting picture to have on display at a wedding, but we have two pregnant women in attendance at our wedding, one of whome also miscarried very recently.
We're happy to accommodate other options, but we're worried they might not be happy with us for refusing their wish.

Edit: Thanks for the feedback so far. Seems like most people are on our side, but I feel like a few people might have misinterpreted what the commemorative table is, as if we're having a fully set dining table with empty seats. It's simply going to be a small feature table in its own space, which people can visit if they choose."

Since I'm known in my family for being frugal and creative, she asked for me to help with planning and decorating. I agreed. My one caveat was not to wait until the last minute to try to get things done. I have a family, a son with learning disabilities, a job, and rheumatoid arthritis, so scrambling at the last minute would not work for me. She agreed.

Everything was going smoothly at first. Then she started to taper off and no show on days we were supposed to get together to work on bouquets, decorations, etc.

The wedding is now less than 3 months away. My RA has been flaring like crazy and I'm exhausted. I've been trying to help my son with his school stuff.

I don’t want that with him because although we are internet buddies, he sees me in like a greater light than I do of him. He’s told me I mean so much to him and that not meeting with me would ruin his trip to my country.

I already told him not to tell me that because I feel genuinely bad, but he been guilt tripping me by saying that’s what he means and he’s not going to lie about it. Like if I tell you that saying something like that hurts me, would a normal person continue to repeat it??  I think it’s because I honestly don’t think I want to be friends with him anymore. We don’t even share any common interests. I think he’s fallen prey to the halo effect and only likes me because I am good looking in his eyes since my personality really isn’t all that. I don’t know. I just don’t know what to do anymore. 

Update: he’s basically told me he planned this trip just to meet up with me and now that I’m officially not doing it, he’s not going to come because he’ll only be thinking about me. Fml what kind of mess did I get myself into just by being friends with someone? I’m only 17 ffs "
63,ajihjz,"AITA for not caring/doing anything for my coworkers birthday because no one at my job did anything for mine? Backstory: I've worked at my hotel for about a year and half, a year of it as the Front Desk Supervisor. Its rather small hotel so every department (Managers, Front Desk, Housekeeping, Maintenance) all know each other and get along for the most part. My work does a lot for employee appreciation things like monthly lunches and giving kudos to those who work hard. Usually when we know its someones birthday, we get a card and have everyone sign it and maybe even a cake if its someone who has been there awhile/is in a management position. 

When I say we, I mostly mean me because I am the one who keeps track of employee birthdays and organizes the getting the card and such. 

My birthday was a week ago today and I know that my coworkers/managers knew it was my birthday because I had requested off the weekend after to do something for it and I had some coworkers ask if I could work a certain day that I had already requested off. 

So the Monday before my birthday, I told myself I wasn't going to say anything to anyone all week about my birthday because I wanted to see if anyone would remember and at least get a card like I always do for everyone else. 

They didn't. 

Come Thursday (my birthday), I'm at work and everything is normal; no Happy Birthdays or anything. My manger, who is one of the nicest people in the world and I considered an actually friend, doesn't even say anything. He even asked me if I could cover the audit shift (11pm-7am) because he didn't schedule someone to cover the auditors request off. 

When I tell him no, I can't do it, I could tell he was kind of annoyed and asked ""Well why not?""

""Because its my birthday and I had it requested off for over a month""

Him- ""........OH SHIT, yeah its your birthday!....uh well...when you come in on Monday we'll have something for you!!"" 

&#x200B;

So I left work that day not really upset, just kind of like let down. But I told myself they would make it right on Monday and I'd at least get a card. 

&#x200B;

Monday of this week comes and nothing.

 Literally nothing. 

Not even a ""how was your birthday weekend?!"" -\_-

&#x200B;

I wouldn't say I was hurt, but definitely disappointed because I usually make a big deal about other employee's birthdays and just wanted them to do the same for me.

Then its Wednesday, which is the Housekeeping Supervisors birthday. Now I did know it was her birthday but I honestly forgot about it. 

But when my manager comes to me and is like ""I forgot its so and so's birthday today, can you get a card and cake from the store?"" 

I just looked at him and flat out said ""No, I'm not doing that."" And he, again, looks at me all annoyed and just walks away. Now the housekeeper supervisor told my manger today that she was upset we didn't do anything for her and he kind of put the blame on me for that....

64,bs6s8r,"AITA for expecting my husband to find a new job? 10 years ago, I moved hundreds of miles, from the rural North to the suburban deep South to be with my now husband. The first time I visited, I hated it. I was open about feeling I could not be happy here. I told him that I couldn't live the rest of my life here. He begged me to give it one year, then we could look at moving away. So I did, and I still hated it. I gave it a bonus year, and I really tried - tried to meet people, to experience the nearby city and natural areas, etc. I still hated it. 

He began saying that I would have to help him find a job because I was the one who wanted to move, and he couldn't support our growing family with no job. Well, that's fair. He has a restrictive NDA at work, so my knowledge of what to look for was limited, but I tried. I didn't find much, particularly in areas with lower COL, but I sent him a lot of listings. I also helped update his resume. One he applied to, the rest, no. Never heard back on the only application.

Fast forward to now. Our family suffered a severely traumatic event last year. At the time, we agreed that we had to make moving away priority number one. The children and I all have extremely high anxiety and my shrink and their therapist all agree that it would be wise to relocate. Everything else aside - how much I hate it, how bad the schools are - everyone is miserable and we do not feel safe here. I thought we were still on the same page and expected him to be working on the job end of things (in case a requested transfer didn't work out, which so far it has not).

Unlike 10 years ago, we now have four kids, a mess of pets, I work part time from home, and I'm starting to prepare the house for sale - or so I thought. But now he's falling back on saying I need to be the one to find him a job. Because he works all day. And I'm the one that wants to move. Therefore, it's my responsibility. 

So, Reddit, AITA? Yes, I was the one who originally wanted to move, and I always made my stance clear. I gave this place a fair shake. I could still see reason in me helping (well, doing all of it) with the job search, but this isn't just about me anymore. He works all day, but I'm not doing nothing. My days start at 6 and end at midnight, he works a 9 to 5. It's a stressful 9 to 5, but if I'm trying to handle all the moving logistic and house prep - am I out of line to expect him to start looking for other jobs? 

(Also I know it may be addressed - he has no real emotional connection here. He's a fan of the familiar amd has been here for 20 years, but doesn't have close friends, and is estranged from his abusive mom and rarely talks to his sister who live locally. I feel this may be a breaking point, but I don't want to die on a hill and ultimately end up moving away without him when I'm in the wrong.)"

After eating and watching a movie we played truth or dare. It was a girl who'll we will call Alissa who technically started it. It was her turn and she asked a friend. Let's call him Tom to take Disney  (A 5 week old black and white kitten) and put the kittens face in their ass. I opposed this but didn't say anything. I didn't know Tom would comply. But he did. He grab the kitten and pulled down his pants. He put the cats face on his bare ass and  farted. (The friend who invited us over was at the store right now getting snacks) Everyone was laughing but I was honestly disgusted. I started yelling at him. ""WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT? IT'S A KITTEN."" I then punched him. We started pushing and punching eachother until he pushed me really hard. I fell on something. It was a small 2 week year old. We took the kitten to the vet and it died. I feel awful and lost many friends that day. It's a silly ordeal and I just get frustrated thinking about it. Am I the asshole?"
66,amit9l,"AITA for kicking my roommate? For some context: 

We live in a dorm, and in my country dorms are really small. It's a tiny room, big enough to only fit 3 beds, 3 desks, a wardrobe and a fridge. My roommate's desk is right in front of my bed.

So I was sitting on my bed, chilling and watching youtube when suddenly my roommate turns around from his desk and grabs my leg. Naturally, I panic, kick him a few times and say 'fu*k off'. 

Now he doesn't talk to me and wants me to apoligise since I acted like 'an aggressive retard' and that he only wanted to showcase some leglock wrestling move or something.

Am I the asshole for reacting like this?"
67,emlqic,"AITA for taking my extension cord back So I live in a cold city in Canada where at certain temperatures you have to plug your car in at night so it starts the next morning.

There are two plug ins so side by side parking spots each have a plug in and I do what most do which is leave my extension cord plugged into the one closest to mine even when I am not there, but wrap it around the post so its out of the way.

I come back after having an emergency family babysitting call to find that not only had this person parked into a spot that I am pretty sure is not his (the spot hasn’t been used in months because the person who is supposed to have it has a huge truck that won’t fit) and was almost into my (tiny) spot, but was using my extension cord. On top of that, they had plugged in their own extension cord that was extremely knotted but did not use it.

I was already pissed because I had to try and manoeuvre my bigger vehicle into an even smaller spot with little space to get my fat ass out of and nearly got stuck because of the large amount of snow that has not been cleared from our parking lot. 
I went and unplugged the cord out of their car and plugged it into mine.

I am not asking if I am an asshole for that, because I feel like I am in the right taking my stuff back, but  I am wondering if IATA for not plugging in their car with the knotted up cord and possibly risking their car not starting as it is supposed to be cold tonight?

Edit: I don’t know if this makes a difference but looking back, it looked like my extension cord was longer than his, so maybe it couldn’t reach his vehicle. It also wouldn’t have reached mine either if that was the case. Can’t confirm as I really do not want to go back outside, but I’ll let you decide if that’s relevant for judgement"
68,at21ct,"AITA for thinking my SO eats out too much Hi Reddit. I’m on my mobile, this is a throw away, yadda yadda yadda. 

Am I (23f) the asshole because I think my boyfriend (25m) should eat healthier? He’s constantly ordering in food, picking up food, going through drive thru’s as well as going to  restaurants whenever he wants something to eat. He NEVER eats at home, even when we have food in the fridge/cupboard, he would much rather order food in or go get it. 

About a month ago I suggested that we try doing meal prep and exercising as our new year resolution. He seemed to think this was the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever suggested. He said that he doesn’t need to exercise because he isn’t overweight. Which is true. He isn’t in shape, but he also isn’t obese by any means. 

I respected his decision and started working out and eating healthy alone. I’ve been going to the gym 5-6 times a week, after I usually come home and make myself something healthy to eat. He always says no when I offer to make him something too (obviously) and orders in something he’d prefer. Lately, however, he’s been asking if I can pick him up something on the way home from the gym. His suggestions are usually fast food which irritates me a lot, because now I have to wait to make something healthy for myself even though I’m hungry. I’ve expressed this to him and he casually laughs and says ‘don’t get me anything then’. Okay fine. 

Anyways, today I went to the gym and worked out for about 1 1/2 hours. As I was leaving I stopped at a smoothie bowl place to grab something healthy to enjoy until I headed to work later. My boyfriend was so mad that I didn’t offer to go somewhere ELSE for him as I got “take out” for myself. As a reply I said ‘well you don’t seem to like healthy things lately and I don’t wish to support that habit.’ And he got in his car and left our house. 

Help me out, am I the asshole? "
69,e6u28z,"AITA for being uncomfortable with my boyfriends jokes? My bf is not the asshole but I want to know if I'm being unreasonable.

My bf (25m) casually brought up a couple ""jokes"" him and his friends like to tell. I say it in quotes because I don't really see how they're funny. He didn't think of them he just shares them and says he doesn't believe in it and they're just funny things. 

1.) A ""well-known"" maneuver among men where they spit on a girl's butt during doggy style so she thinks they came, then when she turns around they can trick her and come on her face.

2.) another maneuver where the man flicks his come in her face and eyes

3.) where the man says another woman's name and then ""holds on for as long as he can"" while she gets mad and struggles to escape. I think the idea is to get to completion before she can escape.

These made me uncomfortable and I don't really want him touching me for a bit, he's very mad at me now for bringing down the mood.

Am I being an asshole?

70,cnuze2,"AITA for telling my sister I would struggle to support her. so my sister 22f is a trans female, so she still has a penis. 

she likes to go out and sleep with people and do one night stands, my issue is that she will omit the fact that she has a penis until she is in her underwear just about to have sex. 
she had been kicked out of so many homes and one dude told her to fuck off and got pretty mad. 

I've tried to tell her that people can react worse then that and i don't wanna see her on the list of trans people who have died but she always shrugs me off. 

I know that there will be that one person who will get so mad he or she might do something bad to my sister, but my sister seems to not care. 

so I told her that If something was to happen I would struggle to feel sorry for her as she knows the risks but does not care, she took that pretty badly and my whole family now hate me over the comment.

I now feel bad because what if they really are just busy? Idk ."
72,b7s1be,"AITA for not inviting a friend when I hung out with another friend group? This happened a long time ago in college, but I've been thinking about it lately.

I changed high schools junior year and met a friend senior year (let's call her Ann) that ended up going to the same college as me. Before that, I had gone to a small K-12 (we'll call it Nerd Academy) where most of us had been there since the beginning, so we were really close. Quite a few of my friends from that school ended up going to the same college as well.

I spent most of my time with Ann, but I would still get together with my friends from Nerd Academy, especially on the weekends. This seemed to piss Ann off that I didn't invite her to hang out with us. She had met some of them in passing, but nothing more. Nerd Academy get togethers overwhelmingly involved a lot of inside jokes from our time at that school, and I don't think Ann would have enjoyed being a part of them and I honestly didn't want to be spending time during them explaining everything to her so that she would understand what we were talking about.

Ann didn't have a friend group that I didn't also know, so there wasn't really a similar situation on her side to compare to. Our friendship mutually ended after about a year for a lot of other reasons, but the fact that I was hanging out with other people without her was one of her main grievances. 

I understand that I could have made a greater effort to include her and let her decide for herself if she felt comfortable with that friend group, but some other incidents generally made me feel like she was just jealous and controlling. One such event was a Saturday morning where I told her I would go to this class at the community center with her so she wouldn't be alone but changed my mind maybe 3 minutes later because I realized I had an assignment due. She went anyway and I invited a mutual friend of ours over to my place to study. The friend posted something on Snapchat that indicated she had been over at my place, and Ann saw it and flipped a shit at me for ""bailing on her to hang out with someone else"" even though I explained to her that we were just studying together and had hardly spent 15 minutes of 4 hours goofing off.

So, what do you think? Was I being insensitive and excluding her? I've never taken issue with friends of mine hanging out with friend groups that I don't know and not inviting me but I don't want this to happen to another friendship if it turns out most people feel differently."
73,bnqm59,"AITA for letting my hickey stand out? I’m 17, ready to go to college purse my career, ready to make lifelong decisions. My mother, ever since I was little made me study hard. I don’t blame her for that but it also impeded on my ability to make friends. I was never an easy child i’ll admit. But i’d never been able to make friends easily. I’d be sitting at the dining room table studying or doing homework until i was “finished” which could take until 12 in the morning. With a mother that screamed at me for not knowing how to complete my math work. With a mother that threw me against everything in the house. I couldn’t lean on anybody for help because I had no friends. I was ashamed of who I was from the time I went to grade school. But when I thought of bringing my, now, friends over I always stopped myself and thought, what would happen after. Would she be disappointed in me in the fact that I wasn’t studying? 

I’ve been admitted to college in April. and since then I’ve made a conscious effort to spend more time with friends and to be more social than I ever have been. So yesterday, a Saturday, I invited my girlfriend over so we could hang out and since we’re somewhat long distance I don’t get to see her a lot. So, when we do see each other we do our fair share of indecent things. 

I got a hickey yesterday, and we both didn’t know because it was sorta dark outside and I thought. When we came down to eat dinner apparently my girlfriend noticed as well as the rest of my family. We had a pleasant dinner nothing crazy happened but when she left, oh boy all hell broke loose. My mom said that the hickey was EXTREMELY disrespectful. And to what I was disrespecting I have no clue. But i left it at that and went to my room.

This morning, which is mothers day, I wished her a happy mothers day and asked if I could do anything for her. She blew up on me. Saying that i’m a spoiled brat, that I should get a job and buy condoms and learn to be responsible. I didn’t deny any of that but I responded with was “there was no sex, no oral sex, only kissing. And I came down to see if you needed anything because it’s mothers day.”  We got into an argument. She doesn’t want me to bring her to the house anymore which puts me right back into the hole I was in when I was in grade school. I only get to see her once a week and it KILLS me that I only get to see her once a week, and now there’s one place we cant be checked off the list. 

Honestly I don’t know if I should blame myself for being so careless and letting the hickey slip out. Or be concerned that my mom is making me miserable. Like she had done years prior.

I should also add that my parents don’t have a great relationship. I’ve never really been able to look to them for guidance when it came to my relationship with my girlfriend rather than to take their bad experiences and tell her that we should really communicate with each other so we don’t go down the same road."
74,bn0902,"AITA for setting rules for hospital visitors after delivering our baby? We're due to have labor induced in the next few days (I'm the mother-to-be). This is our first child, and hubby and I decided that we don't want visitors while we're at the hospital or at home immediately thereafter. We want to spend time as just the three of us, baby getting to know us and vice-versa, before introducing new people to her. This restriction is for everyone, including our immediate families. Everyone else is fine with that, but...

My mother has taken offense at this and is badgering me that she just wants to come see her ""when she is brand new"" at the hospital and immediately go back home. She is the only one who doesn't accept about our restriction. Also, mom lives over 400 miles away, so no matter what she says, this wouldn't be just a quick pop-in visit. I've asked her to come spend a few days with us AFTER we get settled in. (Note: she's also scheduled herself to be unavailable to visit for all but 4 days during the 3.5ish weeks after our due date, which has been known for 8 months.) 

As additional background, I'm my mom's only child. She and dad divorced 2 years ago, so she kind of lost her step-grandchildren and step-great-grandchildren that were through my two half sisters. She keeps in touch with them through social media but I don't think she's seen any of them in person since the divorce.

I'm perfectly fine sending lots of photos to her, but that isn't enough for her.

AITA for standing my ground about having no one visit us at the hospital when our baby is born, up to and including the new grandmother?"
75,c9w4za,"AITA For asking for another nurse and wanting to change donation location I donated blood and the nurse, who has drawn my blood multiple times, decided to rush the injection.

There was no one waiting and nothing to watch on TV so there was no reason to rush. The needle was injected it missed the vein and she said I moved so I asked for the other nurse who just moved the needle around and found it. The rest of the donation process was fine. 

The nurse is the same person who changed my email address to the incorrect one so I can't use to to accept rewards anymore.

76,6ws7p6,"AITA for saying that the thought of having sex with another guy makes me uncomfortable? (Long) Okay, so this happened yesterday evening at my local pub. It was a public holiday here in the U.K. and a lot of people were out for the evening, more than usual on a Monday night. One of those was an old schoolfriend whom I haven't seen for a good 4 years. We'll call him James. We were never especially close, but got on pretty well. It was nice to see him and catch up, and since leaving school and going off to uni has come out openly as gay.

We were chatting about a variety of things, and he was talking about the gay scene at his uni and how he came to terms with his homosexuality and stuff, and it was really great to talk to him about relationships and stuff and most importantly to see how happy he was - in his last year at school he went through some personal issues, and while I'm not absolutely sure if it was anything to do with his sexuality, a lot of people even at the time suspected that was the case.

Both of us had had a few drinks, although he didn't seem openly drunk or anything. At one point he made a remark that it was a shame that I'm not gay because he gives really great head and thought I would enjoy it. I kind of laughed it off, it was fairly innocuous, plus I'd been talking to him about my girlfriend so he knew that I wasn't gay, though he may have wondered if I was bi. Evidently he was wondering, because he asked if I had ever considered experimenting with guys. My reply was that I had never given it any *serious* thought, mainly because the thought of actually being sexual with another guy makes me feel uncomfortable.

His response was, ""Wow, that's pretty homophobic."" To which I explained that, to my knowledge of the term, I'm not homophobic, merely that I myself would almost certainly find no enjoyment or pleasure from experimenting with a guy. After, I could tell he had gone a bit cold towards me, and after a minute or so he made his excuses and went to join his friends. About ten minutes later, a girl whom I've never met before - let's call her Katie - came over to me and started berating me in the middle of the pub for being, in her own words, ""violently homophobic"" towards James. After effectively being shouted at for a good five minutes by Katie, with me trying to get a word in edgeways to explain why I didn't feel I'd been homophobic, the landlord of the pub came over and said that if the shouting didn't stop we'd both be thrown out. In the end, I finished my drink and a friend and I went somewhere down the road to get away from the glowering stares we were getting.

This morning, I sent James a message via Facebook and apologised for any confusion or offence caused, but he saw it and hasn't replied. Normally something like this wouldn't get to me so much, but I consider myself to be a very open, inclusive and accepting person of all sexualities, genders, orientations and the like. Hell, I pride myself on it. I don't feel like what I said was wrong, but from both James and Katie's reactions it's obvious that they took offence.

Am I the asshole here?

So this is how it goes. I am a manager of a customer service department. We take a lot of unkind phone calls a day. I have this employee we will call him George. George is a single male in his mid 30s and has recently taken a 2nd job at a fast food restaurant. 

George refuses to get a roommate (He insists living alone because people suck, and I agree with that) But, has many unnecessary expenses. Including monthly passes to 3 different theme parks that range from 10-60 each.  George has recently started taking advantage of a friend of mines kindness and also mine. We sometimes will go out for a drink after work on Fridays or maybe grab something to eat and every time my friend or I always wind up paying. Not really a big deal I guess but, the thing that irks me is he doesn't offer to pay EVER. He has also recently started going over a friends house every week to do his laundry. This was okay the first week but, it's going on almost a month now. He just shows up or says I'm coming over to do my laundry. She ibeing the nice person she is she just allows it. 

George has started to get really rude with me (his boss) and a few other coworkers. I have asked what is wrong and all I get is i'm tired. He isn't giving our customers the normal customer service they deserve either. Which is really starting to effect the relationships with customers. I have done everything I can recently to try and cheer him up but, nothing is working. To be honest I'm just over it. I've started sending him home early every day because of his attitude. ( I never did this before but, I just can't handle the negativity. We already work in what can be a pretty negative environment, don't need to make it worse than it already is. )  He is up for review in the next week or so and I'm working on that but, I'm inclined to not give him a raise because of the attitude he's had. He chose to take the 2nd job. He has made these choices and i'm irritated with the way he's been acting.  So reddit- AITA for not giving him a raise and sending him home early? 

&#x200B;

TL;DR - Employee of mine isn't making enough money at his position went and got a 2nd job, is rude to other coworkers and employees because hes tired. I've been sending him home early and  I might not give him a raise because of the attitude he's been giving everyone."

80,b72w8f,"AITA For Wanting My Privacy From My Family? I've been lurking on this sub for a bit and seen other people's dilemmas, and decided finally post something of my own here. I'm on mobile, so sorry for bad formatting in advance.

So, throughout my entire life, my family has been the kind to snoop around. My mom found out that my dad was cheating through snooping, a lot of family drama occurs through snooping, so on. I hate the drama this creates, and as such, I just want my own privacy.

Onto the story. My entire life, my mom and dad snoop around on me. They want to know everything, my dad always asks if I'm being bullied or made fun of (to which I reply no, as I'm not and I don't want to start and false drama) and my mom always asks about my school life. ""How's your friends? How's your relationship life going? Why don't you talk with this person anymore?"" It bugs me so much, as this happens every day, and only escalates when family like my aunts and uncles visit. They ask the same questions, and I'm forced to repeat them over and over again.

This all came to a head one day after school, a few months ago. I had learned that my parents snooped through my room and found a journal of mine which I like to write stuff in about my life. They looked through it and began to question me on it, and I told them it was private. We stopped talking about it, and I thought that was the end of it.

The next day, I wake up early, and my mom demands my passcode to my phone. I tell her I have a right to privacy, as it was my phone and I had the right to have a private life. She told me as long as she pays my bills and keeps me fed, nothing can be kept private from her or my family. She then proceeded to take away my phone, telling me I can have it back when I give her the passcode. Her knowing my phone passcode has gotten me into trouble multiple times for conversations with my friends using 'inappropriate language' or my YouTube history.

I'm visiting family and I suddenly remembered this incident, and decided to post this here.

81,c3smht,"WIBTA if I left my family due to disagreements over life choices? Throwaway, long read but please bear with me.

After getting my media diploma, then serving my national service, I got a job as a videographer at 22. It’s almost a year since I started, and while the hours are long, I love my work, my colleagues are like a second family to me and pay is decent. 

My family on the other hand, want me to go to university. Where I come from, many people are expected to go to uni. Even though the trend is shifting, there are some traditional minded people who stick by this, and my family happen to be some of them. In fact, they only let me work for a year after I promised that I would head back to university when I felt I was ready. Thing is, getting into a uni media course is pretty tough here for some reason. I have tried for two years during national service to get in and failed. I have no interest in the other courses because they are unrelated to what I want, but my parents want me to get a uni degree just for the sake of it. I see no reason in wasting time and money for something that I have no interest in just for a degree that I would never use.

In my line of work, degrees are not prioritized, but rather the quality of your work and experience. I have talked to peers who have worked in this industry and they do agree that while degrees are helpful, they pointed out that they aren’t necessary(from what I heard), in fact some of them had unrelated degrees and realized they just wasted their time in uni.

I tried my best to reason with my parents that uni wasn’t cut out for me, that I loved my job and my colleagues, and I’m not throwing everything I built up on their whim. Their response was “you promised OP”, and “I’m right you’re wrong!”, despite my attempts. We quickly argue when the topic is brought up because they act rather stubborn and literally refuse to listen. I also find it disgusting that they care more about a ‘promise’ rather than the happiness of their son.

I applied this year for their sake, hoping for a chance of getting the course I wanted, but instead got something else. My parents, hearing that I still got into uni anyways, started talking about preparations. This angered me as they never bothered to ask me much about work, but never hesitated to ask me about uni preparations. They never gave encouragement or consolation that I have to give up everything I worked for. They would never be convinced. While I have a uni place, no fees have been paid yet and I am still allowed to reject it.

So I have started making preparations to move out on the sly, but I am hesitant to go ahead. They are my parents after all. While I will leave a message that I have left and am perfectly safe, I dont intend to contact them for some time and my sudden departure will cause a big upheaval. I strongly feel that I, not them, should decide what to do in my life, but I cannot bear to hurt them like this.

So, AITA?"
82,bqv8k5,"AITA for not going on a hiking trip with my husband? My husband of 7 yrs proposed a hiking trip this weekend. We haven't done such a trip in about a year, we were both excited. He was itching for a day trip and some natural vistas; I was more excited to just spend the day with him, since we have both been traveling for work a lot in the past few months. 

By mid-week, he starts mentioning that his self-described 'work wife' is looking forward to the hike as well. I'm like -- hold up, Why did you invite Agnes? They met in grad school 3 years ago, became friends, and now they both work at the same company on the same team. I patiently abide their close relationship because I trust my husband-- Agnes, less so. The bottom line on Agnes is that she has not had many healthy relationships with men, and gravitates to those who are unavailable. I implore my husband to set firm boundaries with Agnes, because I don't think she is mature enough (emotionally) to set them herself. My husband dismisses my concerns, and he is right that their relationship has improved since it things came to a head a few months ago. 

Inviting Agnes on what was supposed to be *our* hiking trip honestly made my heart sink. It felt like a regression in a state of affairs that had been improving. I admit my insecurities, and the situation is not improved by my husband constantly trying to get me and Agnes to be better friends. I keep telling him that it is totally inappropriate for him to want his wife to be friends with his girlfirend.  

I was hurt, and refused to go on this hiking trip if she was going too. I know it's petty, but I couldn't think of anything else to do, except roll over and accept that my husband is more concerned about disappointing Agnes with a disinvitation than about proving to me that he doesn't secretly want to fool around with her. In the end, my husband left me fuming at home while he spent the day alone with this woman. He maintains that I am the one causing an issue here, and again, I do kinda sympathize. But AITA for demonstrating that my husband can't have it both ways?

EDIT: I didn't go because I didn't want to compete with Agnes for my husband's attentions. My husband did try to get others to come on the trip as well, but none could make it. Agnes decided against inviting her ex-BF because it ""would seem too much like a double date,"" bitch IDGAF."
83,e213q2,"AITA for refusing to drive my brother to and from school? Myself (17M) and my younger brother (15M) attend the same high school, and when my parents aren't using a car, we get to drive my mum's car to school. My brother is a bit of an jerk and often makes fun of/bullies me for various factors i.e my weight, appearance, athletic skill (or lack thereof), personal interests etc. Typically accompanied with a salvo of name-calling. I've been driving since I've been allowed to get my license and have had to deal with this behaviour for nearly 2 years. 

I brought up his nasty behaviour to my parents told them why I don't want to drive him to school when he constantly harasses me and hasn't given me as much as a thank you since I've started driving him and they gave him a lecture, but he has seemed to take none of it to heart and has been acting the same as he used to without the slightest change. I usually turn the other cheek in this situation (I can have a bit of a temper and try my best to keep cool) but today I decided to stop tolerating that. After we arrived at school I told him I wasn't driving him home or to school until he stops his unsavoury behaviour. (I got a bit heated there and my time was a bit angry)

All I think I did was uphold my right to not be verbally harassed on a daily basis, but he thinks I'm being an irrational jerk and that it's his right for me to give him a ride to school.

84,ep7l0m,"WIBTA if I went to a party hosted by a girl my best friend hates? Some context. There is a girl (I’ll call her C) who I have many mutual friends with in my grade. She is friends with my boyfriend which will be more important later. My best friend (calling her J) cannot stand her. She bullied my best friend around the time of 8-9th grade which was almost four years ago. They haven’t had any problems since, and every time I’ve been at an event with C she’s never once mentioned anything about J. Knowing my friend, I know that she is really insecure and tends to suck up to everyone, and go far out of her way for attention. I think she’s just jealous all her friends are friends with C. Anyway, my boyfriend was initially invited to this party along with a bunch of his friends, and then C invited me. I’m not close with C, and if my boyfriend wasn’t going to this party I probably wouldn’t have been invited and wouldn’t have went. I personally think C is really nice, and I’m not the kind of person to hate someone just because my friend does. As far as I know they haven’t talked in years and there hasn’t been any bullying for even longer. J has this idea drilled in her head that everything C does is thought out to make her upset, such as hanging out with her friends and ex boyfriends. I think it’s just because we’re all part of a similar friend group. I doubt C is out to get J, considering I’ve never heard her mention her once. I was thinking of texting J and telling her I was invited to this party because my boyfriend is going. I didn’t want her to somehow find out I was at C’s house thinking we’re all buddy buddy now. Do I think J should get over her grudge she’s holding? Yes. But I also know she’d get upset if she were to find out and I’d feel guilty. Honestly, she will probably blow up on me either way but will going just make things worse?"
85,3wduqj,"AITA for quitting work after 4 shifts? I'll try to keep it short.

So two weeks ago I got a gas station cashier gig. I put flex hours (can work most times) but they needed me in graveyard - I was cool with it. 

So like two shifts in I'm already noticing there's a completely lack of professional behavior on both sides of the ball (customer service and employee relationships). It all started on our first night - my coworker made a, albeit consequential, mistake. One of the ""senior staffers"" (old fucks who have been cashiering at this gas station for years) took it upon herself to rip this poor girl a new one. The second night ended with me discovering a coworker photographed a simple mistake I made and ""reported"" my shit via messaging group: a group I'm not even in, mind you.

I decided to call my manager to speak to him about what I'd been seeing. He practically dodged me, forcing me to ask him things over the phone. Didn't go well.

It all culminated to the end of my 4th shift. The shift relieving me and my partner cannot open because there aren't enough dollar bills in the tills. So, while customers are lining up to pay for coffee this relief shift is, quite literally, thrashing about shifting blame onto me (I had no idea what I even did), which eventually ended with my manager coming in and saying the same thing.

I'd decided I wanted nothing to do with that store anymore, and quit after my shift. My manager got extremely defensive and said I was the first ""problem employee"" he's ever had: He said I shouldn't use baseless accusations (he wasn't yelling at me directly, just all of us in general!) to justify wanting to just quit. Yech

So am I the asshole here? Is this just the culture of gas station retail, and I should have had the stones to just stick it all out? Let me know~

**edit:** Thank you all for the responses! I guess I'm in the clear, then. Here's to better, non gas-station things in the future! haha."
86,b0fkwi,"AITA for not telling my in laws that we are selling our condo and full time RVing? A little back story, my (35 f)in laws are crazy. They were scary over protective of my wife (27 f) when she was growing up. In fact, even to this day she finds out just how “not normal” her family was when she sees how other families work.

Her parents are both alcoholics and smoke more weed than I can imagine... and my wife has gone through years of therapy to try to work through the insanity of her childhood. No physical abuse, but a shit ton of emotional and psychological abuse. Her parents would never go to therapy, but if they did we are both convinced her mom would officially be diagnosed as borderline.

He has an extremely clingy girlfriend and she overreacts all the time so he hasn’t told her that I hang out with him. I have my license just not a car so he takes me home Tuesdays and Thursday’s because our schedules match and sometimes we’ll go out to lunch or go to the mall before he takes me home.  Drake and I go to a college campus because we are part of a CCP program but she goes to a high school still so they don’t see each other as much as we see each other. I’ve found someone I click with really well before but that was his best friend and we don’t talk anymore and I never really talked to Drake until now.

His friend ended things on bad terms with me but I’m not that low and also I’m not looking for a relationship, I enjoy being independent and I just haven’t had any luck with relationships so I’d rather not. I’m not hanging with him because I have feelings for him or so I can attempt to piss off his friend, I genuinely enjoy his company as a person. I feel so shitty lately because I feel bad for Drake’s girlfriend because she doesn’t know about us hanging out or us FaceTiming but we never did anything, we just talk and he talks about his girl a lot.  Also, I feel bad that I might be hurting his friend and that’s not my intention, I’d gladly talk to him again if he would let me. So am I an asshole? And should I stop being friends with him?

88,di9w5l,"AITA for not supporting the asian family dynamic? I met this beautiful asian girl last year and we've been really enjoying our lives together so far. She is a wonderful human, very caring and loving, and extremely supportive of her family back home (3rd world country) and financially has been able to allow them to live quite comfortably, without jobs, in a nice house etc. Initially when we met, I was really taken aback by this, and used the juxtaposition with white western family dynamics to really view what I've been doing wrong with my own family all my life (specifically, giving zero fucks), and I really respect her for that.

Fast forward several months, and I'm learning that her finances are an absolute mess. She has around 50k in non-mortgage debt (car loan, 10k in credit cards, misc other debts) while working like 70 hours a week, poor thing is just practically unable to make ends meet despite earning 45-50k/yr on her own. She moves in with me, I agree to pay around 80% of the rent (I make a little more than her, but not by much, just have more financial freedom) and she gets some relief. 

Around a month ago, she discovered she needed braces, of course being the loving boyfriend I am, I offered to help her pay for the braces (everyone deserves to love their own appearance), but I added the stipulation that she needed to be more diligent about paying back her CC debt, which is a real black hole for a lot of the western world, and she needed to get that demon dealt with first priority. She agreed, and we made a plan to spend the next year paying down her debts, getting her teeth fixed, and then looking towards some college so she can advance her career a little bit. 

Her family however, also has needs. She has been back and forth trying to decide on a vehicle to buy them, which I advised should be a) cheap b) reliable c) not brand new so she can still meet her finances back home. Come to find out, she has been suckered into signing a 5-year loan for a brand new Nissan, spent nearly 2k on a vacation (and another 1k that I chipped in for her to go back home), and figures this is a reasonable spend. 

IMO, her family sees her as a cash cow, and they were extremely unsatisfied with options in vehicles that were 4-5 years older, they really wanted a brand new car, and waited for her to arrive back home so they could guilt trip her into signing for it. I'm pretty choked and I feel like my own financial future is being challenged by her shitty choices, but I'm also not sure that I even approve of the ""our daughter is abroad, of course we can afford X"" attitude. I basically sent her some love over SMS today and told her that I love her, but I'm really worried about her financial choices, and it's getting to me.

I'm half inclined to tell her I can't help with the rest of her finances if she is going to keep making extremely poor choices, I just don't want to send her that information while she's still on vacation but it's eating me up inside.

89,d98coi,"AITA for cutting a 10yrs friendship without telling the other person? Hi! So.

I've had a friend for 10yrs. One you meet like 2-3 times a week. Three years ago she had a severe depression. To the point of complete apathy. Didn't talk, didn't react.

It lasted 9 months. And I was beside her all the way. It was terrible and boring, but she was my friend. 2 years ago, she got better. Then she started destroying and breaking our friendship with all the A-hole move.

Claiming to be' home but going out with common acquaintances, being absent and unavaible in what was my wrost period of my life, back-stabbing, trying to embarass me publicy, outing me or simply reprimand me like a child. And I mean it in a ""Down! Down! Put the Glass down. It could break. OP. Down!"". We were in a pub. I had just finished my wine glass.

There are even more severe accidents. Or small frustating ones. The list would be' too long and the more I think about it, the more embarassed I feel about forgiving her, or just let them pass.

Everytime something happened, my go-to modus operandi is sending out a text with a ""We need to talk"" and talk it out. We've always found a solution/made up.

Last week something I found quiet serious happened. I don't want to get into it. But it truly hurt me. And it was in public.

But I don't want to go start the whole ""We need to talk"" process again. She's going to cry or blame someone else or depression and go over the whole ""forgive me, I love you"" bullshit you are supposed to get from abusive boyfriends and not female straight friends.

So I'm pretty much giving her the silent treatment. But like... forever. I feel like I went about this ""the mature and understanding way"" too many times. I just want to ignore her. If we met, I would only get angry. And I'm a little afraid I could get *too* angry.

People claim I have to tell her at least a *Fuck You* and ignoring her text about going out or quick coffees, will not make her see my reasons and why I'm angry and I'll just be the AH who walked out on her after 10 years of friendship.

I don't want to make her see my reasons. I just want her out of my life.

So... AITA?"
90,dzpc47,"AITA for not cooking my stepdad dinner and subsequently forcing my mum to do it? So I (m 17) really enjoy cooking; I’m currently in a really bad patch in my life with no job, no education, am suffering from depression and extreme social anxiety to the point where I almost never leave my house so learning how to make good tasting food has become one of the few things I genuinely find passion for. I’m happy to cook for my brother and mum. Not so much for my stepdad.

Long story short, he’s a prick. He always swears, always berates me and always finds something to complain about. I get that he had a shit childhood and works a lot, but when I say “hey” or “how’s it going?” and his immediate response is “shut up you fucking asshole” or “what the fuck are you doing” you don’t tend to get along very well. He says he’s joking but I’ve asked him multiple times to stop and he just starts on me for wanting to be treated like a normal person.

This has been going on for I can’t even remember how long and today happened to be one of those days I didn’t feel like being the only civil one any more. When he said his usual “what the fuck are you doing in my house” I told him all he does is treat me like shit and to speak to me properly. I was subsequently called a cunt and told to do something that I’d rather not type out. Lovely.

It only escalated from there and after I yelled at him for shoving the present I got for my nan in a cupboard he got right up in my face to scream at what a miserable coward I was, only just being held back by my mum. After saying he’d bite me like a dog(?) he stormed off to his bedroom and I carried on making food which I had already only planned to give my mum and brother.

You’re probably wondering how I’m the asshole at all. That’s because after my mum realised when I was dishing up that there was nothing for my stepdad, she started doing it all the while her food was going cold.

One of the reasons I cook is to make things easier on my mum since she works so hard as a teacher and usually comes in so late she doesn’t want to cook anything for herself. So now, because I didn’t want to do that pricks food for him my mum has to do it on top of all the other work she has to do. 

I know I didn’t mean to make her have to do it and it was her choice, but maybe if I’d just sucked it up and did my stepdads food anyway she wouldn’t not have time to relax after a long day. Things have been really hard on her lately for multiple reasons and I can’t help but feel selfish for adding more worries by butting heads over something that everyone says is just a harmless joke. And the fact that people say the clashes are just as much my fault makes me wonder if the stuff I say and do are just as much out of line as my stepdads.

But really, at the end of the day, there’s not much I can do about the situation so this is really just to know if I should do things I hate so that someone I care for doesn’t have to.

Mother has spent her whole life dealing with depression and so have I. She's been married 5 times. She spent the better part of my adolescence abusing me verbally, cursing my name which I share with my father, and ridiculing my existence. On several occasions she would wake me up at 5am to lecture me on how much of a loser I was. I'm not really comfortable sharing much more than that on here. My sister on the other hand in her eyes, is a perfect angel and couldn't do anything wrong. I get along with my sister very well.

I dropped out of high school because I would miss weeks at a time. I would crash on people's couches and sleep in my car (bought with the $5k  left from my Dad) and eventually got my GED and started working immediately. 

I'm now an adult and living with my girlfriend, in a mutually loving and supportive relationship. Both of us are full time students and both working part time. I have spent the last ten years in therapy trying to keep myself sane and have been taking many steps to improve my life, which has worked. I'm finally going somewhere.

Now that she's retired, she has begun to explore her own past and has realized how much *her* mother abused her. Despite many attempts, she refuses to acknowledge what she put me through, belittles me and pretends everything is okay. She recently discovered that she has ostioporosis and could get very hurt easily, but I haven't spoken to her in months. She keeps leaving me voicemail wondering how I'm doing and acting all nice. I don't care if she's sick, and I am sick of the guilt.

92,bd1ta3,"WIBTA If I (18/F) won't invite my father to my graduation ceramony My mom (42/F) and my dad (46/M) divorced when I was 6. The whole marriage and the separation was quite nasty so they haven't spoke for over 10 years. Both of their families hate one another.

My father was a horrible alcoholic and he was neglecting towards me and my little brother (17/M now) when we were really young. We went no contact for a few years but it got better. We visit him every months nowadays.

The thing is; he has never apologized for months of abandonment he done, his drunk tantrums, him hitting my mom and us so I stopped expecting an apology. Ive always had resentment for him and it got all worse when I got depressed this year and one of the reasons of my disease was my parents' actions to me when I was a kid.

My father got sober eventually but he developed a very unhealthy obsession with religion (islam). He forces me to wear baggy things and do my prayers when I'm around him. He also doesn't have any idea that I drink occasionally.

I'm graduating from a top tier high school this year. I bought a very revealing dress with both a cleveage on the chest and a slit on its skirt. My mother was okay with it. 

All my family from my mother's side are invited. I didn't invite anyone from my father's because:

1- my mom and dad are total enemies and they can't stand each other. So I'd have to go back and forth to their tables all night.

2-my father had no contribution to my education. My mom was the one who supported me both financially and figuratively while my father saw no point on me getting a high school diploma.

3-my dress is skimpy.

4-there will be an after party at the same venue when the ceremony is done. Parents will be asked to leave but I'm not sure my dad would leave. The after party will contain alcohol and he would be pissed if I ask permission to stay in such a bad environment.

My mom said she would be okay if he comes to the ceramony. I feel really guilty because I still love him no matter what and  it's his only daughters high school graduation but i decided not to invite him.

Now I have four younger siblings who are between the ages of 13 and 21, and the youngest of them really wanted the dog, and I'll admit he stepped up when we got it, but I ended up doing most of the cleaning up after the dog. This annoyed me and I felt I made it clear that I didn't want this to happen, but whatever I ended up falling in love with the dog so no big deal.

Well fast forward to this most recent Christmas and my Mom comes and tells me they plan on getting a new dog after a recent break in we had a couple months ago. Now I told her I honestly didn't want a new dog because I felt it would end being a repeat of last time, but that at the end of the that if everyone else wanted I'd be fine with it. Well was in for a surprise when she told me that my father was picking it up at that very moment and she was going to surprise everyone with it. I was a little annoyed but whatever I made her promise that I wouldn't be stuck taking cleaning up after it once everyone settled back in to school and I thought all was fine. So a few weeks go by and I've of course been helping take care of it here and there but then I started to notice that once again I was the one cleaning up after it and no one had started school yet.

94,8jyoju,"AITA for wanting my bass back even though I wanted to share it. Ok I will explain the situation in the form of points. Sorry for shit grammar and editing because I use reddit on mobile.

1. I own a Squier Jazz Bass and play it infrequently because I often get pain in my fretting hand. Also my practice amp is broken because of a short  circuit.

2. I'm currently in college and if you have guessed by now, the music club. I use the amp in the music room.

3. I decided to lend my bass to the music room just in case of anyone wanted to play it on two conditions:
It would remain in the music room (its always locked at the end of the day so I can keep an eye on it).
If you used the bass make sure you wipe it down and store it back in its gig bag.

4. There was a cultural fest a month ago and one of the music room members, whose a great bassist and has a band, asked me to borrow the bass for the entire week for the festival. I allowed him.

5. After repeated pleas, he hasn't returned the bass. He lives on campus (dorms) and I live off campus. He says it's in his room and I'm like dude just use it in the music room. Because when I wanna practice it's not in the room. I cannot go to his room and take the bass back because I'm a girl and I'm not allowed in the boys dormitories. Also he doesn't pick up his phone that often and is often outside campus.

6. Next Monday hopefully I will get it back and I'm planning to keep it with me always and only bring it campus if I'm playing it.

95,cup0tl,"AITA for not tipping a bartender after he said that he deserves a tip? *Disclaimer: This happened in Canada where tipping is expected in most restaurant service jobs.*

I went out yesterday with a group of friends and at the end of the night, I paid up my tab of $22, using $42 (two $20s and $2)

Before I could get a work out about what I wanted for change the bartender said ""so you want an even $20 bill eh? What about my tip?"" 

A little surprised, I said  "" Uh nah man, just a $10 and two $5s."" Once I had the change back I said ""But anyone who demands a tip won't get one from me"", and walked back to my table.

*Note: At this bar, servers and bartenders seperately pool their tips and the cook staff take percentages from each pool.*
I previously had this knowledge so I left a larger tip for the server instead. 

My friends think I am TA for not tipping the bartender. One friend in particular is incredibly upset with me, as he is a former bartender and told me they depend on those tips to survive, even if it means haggling customers.

As a tourism industry worker, I believe tips are earned through hard work and good customer relations, which is why I did not tip the bartender. 

So Reddit, am I the asshole for not tipping my bartender after he said he deserves one?

**Edit: As per info request:** I had intended on tipping the bartender with one of the $5s, as I can be a little generous when intoxicated. 
Most of my interactions were with the server, with only 1 drink order coming from the bartender. When he asked for the tip, it threw off my customer relations way of tipping and I thought the server deserved more for being more polite and doing more work for our table.

96,ebxn4f,"AITA for abandoning my siblings during my parents divorce? On mobile so I’m sorry if there’s any strange formatting. 

So I’m significantly older than both of my siblings, which always made me be a second parent to them. They turn to me for advice all the time and it’s always my responsibility to help cheer them up or distract them when times get hard. My parents have always had a very rocky relationship, bordering on mentally abusive at times. Being the oldest I always took the brunt of the abuse and was tormented by my dad specifically. It led to me being incredibly depressed in high school. Now that I’ve been out of the house and away from them for years, my mental health has improved a lot! 

However earlier this year my mom began to suspect something was up, and even called on me to spy on my dad when he was out of town on a “work trip” in the city I happened to also work in. I felt this was wrong on a lot of levels and refused. These types of demands never ended though and I soon became her go-to to stress and vent and complain about all of this. This brought up a lot of negative emotions and I began to revert back to my more depressed mindset. It of course came out that my dad was having an affair so now the divorce is ongoing. 

Neither of them know how to manage their anger so as I pull away it’s being taken out on my siblings, who are really young, only 13 and 10. They have screaming matches in front of them, emotionally manipulate them to cheer for one parent over the other, and then blame them for the marriage failing. It even led to my 10 year old brother being put on an anti-depressant, which my dad made him come off of. So it’s very hard for them. 

With all of this I developed an eating disorder that got pretty bad, and I’m receiving treatment for. None of them know about this. To try and help myself, I’ve just sworn off from visiting or calling or being a part of family holidays. But my sister called me and “jokingly” said how even if I’m going through a lot, she’s going through a divorce. And she needs me and feels abandoned.

She constantly lies about having done stuff until called out on it, then gets angry and yells till you walk away. 
 
Anyways, she said she needed to get her school payment info for 2015. She went to local community college (CC). She said she can't get into CC account, which is similar to the one I use at my school to get my 1098-T (Tuition tax form.) She claimed to call them in mid December after harassing her for weeks about it. ""It's in the mail,"" I was told. It's still not here and she dodges any attempt to talk about it. 

Today, I decided to try and log into her account myself. I was told she didn't know the username or password. It took my less than 10 minutes to figure out how to reset the password. All I needed was the last four of her social and birthday. She claimed they deactivated it because she didn't enroll in the latest semesters. She stopped after one semester, Fall 2014. Bullshit. Also, I found the tax forms needed. Clearly she made no attempt to log in and check, and I'm sure the school would have told her to just do this instead if she had called. But she chose to lie to me.


Am I the asshole for going into her account like this? I need her to do her taxes for my FAFSA, but I know this is going to cause a huge argument with her either way. 


Thought it would be best to hear an outside opinion about this.
 

 
Edit 2: Thinking about it now, it might have been best to suggest we ""try it"" and do it with her. Might go about that method tonight instead of saying I just logged in myself. That way she doesn't know I actually logged in without talking to her about it first."
99,9r76fm,"AITA for being more upset than my mom? My grandpa was put on hospice after a 20 year battle with Parkinson's.  We're going to lose him very soon. For years we have seen this as he's so unhappy/frustrated in a body/mind that just doesn't work anymore, and it's time. We all knew this was coming, and it's not sudden.  However, I've been kept a little out of the loop on his health lately.  He's been in a VA hospital/assisted living for almost 5 years. Evidently, he's been declining steadily and no one mentioned it to me. (Not offended, just miffed). I've always seen him on his good days.

 I'm a wreck and can't stop crying since the hospice announcement.  He is extremely important to me and understands me in a way that my parents and siblings never have (at least before his mind started to go).

So, with me being an absolute wreck, my mom (his eldest daughter) is handling it pretty well on the outside (but I know she's actually upset). 

I called her to see how she's doing and I started crying (couldn't help it). She got really mad because he's not dead yet and I'm overreacting.

Am I? And am I the asshole for being ""too emotional"" when my grandma, mom, and aunts are handling this way better than I am?

100,a4920p,"AITA for not caring if my parents take my sister's dog to the pound. Before the 4th dog, we had 3 dogs, dogs 1 and 2 are both old and on their last lag. I take care and love all of these dogs. They had been my dogs for my childhood and teenage years. I groomed them, played with them, fed them, they slept in my bed. But dog 1 eventually died, I had cared for him during his last days and was the one who carried him into the vet. But my sister who never cared for these dogs the way I did wanted to be the only one in the room for his euthanizing. 

None of these dogs were supposed to be mine, dog 1 was supposed to be my sisters. Dog 2 was supposed to be my mother's. Dog 3 was my older sisters. But somehow they all fell into my hands at around 16, I'm 21 now. 

The day after dog 1 died my sister and mom got a new dog. Dog 4. I was surprised by the dog and didn't know how to react. It was clear she just wanted to replace dog 1. And I knew immediately I had a new dog to care for. Surprisingly enough she cared for him for about a month and a half. I never had to clean his stuff, she almost even taught him how to not piss in the house. But she grew tired and stopped cleaning up after him, and he became my responsibility because she would neglect his needs. 

I eventually took dog 2 to be euthanized and dog 3 is now on his last leg. This is where the problem lies. I'm tired of caring for dog 4. I didn't ask for him, he wasn't my responsibility, when asked who the dog belongs to my sister claims him.

I'm finally moving out in a few months. My schedule has been tight and I've had a lot less time for the dogs. So my parents said if I can't take care of them they would take dog 4 to the shelter. And I just wasn't phased by it. I didn't care. I knew I wouldn't have time for another dog. I didn't ask for him and I didn't want the dog.

So AITA for not caring anymore?

Edit: more info I forgot

Dog 4 was eventually trained by me to not piss everywhere. He was trained by me how to sit. My sister takes full credit of everything. The thing is, if I move out and I can take him with me it would change everything, but I can't afford a dog and even if I could my sister would scream that I am taking her dog. "
101,dwd44j,"AITA to no let my father's girlfriend sleep in my bed? So basically as the title said, my father ( 50) is calling me (20M) an asshole because i won't allow his girlfriend to sleep on my bed even though she is feeling pain on her neck.

&#x200B;

So now let's explain the whole WEIRD situation.

&#x200B;

To start it all from the beginning, our family was friend for 9 years long with Emily (49F) and  Emily's husband. Everything was going fine, nice friendship between both of our family etc... until my  mother  was really sick for a long time and passed away a few months ago.

&#x200B;

After legit only 1 month, my father told me that he found a new girlfriend who is indeed Emily  and she is still married!!!

&#x200B;

So now, they are hooking up in front of Emily's husband and the husband is not saying anything and he is still a really close friend to my father.

&#x200B;

When Emily and my father told to her husband that they are in a relationship,

the husband was not mad at all and completly agree and was happy about it.

&#x200B;

At this moment, my mind was blown, so i told the situation that his and her are in and they just told me that it was ME the weird guy and that they do not understand me.

&#x200B;

The weirdest thing for me was that my dad took only 1 month after my mom death to be in couple with Emily. I suspect him to have been cheating on my mother when she was still alive.

Now, Emily is acting like she is my mother and i'm receiving orders from her. For example, when i do the cleaning she is telling me that i'm doing it wrong and i have to do it like this, i can't eat what i want, which i do not accept because,  she is not my mother and the respect has to be in both sides.

&#x200B;

So when i refuse her orders, my father is yelling and beating me and i have to do what she says even though at the very beginning of their relationship, he told me that i do not have to accept any of her orders!!!

( Oh yeah, i almost forgot Emily has 2 son ( 20M) (18M) and they don't know that her mother has a relationship with my dad).

&#x200B;

After this explanation let's go back to the main subject,

My father, Emily and her  soon ex-husband are going into my appartment in a few weeks to visit my town.

My appartment is  20,3318 yard so 17m².

They will be 1 individual bed, and 2 air mattress.

My father wants me to give to Emily my own bed because she has neck pain issues.

&#x200B;

If Emily and my father were more respectful to me, i would give the bed no doubt about it, but then i refused, and now they are both super angry and mad at me.

&#x200B;

Btw, i can't refuse them the access of my appartment because if i do that, my dad will cut the bridge between him and me.

102,d8eakm,"AITA for asking my girlfriend to let a guy know she’s not single? My girlfriend (21F call her Aly) and I (23M) are closing in on a year together. She’s gone to China for 4 months to do a work term and is having trouble finding other English-speaking people. She went with one classmate and they share a room, so they’ve basically only had each other to talk to for a few weeks.

Later, they met this guy (lets call him John) and his 2 buddies and have been hanging out. Lately, John has been hitting on Aly more and more physically, which has been making her uncomfortable enough to complain to me about it. I suggested she mention that she has a boyfriend and maybe he’ll stop the physical touch (I also suggested she sternly say no or stand up for herself, but she’s a bit shy/timid so I didn’t think she would agree). She declined because she thinks if John does something and she replies with “I have a boyfriend” he might take it the wrong way and stop talking to her, which would suck for her because he is her ""in"" to more English people (John is in China full time, so can probably introduce to more English speakers). I then suggested that while she is hanging out with him she could, in passing, mention it, like when I message her she murmurs “oh its my boyfriend” or something. Basically sneak it in there randomly so its not seen as a direct response to some action on his part.

When I explained to her that he is not going to stop if he thinks he has a chance, and that perhaps eventually he might try crossing the line and you will have to tell him anyway, and it’s kind of leading him on, she got upset with me. She said she can’t be going around telling people she has a boyfriend as soon as they hi to her and that I am being controlling and that it’s her business. I dropped it then because I didn't want to fight.

A few days later she was telling me about another guy who was hitting on her and how it was annoying I said yeah and we've already talked about this. I didn't care at all about the new guy because it was just over text, but I mentioned it to her that he just met you and is very plainly hitting on you and is moving in to your same residence, he will definitely try something. She did the whole ""Here we go again"" about being controlling, and how I need to be okay with guys hitting on her and approaching her.

I've told her many times I don't mind at all if guys hit on her and I trust her completely, but am merely suggesting a solution to something that she said made her uncomfortable.

AITA for telling her that she should probably tell the guy(s) hitting on her that she has a boyfriend (in some roundabout way, if not directly)?

&#x200B;

EDIT: What she meant by me having to be okay with her getting hit on is that I need to be okay with letting her handle it, and not tell her how to do it."
103,8a1d6s,"AITA for not talking to/ being rude to my co-workers who try to talk to me while I eat? So I work in a warehouse and since I start really early, I eat my lunch before a majority of the company. So I sit at my desk, pull up reddit, and eat my food quietly (with headphones on, mind you. My company lets me wear at least one ear bud in at all times.) 

Well, every single day, no matter what, my boss or another co-worker will come up to me with the whole,”Hey, are you busy?” act and ask me questions. I used to set my food down and stop what I’m doing to help out if I can (and still will if it’s urgent. Not to mention to not be rude to my boss and keep my job haha), but lately I’ve been responding with,”I’m actually eating my lunch right now, can we address this later?” Sometimes it’s fine and they’ll come to me later, but lately some people have been getting almost offended it seems.

104,d1g94x,"AITA for demanding my Mom stops tracking my phone? My Mom and I (17m) have been arguing a lot recently about her tracking of my phone.

Starting a couple years ago, my Mom found an app that would allow her to track me. She made me download it and also forced me to turn off the ""power-saving mode"" on my phone so that the location would be perfectly accurate. Lately, I have started university and I've been finding that my battery is not lasting the whole day, so I decided to turn on power-saving mode. She didn't notice for some time, but my Mom eventually found out and tried to force me to turn it back off. I refused, saying it's stupid that she has to track my phone in the first place and I threatened to delete the app entirely. Then, she completely flipped out saying, ""That isn't an option. It's the only way for me to have peace of mind while you're out and as long as I'm paying for your phone, I get to make those decisions"".

I already have to give her the passwords to my emails and other important accounts and I have to endure crazy levels of interrogation whenever I go out.

I just want to be a little independent and not feel like I 'm under surveillance 24/7. AITA?"
105,c3buua,"AITA for not talking to my mom for weeks after she sent a curse on me? So, this story takes place some time ago, around 2 and a half years. My parents were divorced for 3 years at the time and my mom never accepted the divorce. 

She liked to complain about life and stay at home crying that she didn't have any friends or a boyfriend (when she wasn't working).

I was alone with her and she used to put it all over me when she was depressed or stressed. I just took it silently and pretended it never happened, she liked it that way.

One day, when I started dating my boyfriend, she noticed that I wasn't spending much time at home and was very upset about it as she liked to complain to me about life. So she came to me and said I couldn't go. And I said he was coming to pick me up so I was going either way. She said I wasn't allowed to go. I said that I was as I am an adult and make my decisions. 

She then said ""Well, you're going to be all alone and unwanted just like me. This boyfriend of yours is going to leave you in no time and you're going to suffer a lot.""

I couldn't say a word, I just walked away and left. This made me so sad that this time I wouldn't pretend nothing happened until she apologized. 
She just did it almost a month after that.

I know my mom was depressed and I know that we should always support people with depression and understand that mental illness but I just couldn't take it anymore.

Nowadays I do therapy and so does my mom so we're good.

But... Was I the asshole?"
106,dznunq,"AITA for keeping my disability accommodations after a re-evaluation pronounced me non-disabled? I (42F) have suffered from mental health issues (at least that is how it felt) and have been in an out of therapy since my teens. My diagnoses have included ADHD, autism spectrum (what was formerly called Asperger's), depression, anxiety, and a few other things. 

I have an extremely demanding job (high stress and long hours) and have managed to be a top performer so long as I have a few accommodations in place in connection with my disabilities. I work an an open plan office (no walls/privacy) but am allowed to wear headphones while doing solo work at my desk. I am also allowed to take breaks when needed so long as I don't interrupt meetings, miss urgent deadlines, or otherwise inconvenience my colleagues in doing so. (For employees without accommodations, headphones are generally not permitted and due to the demanding nature of the job breaks are otherwise discouraged - a lot of people work 10-12+ hours straight and eat all their meals at their desk.)

I recently changed therapists and my new old told me that she thinks all my prior diagnoses are BS - that basically I'm bad with people from having a traumatic childhood (but am not actually autistic) and that I have poor emotional regulation and poor mental discipline (leading to symptoms that mimic anxiety, depression and ADHD). So I am supposed to let my office know that my diagnoses were wrong and that I don't need my accommodations anymore because I'm not actually disabled. 

AITA for not passing this info along to my office yet? The truth is that, diagnoses or not, headphones and breaks make me much, much more productive. I think most of us will agree that open plan offices and grueling work schedules both suck. Also, I provide my own headphones, and I'm exempt (paid for overall job output and performance, not specific hours on the clock) - I still have to get all my work done each day. So it's not like the accommodations cost my employer anything. Still, withholding the info isn't sitting very well with me, and my therapist says I need to ""learn to live in the real world"" and not use my past diagnoses as a crutch."
107,eawoow,"AITA if I want to stay at my moms house in the weekends? I’m on Mobile so sorry in advance for the bad layout.

Important info: my parents are divorced and I go to my dads house on the weekends. I also don’t have my own room at my dads house.


Backstory: I was a very active kid. I played softball and cheer at the same time. I was better at softball than cheer but these activities kept me active and not sitting around. What knocked me off my feet was when my dad found a lump on my shoulder that doctors would later diagnose as Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. Treatment for this cancer gave me a different type called Acute Lymphocytic leukemia which I am now in a year of remission from. But these cancers left me out of shape because for two years I hadn’t done much athletic wise and gained about 30lbs. 

        

      My heart was under a lot of stress which left me with heart problems and haven’t been able to be as active. I tried out for my high school tennis team but just in the warm ups I could feel my heart racing. It felt like it was skipping a beat every few minutes. I told my dad (who was there just in case something happened) that I didn’t feel my body was ready for this type of activity yet. As we were leaving I started crying because I already knew that my dad was disappointed. When we got in the car he was belittling me, asking me what else I was going to quit so he didn’t have to waste money and saying how I was a quitter. I just sat there in tears as he was driving me back to my moms house. I didn’t know what else to do. My brother (who is very active) caught wind of this and when we get into arguments he says “well at least I’m not a quitter”. They both will use this against me and since I’m at my dads house when this happens, I feel like I’m trapped. My dad has threatened my mom to go to court to take custody of my brother and I. I’m scared because he says he won’t be mad if I choose my mom, but I know that isn’t true. I have told how this makes me feel but he doesn’t seem to care.

I walked him

I played with him 

I cleaned his shit

And then my mom starts saying ""I want to matte one"" the sales lady turns to me and says ""ok, do you want the matte one?""

I say, ""No I want dewy"" because I always buy dewy I didn't think it would be so problematic.

But then my mom starts saying, ""No dewy looks bad you have to buy matte""

So I say ""Well just let me buy the one I like"" the sales lady is annoyed at her for confusing her, I'm annoyed because she's making a scene. So my mom just storms out and now I'm chasing after her saying fine I'll buy the matte one.

-16 °C or 3 °F @ 6:30 am (when I arrived at work)

-6 °C to 21 °F @ 2:30 pm (when I left work)



So I have always been more adapted to the cold than most people. Ever since I have been young I have hardly worn a coat in the winter since I am comfortable with the cold. Heck, a few years back I spent 8 hours in -35°C (-31°F). I'm also on the chubbier side so I have more insulation. When I have worn a coat, I sweat, and I mean a lot. For years this has been a struggle with people who don't/can't seem to understand that I am comfortable and better adapted to the cold. 



For the past few months I haven't really worn a coat and my coworkers have been teasing me about it with me explaining that I handle the cold better. This all came to a head today when my coworker called reckless and a liability. He threatened to tell our regional manager as I was a safety violation in his eyes. I responded that he doesn't get to tell me how my body feels and that if I don't want to wear a coat then I don't have too. After he threatened I told him go ahead, I will fight you on this tooth and nail. So Reddit, who's the asshole here?

He didn't, he just went on bursting them. 

That's when I kind of lost my cool and asked him if the pollution wasn't enough already? 

He's like no, it's not that bad.

 Here's some depth. 

Me and this girl used to be best friends eventually we grew apart and haven't seen each other for a while although do have some on and off messages to check in with each other. She has a son who's 5 and often asks to go on play dates but I always make an excuse and say no. 

Her son seems to be brought up differently to how I bring my little one up. She allows swearing and laughs when he says ""booty and bitches that's what I like"" and various things to that nature. He seems to be quite frankly a little shit, he rules the roost more or less and gets away with murder. He plays GTA and COD ect so gets alot of bad language from that. He doesn't seem to understand the word no. As far as I'm aware he doesn't hit and things but the way he speaks and acts is shocking and dont want my child learning from it. 

In all honestly I also dont like how shes changed and dont agree with alot of what she does when child free. It's been hard to watch her become the person she is now because I know in most ways this isnt her, but suppose we just have different lifestyles now. We've become more acquaintances than friends. ""A girl I used to know"" sort of thing. She has alot of people around her but none that seem good for her or that genuinely care. I'm wondering if shes reaching out as a way to move away from things (maybe I'm looking too much into it) but I have my own family and life now and I wont get tangled in anyone else's. Mine comes first no matter what. 

But I cant help but feel bad for keep putting her off and on the brink of telling her why but I dont want to upset her or comment on her parenting because that's none of my business, but shes starting to ask questions. 

It's been a while since I have spoken to my husband about it but on last check he says I was in the right and also doesn't want our little one picking up his bad habits. AITA? Why do I feel so bad?

WIBTA if I slowly cut her off? Shes just not the sort of person I want to associate myself with but feel bad for deleting her off things and not having contact because shes not done anything wrong to me shes just completely changed from the girl I once knew. I dont want to upset her either.

I have a tight knit friend group. Majority of them have been friends since high school (we're now all late 20's) with a few of us trickling in during our early 20's. Either way, we're the sort of friends that have been together for so long that we're very real and honest with each other. We're kinda a misfit bunch and one of the guys has always been a bit of a mess. His apartment has been so unclean at points that his neighbors have complained from the smell. That's bad. He's left rancid meat in the sink for weeks, because I don't know. Laziness? Depression?

He's always struggled with addiction and what not. He complains about his life, wants it to be better, but never actually takes action. 

I've tried getting him in therapy too many times to count, and I can't force him. I'm on meds myself and have even suggested doctors for him to see but he's just uninterested in helping himself. I hate to see him like this. We butt heads big time, but he's still my friend and I feel wrong just sitting on the sidelines while he runs himself deeper into this hole of drugs and pity. 

Now to the actual issue, he's made friends with some of my old neighbors at my last apartment. They're dealers, used to do heroine, and regularly do coke. These old neighbors aren't inherently bad people, just always high I guess. I smoke weed like a mother fucker, so no judgement there, but the coke that Jason is doing regularly is pushing him further down. He's getting worse, we're seeing less of him because he's just obsessed with the idea of always needing more coke and I don't allow it in my house.

I sound like a mother, but he really just fell into a stupid bad crowd for him. I don't want to see him hooked on heroine next. The old neighbors, which are a couple, have had a really rocky relationship. The girl constantly offers herself sexually to the men that come around, and once the boyfriend finds out that guy is banned from their place. I happen to know that this girl offered herself to Jason, but the boyfriend never found out.

So, I'm conflicted. I could potentially get Jason out of a bad situation by telling the boyfriend what I know (he would definitely listen to me) or I could just let him continue to spiral. I'm not really sure what the right move is here and if I'd be sticking my nose where it doesn't belong.

She lied to her boyfriend and said all it had been was messaging, unfortunately I know better than that. I found out she had actually stayed with her ex boyfriend for several days and slept with him - something her current boyfriend is completely unaware of. 

Just knowing is eating away at me and I can’t even look at him without feeling guilty. I want to tell him but I know that my sister would probably never speak to me again which would suck considering we only got back onto speaking terms a year or so ago. WIBTA for telling the truth?"
116,cqcn21,"AITA for threatening to leave my boyfriend's work trip early? My boyfriend (26M) travels for work every week to a city well-known for its nightlife. He's been having a great time going out at night and always says he wants me (26F) to join so that he can show me around.

We've been trying to figure out a good time to travel together and decided on this week. The plan was: I join him on his flights and stay in his hotel room. I ""work from home"" in said room during the day, and he meets me after work to show me around. He said he had a lot of fun ideas for dinner and drinks. He's been very busy lately (often works late). So I told him several times that I only want to join if he won't be working late on the 2 nights that I'm there. He insisted it would be easy to leave the office around 6pm if he told his coworkers that his friend was in town.

On Tuesday, I work from the hotel room. I ask around 3pm when he thinks he'll be leaving the office. He says he should be back by 6:30pm. Cool! 6:30pm rolls around and I get a text saying that he's still at the office but is packing up to leave. No problem! I calculate that he'll be back around 7:00pm and start to get ready for our date night. 7:00pm comes and goes but he's not back. 7:30pm hits and I get a text from him: ""still at the office but should be leaving soon."" This is when I get upset. It would have been easy to text an updatee but instead he keeps me in radio silence for an hour. I'm done getting ready so I sit on the bed and put headphones in to relax. A little after 8:00pm I check my phone that's been facedown to reveal 2 missed calls and a text from 1 min ago. The text says that his room key didn't work and he knocked on the door. I go to the door but don't see him, so figure he went to get a new one. A few minutes later he walks in and says sternly ""WHY DIDN'T YOU OPEN THE DOOR."" I say that I had music in and my phone was facedown. He then asks if I've picked a spot for dinner. What? He was the one that had ""so many ideas.""

At this point I'm pissed. The silent pissed where you don't want to talk to the other person. He left me waiting and then got mad about a small inconvenience. He sold me a vision of him leaving work around 6pm for us to grab dinner and go out, yet shows up to the hotel after 8pm. He says he has ideas but doesn't.

By the time we get to dinner it’s 9pm. He asked what my issue is to which I say that I don't want to get into it there. He calls the waiter over and asks for a check and a to-go box halfway through the meal. On the way back to the hotel he says that I have no reason to be mad at him for working late, I've ruined the trip, and that I'm a mean person for not talking about it at the restaurant. Still pissed, I say that based on how I'm feeling now I don't want to be here and would rather take a flight out by myself in the morning. He didn't talk to me after that and hasn't texted back today even though I'm still here. AITA? Are my expectations too high?"
117,coz1yj,"AITA for demanding my sister and her boyfriend pay me back for drinking my whisky. My sister started living with me recently and pays me reduced rent. I was away from home for about a week due to work. I gave her a simple rule of forbidding her bringing anyone over. Not her new boyfriend or her friends. No exceptions to this rule. Well she broke that rule.

During my week away. One of her Instagram posts showed her BF wearing one of my jackets on a night out. I called her out on it and she apologised and told me she put everything back. So now I know that he has been in my room and going through my things. 

What killed me inside was that she also had a party. Lots of drinking involved. Including my vintage whisky. They cost me around £7000 and were near full. So I demanded that they pay me back. 

My sister is begging me that she didn't know and thought her boyfriend bought them. Her boyfriend blocked me and called me crazy. He is now thinking about breaking up with her over this. Everyone I know is calling me an asshole for demanding they cover my loss. Apparently I should forgive a simple mistake. So AITA?"
118,bnceag,"AITA for not giving a 10 year old kid special treatment at a hip hop show? This was last night. A hip hop concert in Baltimore. 

I, a 5’1” girl in my 20s, can never see shit at these things. I’m standing behind this big guy who keeps ripping disgusting farts... craning my neck and bobbing and weaving trying to see some of the show.

In front of this guy is a glorious empty space, just behind the front row. There’s a 10 year old boy at the rail on the front row having a great time. Behind him is room for 15 people... it’s 5 feet deep by like 7 feet wide. I think, perfect, I can stand in that spot, see everything, and still be like 2 feet away from the kid.

I step into the spot beaming, when suddenly a Karen gets in my face. “Sorry, but you can’t step past this line,” *gestures vaguely 5 feet back from the front row,* “because I have to watch my baby.”

Me: “Ok, so you stand behind him, and I’ll stand behind you.”

Her (looking incredulous): “he’s a *ten year old kid!*”

Me: You’re not entitled to a quarter of the front row just because you decided to bring your child to a bar??? 

Her: *PHYSICALLY GRABS ME BY BOTH SHOULDERS AND MOVES ME OUT OF THEIR AREA!*

I was fucking fuming at this point, but I keeps it classy, so I threw her a “why did you reproduce” glare and went on my way. To top it off, it turns out the Fartmeister is Bar Kid’s papa.

I was really ticked off, but I swear that Karen looked at me like I was suggesting we Princess Shireen her precious little bar hopper. AITA?"
119,cpgp6g,"WIBTA if I told my friend’s mom that he is in a downward spiral? I (20M) have/had a friend and former roommate (22M) who is spiraling in a bad way. I did post about the relationship aspect of this in r/relationships, but things have quickly continued to get worse and I’m genuinely concerned for the guy. 

My friend developed strong feelings for my girlfriend, and expressed them to me that he wanted to date her. I obviously told him that wasn’t going to happen, but he was very drunk when he said this to me. His drinking has been getting bad over the last year. When he sobered up, he didn’t take back anything he said, so my girlfriend and I chose to cut ties with him. I’ve been staying with her while we pack to move to our new apartment. Friend made getting the rest of my things from our apartment difficult and made a lot of horrible comments about my girlfriend, calling her terrible names and saying she deserved abuse from her previous relationship. He was also very drunk at that time.

My gf and I both blocked his number, but he has been reaching out to mutual friends to try to get the address of our new apartment. They have been ignoring him too, and some have blocked him, but he’s not stopping. He went to my girlfriends place of work the other day (she is a nanny, so works in the family’s home) to “talk things out” with her, and left when she asked him to, but it did lead to her getting fired, since the parents don’t want to risk him showing up again. She has worked for them for almost 2 years and understands but is devastated. 

This leads me to my question. Friend clearly needs help that I cannot (and at this point will not) provide. I know in the past he has mentioned his mom being very overbearing/overprotective growing up, so I believe if I contacted her on Facebook, she would be very proactive in finding help for him. My girlfriend feels that me contacting friends mom would be more of a revenge act because he’s made our lives hell for a few weeks now, he needs to get help on his own, and we need to distance ourselves completely from him. I feel like he needs help for drinking and possible mental illness, and even if I can’t be friends with him anymore, I want to get help for him. I know his mom can’t force him to get help, but she can probably do more than any of us. So, WIBTA if I “reported” my friend’s actions and heavy drinking to his mom?"
120,dcssvu,"WIBTA if I limited visits with my MIL because she blatantly disrespects me? I’m not with the father of my son but we are working together to try and make things stable for our 10 month old son. It’s not really working out that well though. Anyway.... 

His mom is a nightmare. She disrespects me constantly. She’s told her son to leave me forever because I called her out on giving him a benzo when he was drunk (wtf?), doesn’t listen to me when I say “don’t put blankets or stuff in the crib with the baby” and when I call her out on it she just says “I know but I was watching him the whole time”, she’s gone through her sons phone when he was sleeping and read our conversations, wouldn’t take no for an answer on my first Mother’s Day when she kept asking to babysit my son so I could go out, most recently she came into my home when I was across the country and she took anything her family has given my son (books, clothes, toys) that I got for baby shower gifts as well as anything she gave to me when I was with my SO. (Random stuff like new baking sheets and some dishes and towels ect. I don’t care about that stuff). She was specifically told not to take anything from the house by my ex and his dad and she still did it anyway,she’s screamed in my face saying she’ll take my son and then the next day said she never said that. When I got two witnesses to back me up she said she meant something completely different (I meant If you guys didn’t stop fighting someone would call the police and take the baby!! We weren’t yelling)

So I feel uncomfortable with my son going to her house. My Ex SO says I don’t have to like her but she’s the grandma so she has rights. I’ve never said she couldn’t see him, I always say she can come here to see him and I’ll go upstairs or go outside or whatever. My ex so and I recently broke up so he was still living here therefore I said she could come to our home anytime to see the baby. I’ve also brought him over then SOOOO MANY TIMES, in fact she has Only come here once in the ten months he’s been around to visit him. Every other time she saw the baby, we brought him to her. She lives 15 mins away. 

I don’t trust her and she disrespects me. I don’t really want her teaching my son it’s okay to not listen to the things I say. Not to mention the obvious safety issue I have with her when she ignores my direct instructions of not putting anything in the crib with the baby (the DOCTOR TOLD ME THAT) WIBTA if I limited visits? My ex SO wants to take him over there without me now and I feel uncomfortable with it because he doesn’t have any problem with how his mother treats me/her blatant disregard of safety instructions and she and him actively enable each other’s shitty behaviour (his alcoholism and her being shitty to people and never having to own up to it) keep in mind we just recently broke up so I’m not saying I expect her to always come to my house to see my son. Obviously his dad is going to have him at his house and they can do whatever. Edit to add: we don’t have a custody agreement and where I live if there isn’t a CA my ex can take the baby and not bring him back"
121,cz88ds,"AITA for being uncomfortable with my wife's male coworker sharing a hotel room with us? For some context, my wife and I are in our late 20s and have been married for less than a year. We live in the US and are going to an event in a few months. I was looking into booking lodging recently and my wife mentioned that her male coworker (who liked her romantically prior to our marriage) will be staying with us. I thought it wouldn't be such a big deal if we're doing an AirBNB, but she noted that we can share a hotel room as long as he gets a separate bed. I expressed my being uncomfortable (slightly upset even), but she said we discussed this while we (my wife and I) were out drinking a couple weekends ago and she doesn't see why it's a big deal.

Am I being unreasonable for not readily agreeing to this immediately? As a fairly fresh newlywed, I'm not sure what to think about this or occasionally, I ask myself if my wife even loves me at times.

Update: this trip isn't for work

Update 2: the event is for a shared hobby. The male coworker has a gf, but his gf will not be coming. My wife said that I agreed to sharing lodging with him the night the two of us (wife and I) went drinking. I asked if I specifically agreed to sharing the same room as him (as opposed to sharing the same suite/apt/etc.) and she asked why it matters since we're all adults here. She doesn't see how sharing the same room is any different from some guy sleeping in the living room on a separate bed. I have never met this coworker in person."
122,bqz2qk,"AITA for being annoyed at my mother in law for letting my 2 year old get sunburnt? So my MIL watches my 2 yr old daughter one day a week while I’m at work (she’s at nursery rest of the week). She plays in the garden with her etc, i always leave sun cream out for her, as well as sun hat, sunglasses, etc. 

Last week when I got home my daughter had a fairly big patch of sunburn on her arm, I asked if she had put suncream on her when she was outside, MIL said she must have missed a spot. I left it at that as never had any issues before. But next day at nursery it was so embarrassing having to tell her teachers she was sunburnt, I felt like they were shocked by it and I felt awful (even though it wasn’t my fault!) 

Anyway I’ve come home today and my daughter is covered in sunburn, her face is bright red and her arms are covered in it. She’s really upset when I put cream on, I feel so bad for her. I was so angry with MIL I asked her again if she put suncream on, she said she did. I said she needs to keep applying it often when she’s outside- she said she only put it on once the whole day! I didn’t have a go at her or lose my temper, I just told her that she needs to make sure she is always covered in cream and left it at that. 

Since she’s left I’m even madder about it, I know she feels guilty about it. AITA for being this angry at her? Is it normal for kids that age to get sunburn? She’s never had it before and feel like if I was watching her it would never happen!"
123,eootaw,"AITA for getting mad at someone for ""outing"" me as a bulimic(even though I'm not) Hey! Obligatory this is on mobile, sorry for formatting, blah blah blah.

&#x200B;

This happened on New Years, but my friends are kind of pissed still, so I kinda wondered if I was TA.

I have a very low alcohol tolerance. I get drunk after maybe 1 or 2 glasses, so I generally only drink once every few months. On New Years, I packed myself into the car to go to my friend Megan's house. We got there, turned on Grey's Anatomy, and popped out the happy juice.

&#x200B;

Needless to say-around midnight, I was very,very drunk.

I woke up on Jan 1 with a killer headache and an urge to vomit. I knew I was going to throw up soon, so I stuck my toothbrush down my throat and threw up in the toilet. No biggie.

&#x200B;

I should also mention that I eat a lot. Not like the 6-foot long sub guy, but enough for 1.5 people. I try to bring my own shit to parties because I don't want to eat all the food.

I didn't remember much from last night, but I did recall eating quite a few chicken wings.

As I walked out of the bathroom, Megan confronted me. She demanded as to if I was bulimic or not. Like, full on Karen demanding. I found this kind of funny, so I just rolled my eyes at her and walked away. Fast forward to Jan. 4, when I found a FB post with something along the lines of:

'Going to pray for u/chaosleashed, she needs all the love you can spare.'

Obviously, people comment and ask why, and she comments on how I have some problems with eating.

I got mad and commented on how some people act like fucking Karens. She blocked me, and a lot of my friends are pissed.

My justification is, if I was actually bulimic, I would have been humiliated to have been outed in such a way.

Was I TA?

Edit:Is this my Karen?

124,byrlym,"AITA for not wanting to be around MIL I never had a problem with my MIL before my son was born. I knew she was overbearing and a bit crazy, but I was never really around her.

Prior to baby, we only hung around his family for special occasions. And even then, we always made plans afterwards so we would have an excuse to leave early. My H can only take his parents (his mom) in short doses.

Fast forward to 2 years ago when LO was born. Everything changed. MIL couldnt make the transition from parent to grandparent. She made it clear that LO was HER baby and that she was going to do whatever she wanted.

she crossed all my boundaries. She did not care what I wanted for my child. I would tell her not to do something and she would do it behind my back. She even went so far as to lie about it. I would ask her to her face and she would lie repeatedly.

Over time I started to hate her. The mention of her name would send me into a panic attack. I cant even tell you the number of times I've cried over something she did. I wanted to parent my child, but she made me feel less than and that I was inferior to her authority.

She has no respect for us. She has said that whatever my H tells her goes in one ear and out the other. In the past he has attempted to talk to her about what bothers me but she doesnt care.

When LO was about 5 months old, I reached a breaking point. I felt physically ill and mentally drained. I know MIL will always be a part of my life because she will always be a part of LO's life. Because of that, I seeked out therapy.

And I'm doing so much better. I still cant stand MIL but I no longer cry. She has not changed but I have learned how to deal with it better.

A part of why I no longer feel horrible is because I distance myself from her. Outside of special occassions, I opt out of activities. If I'm not around her then I dont feel bad. Being around her causes anxiety...which my H knows.

 It bothers my H that I dont wabt to hang out with his mom. He doesnt like that I dont want to eat lunch with her on a random Saturday. Or that I don't want to invite her to the park with us. To him, his parents are family and even though I dont like his mom, he thinks I should suck it up and still hang out with her.

I dont keep LO from MIL. I tell my H that hes more than welcome to have lunch with his mom and LO. I jsut dont want to be there. Am I the asshoke for not sucking it up?

I'm always polite and kind when I see her. But it takes alot out of me. Especially when shes all over LO and ignores my instructions."
125,aw42ni,"AITA: For creating a group chat for just my 3 sisters (30's) and I (24f) without our parents included (we have a full family one already) because they kept omitting/ not telling us about being unwell. So this all started when I woke up with messages saying my dad had just come out of surgery and my mum was suspected of having a cancerous mass. I live across the other side of the world from my family, and my main source of contact is WhatsApp. 

My sister's were as surprised as I was and in fact, we were all very upset that we had not been told about any of this happening. We were all messaging each other what little snippets we had been told, so obviously I started a group chat so we could all talk and trade information together. My sister's were all dumbfounded we had not previously done it.

Fast forward a day and I get home from work, and get a message from my mum (56F) saying that I went behind her back and she was leaving WhatsApp because of me, essentially cutting off all contact with me. One of my lovely sisters told my mum, who has a fantastic flair for the dramatic and literally feeds off tension and drama at times, and has now decided that what I did was unforgivable. I have not been able to get in contact with her, and my dad (59M) is awful with technology/ there is no way she won't see me calling so won't answer either, even though we are super close and he probably thinks my mother is over-reacting.

All my sister's support me and still believe it was necessary as we are all concerned and can never seem to get one story. But now I am isolated from my parents, all because I wanted to know that they were okay and started a non-malicious group chat about them. Am I the Asshole? Or did mum over-react and I just need to wait for it to blow over.

(Sorry that it's long)

Tl;dr: Parents lied about their health, I started a sister's group chat to talk about what we know to comfort each other and now my mother won't talk to me."
126,bc0rwy,"AITA for hanging out with my friend against my gf's wishes? Over three years ago, my gf and I had dinner with my good friend and his gf.  Problem is that this friend was a bit of a schmuck and left my gf feeling ignored during the dinner.  She felt that he wasn't including her enough in the group conversation and I have to agree with that.  After dinner, she was very upset.  I was disappointed and said so.  I also said let's give him a chance next time, hopefully he can be more inclusive next time.

Still, even after years from this incident, my gf is hurt and angry at him.  It has got to the point - and she still has this stance - that I should not ever hang out with him again, even on my own, due to his disrespect towards her and, ultimate disrespect towards me.  I thought that stance is a bit extreme and if she doesn't want to be in his presence I get it ... but she wants me to end the friendship entirely.

She states she doesn't like the way she was treated by him AND that my asking to give him other chances was the wrong way to handle things because she felt that I was defending him.

It has been years and I wish that she would let go of this feeling of feeling slighted.

We have discussed this a few times and really I don't see him too often, maybe twice a year.

So this week, him and I caught up for dinner.  I let her know (because I don't want to be secretive about it).  I have gotten reprimanded for this and the silent treatment since.  4 days now.

I feel like she is holding on to this resentment for an unreasonable amount of time and punishing me via silent treatment.

Tell me, AITA for seeing my friend (on rare occasion) against my gf's wishes?"
127,bhh1m6,"AITA for reporting my Uber driver? I (22F) took a 30 min ride in an Uber pool today. There were 3 other girls around my age. The driver was a late 30s/early 40s man.

&#x200B;

The first 15ish minutes were silent while we dropped the first 3 girls off. Almost as soon as the last one shut the door, the driver says, “where you going, baby?” I looked at him in the rearview mirror and said “excuse me?” He stammered a little bit, and said “um, so... where are you going?” (More sheepishly, I assume because he could tell I was insulted.)

&#x200B;

At this point, I realized that he wasn’t entirely fluent in English- I gave him the benefit of the doubt and softened up a little bit. I said (in a much nicer tone) “I’m just going home.” He asked the neighborhood and I told him, although I know he already knew because I could see the map on his phone. Maybe just trying to make up for making me uncomfortable; I let it go.

&#x200B;

15ish min later, my head is leaned against the window and I’m staring off into space. I’m in the back behind the driver. He looks over his shoulder at me and says, “Are you ok, baby?” I was pretty shocked that he would call me baby again after the first interaction but unsure of whether I should directly address it. After a long pause, I said “I’m ok.” He responds “ok baby.”

&#x200B;

5 min later we pull up to my drop off spot. The driver app uses audible notifications, and it gave the drop off prompt. I heard it, so I know he heard it. Before coming to a complete stop, he says, “this ok, baby?” And didn’t stop completely until I said “yup, this is good. Thanks.” He didn't move until another car pulled up.

&#x200B;

I gave the driver 1 star and reported him. There’s no option to report specifically for behavior making you uncomfortable, only unsafe, so I chose that and explained in the notes.

&#x200B;

Uber quickly emailed a pretty personalized apology. Here is a copy paste of one snippet:

&#x200B;

“Under no circumstances should a driver act in a way that makes you uncomfortable, whether that be flirting, making sexual comments, or otherwise.

&#x200B;

I will be reaching out to the driver to further investigate this matter. That being said, we will be completing a full review of their account to evaluate whether or not they will continue to have access to the Uber app going forward.”

&#x200B;

On one hand, I feel justified because EVERY single interaction I had with this man in the car included him calling me “baby"". On the other hand: I never EXPLICITLY told him not to call me that, mainly because that would have made the entire ride WAY more uncomfortable for me. This might be this man’s only source of income. And, there could have just been a language or cultural misunderstanding that I was too initially offended to consider until now.

&#x200B;

AITA for reporting this guy and potentially getting him fired rather than just giving a bad rating and moving on? Could it have been a cultural disconnect that I was just ignorant to? Am I overreacting altogether?"
128,bfi7yg,"AITA for turning down my girlfriend? Alright so this all happened today, it's our two year anniversary today (yay!). English is not my native language so I'm sorry for any mistakes.

Anyways today me and my girlfriend celebrated our two year anniversary. We had a pretty busy day but a damn great time nonetheless. We're still so much in love, I would have never expected to meet a girl like her. We're both still young (21) but I can see a future with her for sure. 

So this morning my girlfriend wanted to have sex but I told her I would prefer it tonight because of our busy schedule. Eventually she agreed and we went on to enjoy our day. My girlfriend already has a pretty insane sex drive ever since she got an IUD and got off regular birth control, so generally speaking she wants to have sex at least once a day. I can't always keep up with her, but I want to to feel satisfied so I basically never turn her down.

Now when we came home I was really tired and not in the mood at all. I already had a long day Friday and thus I was pretty exhausted. I went to our bedroom and she came inside in new lingerie, but I told her I wasn't feeling it at all. She didn't agree and told me I had promised her, which I had, but I just wasn't feeling it at all. We argued for a bit and she got pretty upset, but she went to lay down next to me eventually. Not 5 minutes later she was masturbating right next to me and started fondling me. Again I told her I wasn't in the mood but this was a sign for her to continue. I was asleep when she climbed on top of me and went at it. She doesn't usually do this because I like to be present when we start sex, I was very confused but decided to just go with it, and it was over in idk maybe 10 minutes. I asked her why she did it and she said that she couldn't help herself and that I had promised it, and that it was our anniversary. I feel conflicted now because I did promise her we would have sex tonight, so am i the asshole for turning her down in the first place?"
129,d08ext,"AITA for taking days off work to save myself from burning out? Pre-Story that led to this decision:

I’m at a tech startup and things are pretty hectic. 2 months ago the boss decided that we should all work extra hours to increase productivity. All of us worked 12hrs minimum; we came to work Saturdays as well. That lasted for about 1.5 months.

We are seriously understaffed, so in addition to the hours, I was really overworked. (I’m a designer btw).

2 weeks in, we saw co-workers leaving because they couldn’t “keep up with the pace”. Naturally, things didn’t move as fast as we expected, but I still finished my part within that time period. I thought I could take things slower and recover a bit from all the overtime.

But no. 
Once I finalised my part, my boss told me that maybe “the design wasn’t in the style he expected” and asked if I could create a new version so he could compare. The “style” was set almost half a year ago, and I showed my proposal of how the product would look like several times to our team.

I countered that this is what we agreed on, and that I showed and confirmed the style on several occasions with users and himself before starting to create the product. Still, he encouraged me to work on a new version that would replace the one everyone is working on. Basically it meant that once we launch this product, we will replace it within a short time period without time to make adjustments based on real user feedback.


I think from that point onwards, I just started dreading to wake up and go to work. I lost motivation in work and my hobbies. It got to a point were I just didn’t care anymore when my boss told me that he wanted to see the same thing in 5 different colours before confirming that my original choice was the most appropriate. I didn’t care when he asked for changes that were trivial for actual users. I just didn’t care about anything at all. My body most likely couldn’t take the stress as well, and I ended up in the hospital, where I stayed for a week.

Last Friday I told my boss that I think I was burning out and asked for a break. He was surprised but gave me some time off from work, since none of my co-workers are dependent on me at the moment. It’s my 4th day off atm.

Yesterday I logged into my work mail, and I saw this mail from my co-worker Sarah. She told me that everyone was having a hard time and I shouldn’t be so sensitive. I was being irresponsible for taking time off, while everyone was working hard. She had “sad” moments too, but she toughens up and I should learn to do the same.

I was actually kind of proud of me for acknowledging that I am mentally and physically at a limit. But Sarah’s email made me put things in a different light. Maybe I was being overly dramatic and things aren’t as bad? Should I have sticked it out for my co-workers sake? I’d like to add that I was the only one who has taken days off.

They gave me a home, fed and clothed me, and encouraged me to strive for a higher education. My father was never really in my life. So they not only saved me from possible homelessness, but they also became even more important to me than my parents ever were.

The 3 or 4 days leading up to the surgery weren't so hard for me. But, as the day grew closer it would pop into my head more and my depression and anxiety quickly dug in roots. I had brought it up multiple times to my girlfriend and my best friend the days leading up to this incident because they noticed an obvious change in my my overall demeanor. It ended up becoming a reoccurring topic that always ended with the typical ""everything will be alright"" from them which was very appreciated. But sometimes that's not enough you know? I work in the medical field which means I'm unfortunately aware of all the things that can go wrong before and after that invasive of a surgery.

The night before his surgery I could not fall asleep. My girlfriend, of nearly three years, was over at my apartment and we'd been lying in bed for an hour or so and all I could do was toss and turn. I got up because I needed to go to the bathroom and decided I'd lurk through Reddit to distract my mind until I was tired enough to fall asleep. At this point it's around 2am and my GF sleepily asks me where I'm going. I say I'm just going to the bathroom and that she should go back to sleep. I didn't want her to worry about me more since we had just talked about it, but I knew I needed space to just get my mind off of everything. 

I keep trying to get up and go back to bed but before I even reach my room my anxiety would peak again and I'd sit right back down. A few hours pass and my GF comes out of the room, looks at me like she's pissed, and says ""what are you doing? Are you even coming to bed tonight?"". I explain that I can't sleep because I'm pretty anxious, and that I just need some space to chill out before I go to sleep. I say she should just go to sleep and that it's okay. She sighs and goes back in my room. 

She comes out less than 30 minutes later fully dressed, with all her things packed, and says she is getting an uber home. She angrily states it doesn't make sense for her to stay if I'm not going to sleep with her and if I'm going to be so weird. Needless to say I'm pretty pissed at this point. I (as calmly as I could) clarified that she understood why I was not coming to bed. She said she understood I was anxious and needed space but it was still weird and she didn't understand the point of staying if we weren't sleeping in bed together. 

Honestly still pretty hurt and we haven't talked much since she left.

AITA? Any suggestions on what to do?"
131,es4d40,"AITA for not buying a random customer some food? Pretty much what the title says. 

Today at work a customer bought a really large expensive drink at my place of work, and when I took it out to him this situation resulted.
He was a seemingly young boy. At least 15 maybe

C- customer

M- me


C: Hey can I ask you a question?

M: Of course, how else can I help you?

C: I want to get something but I don't have much money left

(my heart drops knowing what's about to come)

C: Can you buy me something?

M: I am so sorry but I have bills coming up

C: Seriously?

M: Yes, and unfortunately I barely have enough for them. I'm sorry

C: Not even for the cheapest item?

M: Not really, again I'm very very sorry

C: Some customer service. Bye jerk

I walked back inside as he left and relayed the story to my coworkers, two of which said I should have bought him food and I was a heartless shrew.

Am I really the asshole?"
132,abgz0i,"AITA New Years cuddling with a good friends crush Australia. All people at this were 18.

The friend (/friend)  in question I’ve known for most of my life. The girl (/girl)in question I’ve known for 4~ months.

Short version: New Years party at mine, all of my general friend group is over. All incredibly drunk. We decide to go for a walk up the nearby mountain and be at the peak for New Years. As we’re walking up, /Girl starts to slip on the rocky path, and she grabs onto me to stay steady. We wrap an arm around each others waist, which is fairly innocent, until we started holding hands, and her head was resting on my chest, in front of /friend. 

Once we got off the mountain, all people at the party were lying on the trampoline, and we were pretty close, playing with each others hair, snuggled up together. All the while /friend was ~2 metres away.

I didn’t plan this. /Girl and I had never had any frisson before, and this was out of the blue for me too.  /girl knows /friend likes her, and she has rejected him previously.

I’m not gonna lie, it felt great at the time. And I’d be lying if I said that’s the last time I’d do that with her, I’m totally interested in her now. But I still feel really bad for doing /friend dirty like that.  We’ve talked and he says he’s okay, but I know him better than that.

Am I the asshole, guys? Because I kinda feel like one right now."
133,b4kvkj,"AITA asshole for being annoyed that my girlfriend tells me she finds other guys attractive Early in our relationship she made comments like “wow, he’s good looking/attractive” when she saw a random guy she found attractive on the street in front of me. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t think it’s unreasonable to find other people attractive, but if I’m honest, it feels disrespectful to say it to me/in front of me? I find other women attractive, but I don’t advertise it to her. What good does that do? I told her I didn’t like that she would just blurt that out in front of me and she agreed not to do it again, but we agreed it’s normal to think others are attractive. Fast forward about 2 months and she continues making similar comments while we were having dinner at a restaurant. I got annoyed with her and didn’t say much after because I don’t feel like saying anything when I get upset. She asked me what the problem was and I told her it annoys me when she does this. She got defensive and said she was joking, and when I asked her if she forgot that she agreed not to do that or if she just didn’t care about it she said I was overreacting and that she was making a joke. I really don’t understand how that’s a joke though? I have trouble trusting her because of this to be honest.

I get that I’m being insecure, I accept that, and I should work on that. But was I an asshole here? Have you had a similar situation in your relationship? What do you think? Should partners just tell each other they are attracted to random strangers on the street? Am I being unreasonable for thinking she might cheat on me because of this? (I didn’t say that to her btw) 

Edit: fucked up the title, please forgive. "
134,acml4b,"AITA for not helping my friend earn an extra $200 without receiving a portion? This happened a little over two years ago, but I still think about it wondering if I was the asshole a lot because it ended our friendship.  I'm posting here to either get peace of mind knowing I was in the right or grow from past selfish behavior.  I've asked people over the years, but they are obviously biased towards me since they know me personally.

A couple years back, my friend was offered a supervisory for an all-day event, let's say an art fair.  The duties required being there or the entire day, hiring workers, and picking up and dropping off the supplies.  He would receive a $100 bonus for both picking up and dropping off the supplies for a total of $200.  

He hired me to work the event which was fine, but because he didn't have a car, he asked me to drive him to pick up and drop off the supplies.  I told him sure, but I requested half of what he would make since the only reason he would be able to earn the $200 bonus was with my help.  He told me no so I offered to let him borrow my car instead or negotiate down to a smaller fraction.  He got very angry because I knew he did not like to drive in the city, and I wasn't willing to drive him without compensation.

He tried to emphasize that he wouldn't be able to do it without me, and I told him that if he knew he was unable to fulfill the duties, he should have recommended me for it instead.  His argument was that it was selfish of me to demand his money  This, however, would have taken at least two hours of my time total, and I felt I was being taken advantage of given he wouldn't even offer gas money."
135,e9ovvw,"AITA for not letting my roommate borrow my debit card? I have been living with my current roommate for about 8 years. Through those years I’ve helped him immensely, and he has helped as well. When I moved in he just quit his job and didn’t have a steady source of income, and he said he was doing photography to supplement his income. To say the least it didn’t go anywhere and I was constantly asked to let him borrow money or pay my rent early and when I would let him borrow money he would take it out of next month’s rent. Which wouldn’t help because we were behind again for the next month! Over the years, we have switched roommates constantly because they were fed up of his financial situations. I even offered to pay an extra $50 a month on top of the amount agreed on for renting a room. We have grown close over the years to the point like family.

Now, he drives Lyft and makes about $100-$200 a day and pays the rental fee. Keep in mind the rental fee is like $200 and he drives 7 days a week. I also recently started a full time job where I work from home and only make $1 more than my last job.

It’s like every month he asks me to let him borrow money or my debit card. Just two weeks ago he asked me for the last $20 I had, yes, he paid me back the same day but I had to use my credit card for that. One month ago he asked me to pay my rent early again literally ONE week after we just paid rent because he was behind on something. One time he called me at work and asked me to let him borrow some money, I was at work and I was broke!!

Last night I come home and he asks to borrow my debit card and he was going to pay me extra and I just snapped! I told him my finances are not for me to take care of him, it for really nasty he said I was being selfish and a bitch...lol

I told him months ago to set up an extra bank account (not a prepaid bank account but a BBVA/Simple account) and he is too lazy to do it!!

So, am I the asshole for not letting my roommate borrow money or my debit card like I normally do? Did I overreact?

TLDR; my roommate asked me to borrow my debit card and offered to pay extra for letting him (after 8 years of doing so) and I snapped and said no and it resulted into in argument."
136,e6vbmy,"AITA for refusing to volunteer on Christmas morning? This Christmas my (28F) family is keeping things pretty low key - donating the money we would normally have spent on gifts for each other and only having immediate family over for dinner. My mum and her partner also asked me and my siblings if we would volunteer with them serving breakfast to the homeless on Christmas morning. The issue is the organization they are volunteering with is highly religious and has an extensive history of homophobia. 

I declined to participate as I strongly disagree with this organization's views and felt that by volunteering, it was like giving tacit approval to these views. I have not passed judgement on anyone else volunteering for them - both my mum and her partner view it as simply supporting their local community and I can respect that. The local branch of this organization is not as blatantly homophobic as in other areas.

Since telling my mum my reasoning, she is endlessly giving me grief about my decision, to the point that I am considering just sitting out Christmas dinner. She keeps going on about how privileged and judgemental I am and I don't want to have to deal with it anymore. I have tried to convince her to choose another organization putting on a meal for the homeless at Christmas but she has refused. I don't want to spend Christmas alone, but I don't want to have my mother shitting on me all afternoon. AITA?"
137,d0a55v,"AITA for telling my partner they should be willing to work at a job they hate? My S/O and I have seperate finances, but we split all expenses down the middle, so we rely on one another to pay the bills. We're relatively poor; neither of us make enough to pay them on our own.

Since January, their job has significantly cut hours and they hardly make anything (think roughly 10-15 hours a week on average, just above minimum wage). They did not adjust their spending habits in response, and in fact, got credit cards to compensate. 

To their credit, they HAVE been applying to places online. However, after over half a year with no new jobs and thousands of dollars worth of credit card debt later, I've started pressuring them to do anything: fast food, temp agencies, places I know they'd get hired pretty much immediately.

This conversation has happened a few times, and each time they get incredibly upset and state that, ""you think you're worried, imagine how I feel,"" and that I should not expect them to work somewhere that exhausts them or makes them feel unhappy and miserable. They think my request is selfish, and inconsiderate of their feelings.

I, however, feel that someone needs to do whatever they can to make ends meet, and that they should find a job that pays now and worry about getting one they actually  like later. I think they're being immature and irresponsible, and I will admit, at this point I don't think whether or not they like the job matters anymore.

Does this make me the asshole?"
138,a15h7n,"AITA for being fwb with a guy going through a divorce? We've known each other for a year, but didn't become friends until a few months ago. His separation was already in full swing, he had moved out like 6 months ago, but as far as I know there haven't been any official documents signed. So he asks me out in September, and the day before we're supposed to go on a date his ex mother in law dies. She had been suffering from cancer for a while, so it wasn't a surprise. So we don't go on the date, and we don't talk for a few weeks because he's supporting his ex, which involved moving back in with her for a couple weeks and then separating all over again. 

Cut to a month later, we hang out as friends and we end up hooking up. It's super fun and super casual. For about six weeks we've been seeing each other on the weekends, talking a lot, and just having a good time. I don't want him to be my boyfriend because there's no future there. Right now I'm in a limbo year, and hanging out with him is really fun, and I like our friend-sex dynamic. 

However, he still meets up with his ex on a weekly basis to ""support"" her. Last night he tells me that it's really hard because he doesn't love her, but her mom just died and they were together for like 10 years, so they meet up every now and again to talk and be there for each other. The first few times I understood, it was day of the dead, his parents were in town and wanted to see her, but this last time there was no major reason to see her. Now, I completely understand that the death of her mom is a big deal, going through a divorce after a 10 year relationship is also a big deal, so I understand him seeing her. However, he's definitely leading her on, he tells me that she still has hope they'll reconcile whereas he doesn't want that to happen. I asked if she knew about me, and he said no... I was just like... okay, you do you. I don't really feel like it's my business to tell him that he's being a dick to her. 


Am I the Asshole for continuing to see this guy? Part of me feels like I'm the other woman and I keep imagining how hurt she'd be if she found out... but I don't even know her. The other part of me feels like break ups are hard and people can still be friends after they break up, and it's normal to be supportive when someone dies. The last part of me feels like the sex is really good and none of it is really my business. So what do you think?"
139,cfef1s,"AITA for taking “away” my games? In advance, sorry for any errors as I’m on a mobile. 
For some background info, I was decent friends with this “e-girl” who is from a different country on a console for around a month before we started “game-sharing” so we can play the same games together. Fast forward to today, which is 6-7 months into the “friendship”
 we’ve drifted as people who have nothing to talk about anymore do, and I decided to giver her a advanced heads up that I’d be taking my games “back” and to download anything she needed or set up her own access to the consoles live system as she didn’t ever pay it. (The game share is now for my best friend who just got a new console) I received no reply for three days. Even though she read it. The moment I changed it (one hour ago) she proceeded to call me slurs and tell me I’m a “fake”.  Saying that I still have hers (I never did as she didn’t play anything I enjoy, such as FPS) and berating me until she blocked me.

140,cki04g,"AITA for not going to church with my family on my mom's birthday My parents and brother were coming to visit for my mom's birthday, and her birthday wish was that we all go to church together. I told her I'd think about it and I honestly did.

So context: Growing up we went to church and as soon as we exited the building and got in the car my dad would start up his emotional abuse as usual. So for me church didn't fix anything. It didn't make me feel good and it felt worse going with a two faced asshole (dad). And to add gasoline to the bonfire, I'm gay and closeted. 

Back to the story: As soon as my family got to my house dad started with his usual bs and its then I decided, no I'm not going to church with them. On Sunday morning my mom was crying and dad was throwing glares and sarcastically saying ""thank you""

They went and came back then went on as if nothing happened. I forgot about it until my brother threw it in my face again a couple of days ago.

141,ach6h2,"AITA for not wanting to move in with my partner currently Important context here:

Dating for over a year now, long distance (we live an hour away from each other) but we always plan our next adventure when either myself or my partner are ready to sadly go to the airport. I love them to bits, they aren't perfect and neither am I, but that's why we go together. 

So, into the details here. My partner has slowly been hinting at wanting to find our own place someday, which, I find is great! Cool! But, whenever we have a discussion about the actual logistics about it all, and I discuss what I think is quite important in getting a place: money, steady work, etc they get incredibly upset and believe I'm putting barriers up in not wanting that? Which isn't the case entirely, I'm just trying to consider, well, what we need to consider? I am not afraid of the commitment here, I just want to make sure these things are discussed. I think it's a big thing? 

It seems like we can never have a mature discussion about it and they just think that getting a place is simple. So, I was fully honest and mentioned I'm not at all comfortable moving in with them or getting a place until we have discussed things like rent and that whole process and.. Boy. Did they get upset. They were incredibly unfair and harsh in their wording with particular things and reacted in an incredibly immature way. Am I the asshole for being honest here? 

I was not harsh in my wording, I wasn't blunt or rude, I was being politely honest in how I felt about everything. I felt these are really important things to discuss and it felt like I wasn't heard or even understood. 

Now I'm sat in a coffee shop on my own at the moment trying to figure out what the hell to do here. I told them we need to talk about it again when we've cooled off, but I can't help but think that I wasn't listened to. 

If more context is needed I'll be happy to try and help, thank you.

142,cusibn,"Aita ex and apartment So, my ex and I are on good terms, at least. So I thought. We had our ups and downs in friendship. Thought he was over it. (Also I obviously now realize how stupid it was to assume him even mentioning having a place together was a good intention. So please don’t bring that up and that I’m stupid for even considering it)



Well, I am moving to a new city, different state and all, and before I even told him he said he was going to be going to the college I’ll be living right around the corner from (closest to where he lives now. It’s a state over but only a short drive) after I told him, he said ‘well why don’t we become roommates! You have cats, I’m going for veterinary assistant so I can help with their care and it’ll be cheaper for both.’ So my naive mind was like ‘ok, but it won’t be till new year anyways, so if anything we got time’. Ok whatever, all is well. 

Well, I am not wanting a relationship at all, he knows this. I have Reiterated it MANY time just to be certain he understands. 

So being courteous I explain that I won’t bring any of my hookups to the apartment when we do get it as long as he does the same. And it was like a freaking record screech. He went off, explaining that I know he still loves me, he can’t believe I’d be doing that and on and on.

I wanted to be nice but, am I the asshole for even mentioning that I’d obviously be having sex since I’m a single 21 year old? Btw he’s like 22 I think (I forget all the time)

143,dh49n0,"WIBTA If I stopped talking to a 14 year old after she refused to reconsider a costume? To start this off, I want to point out that Im half Native American. I wasnt raised on a reaervation but I reconnected with my tribe a few years ago and its sad to say that Im one of the richest people who regularly visits the tribe with only $2K in my savings. Ive seen the poverty, Ive donated as much as I feasably can to my tribe without compromising my own lifestyle, and it eats me up inside knowing that I'm fortunate enough to not be stuck there like some of them are. 

I also want to say I'm not asking if I'm an asshole for requesting a 14 year old to reconsider her costume. I'm asking if I'm an asshole for responding to her rejection of my request.

Anyway, onto the post. A friend of mine posted on FB a day or so ago looking for some used Halloween costumes for her kids, a perfectly reasonable thing to do. That's when I discovered that her 14 year old wanted to go as an ""Indian princess"", and having seen the poverty in my own tribe, I was very deeply offended. I talked to my friend, who basically shrugged me off and said to talk to her 14 year old, so I did. I explained that the costume was damaging to real Native Americans and would only add to an already horrifically oppressed group of people but she also shrugged me off. I continued and told her everything about what I'd seen in my tribe (she knows I'm half) and did kinda go on a tangent/semi-hysterical rant about how its cruel and selfish for her to wear a costume that was derogatory to half of my ancestry and the people that settled this land before her. She told me that it ""didnt matter now"" and she wasnt the only one doing it so what did it matter. 

I told her that if she went through with wearing the costume, I would cease to let her use my old sports equipment and I would not talk to her any longer because I wasnt the only one talking to her so what did it matter.

144,bgzbt5,"AITA for parking in both of my designated parking spots TL;DR at bottom
I live in an apartment complex and everyone gets two designated parking spots, both right next to each other. These are for your personal vehicles/friends/family. Say you own one vehicle and want two friends to come over: One friend parks in your second spot while the other parks in the street. Recently a new tenant moved in upstairs and her two parking spots are adjacent to mine. Lately shes been having people coming over and when they run out of space, they park in both of my spots while I'm at work. When I come back I have nowhere to park and have to go in the street. I've told her several times that we each have two spots and if those get filled her friends need to park in the the street, not my spot. Several times I've invited friends over and sure enough shes got her friends parked in my spot. I'm assertive but I'm definitely polite about it and each time I ask her to get her friends to move she gets upset with me. I've recently started to park in both (imagine these  | | |  as parking spaces, my car is on the center line but not blocking anyone from their own space) spaces but I move my car to just one when friends and family come over. this morning I overheard the landlord talking to my apartment manager about how I'm parking like an asshole.
Am I being immature and territorial and should just get over it?

TL;DR- My neighbor keeps parking in both of my spots causing me and my friends to park in the street. After talking to her about it a few times, she kept doing it so I started parking in both of my spots to stop her and this morning my landlord was calling me an asshole for parking like that.

145,dnyzhj,"AITA for Using Self Checkout? Every week I go food shopping for my family at my local ShopRite. Most times it’s under an hour and quick and I usually don’t go on Sundays because it gets extremely crowded, but for some reason (last week) I went food shopping on Sunday. This time I went, it was much longer. There were crowds of people in the lines, isles, and deli. I was fed up. After I finished the shopping I had to pay. One look at the lines told me that it was going to be a long wait, so I went to self checkout. There is no limit to how many items you can have at self checkout, but there were also express checkouts for people with under 20 items. Looking at my cart, I realized I had around 35 items, so I went to self checkout where there was no line. I started ringing up my items as usual, and I was about half way through when I look up to see a line forming around the self checkout. Quickly realizing that they were waiting for me, I started ringing and bagging at a faster rate, which led to errors upon errors. You know, the stupid “place item in bag” even though it was already in the bag type errors. The clerk had to come over five times for the store login to get rid of the errors. Then, a lady starts yelling at me for taking to much time.

“Do you know you’re holding up the line?” “Shouldn’t you be in the regular checkout” 
“I have places to be”
“Hurry up (swear words)”

She did that for a solid five minutes. Wanting her to be gone, I said nothing and finished packing. To my shock, the rest of the people waiting said nothing to me, it was mostly her. When I finished and she came up, my bags weren’t off of the bagging area. I wasn’t finished putting them into my cart. She still yelled at me. Now that I was done, I said “are you serious? You couldn’t even give me a minute to pack my things away? Why are you in such a rush to the point where you can’t even give me an extra minute?”

She said, which still shocks me, “I have to get to my hiuse to watch the football game!”

“You verbally berated me for five minutes, so you can get back to your house and watch the football game? Your crazy!”

She then yelled at me and how I “formed a line and a scene” because I couldn’t be patient and go to the regular checkouts. The final word I said was “You couldn’t even give me five minutes to bag, maybe you should learn some patience.” 

So my question is, Am I the Asshole for going to self checkout to avoid a wait and get home even though I had numerous items to purchase?"
146,croqop,"WIBTA if I let the groomer pay all $600 of my dog's vet bills? This situation is still currently unfolding. I went to bring my 11 year old dog to the groomer's because she is getting very fluffy. The weather is getting hot and I can tell she is uncomfortable - even in air conditioning. I dropped her off at the groomer's at around 8:30am and got a call at around 11am. I have never been to this groomer but have heard nice things about her.

The phone call stated that she had tried to ""jump off"" the grooming table and cut her leg. They said she was very squirmy and would not stay on the table appropriately. I asked how bad it was and she said she's not sure how bad, but the groomer had rushed her to the local vet.  I assumed that it would be bad enough that she had to rush her to the vet.

On my way, I was fuming. I was fully prepared for a confrontation, because how on earth could this happen?  The way that they were saying she was ""squirmy"" indicated to me that they were going to try and weasel themselves out of this situation. I specifically told them to call me if she was being difficult in any way, as I was not too far away. I calmed myself down because I did not want to go into this situation with complete negativity. I was ready to hear the groomer out on her side of the story.

When I got there, she explained that the dog had backed up too far off of the grooming table and her back end slipped off. As she slipped, she cut her leg on the scissors that were laying down on the grooming table. The cut did not tear any tendons or ligaments and the prognosis was good. Although, the bill was $600.

The groomer was extremely nice and offered to pay the entire thing. Normally, I would offer to pay at least a portion of it. I have just gotten a new job, and have not gotten a real paycheck yet. Financially, I am not able to afford this bill because of the timing - so I just kept my mouth shut and did not offer to pay any portion of it. On top of this, the groomer was extremely nice and apologetic. I felt really bad! Accidents happen, and my mind switched from wanting to rip her a new one to completely sympathizing with her.

I am picking up my dog at around 5pm after she gets stitches and from there, they will charge the groomer's account for the expenses.

Would I be the asshole if I let her pay the entire bill? Should I offer to pay a portion of it? Should I send her money in the future when I am financially stable?

TL;DR: My dog got cut while at the groomers. The groomer was extremely nice and apologetic. She offered to pay the full $600 in vet bills and I did not offer to pay any portion of it. Would I be the asshole if I let her pay the entire thing?

&#x200B;

EDIT:  I failed to include a piece of information! The groomer is hired by a boarding kennel, and the owner of the business is not her. She is hired under another woman who, in my mind, would have to pay the expenses because it is her business. It seems to me that the groomer herself is paying it out of pocket."

She's a lovely woman and our relationship is unlike any other, but when nobody else is there, she just makes me question. I can no longer trust her and I'm afraid to show emotion in front of her. Am I an asshole for trying to distance myself from someone who makes me feel like shit?"
148,c7khw1,"AITA for jabbing at a friend's insecurity because he wouldn't listen to me? So I have a friend that I play videogames with frequently. He's not bad at the games, but he does lose often. And when he does, he'll ask for a handicap. In Smash or any other fighting game for example, he'll throw his controller when he loses and get personally mad whenever anyone calls him out for being immature.

We were playing an open world game today, and I find out he's been cheating his way to the endgame and leaving us in the dust. I calmly say I don't want to play with someone cheating and leave. He texts me and gets extremely angry, saying I'm a righteous asshole for not wanting to play with him, and ignoring his offers to cut it out (because I was busy telling him why I'm not a fan of it). He begins to throw a pity party and says he wants to just play god and watch other people have a good time.

Because he was insistent on defending his cheating, I tell him that ""Cheating is bad. I think you'd learn that by now."" He cheated on his girlfriend a few months ago and it cost him his relationship. He called me a bad friend for bringing it up, and while I regret saying it, I truly believe it was the only way to cram it into his thick skull."
149,an2tqw,"AITA for being annoyed that my friend made us miss our train Ok, 2 of my buddies from college came to visit/stay with me. They wanted to go into the city (i live in the suburbs), so get into the city from where i live, you have to take the train into the city and then transfer to the subway to get around within the city. No big deal, I was fine with that. So we went into the city, went to a fun bar, and had, in general, a very enjoyable night.

THEN, on the subway back to get our train, we decided that we would just catch whatever train heading back to my hometown that happened to be leaving next (that late at night they usually leave about once every hour). one of my friends, we'll call her Emily, mentioned to me that she kind of had to pee. I told her that's fine.

We get to the train station, we find out that there's a train we'd be able to make by about 5 minutes. As we're speed walking there, Emily is now freaking out about needing to pee. I ask if she can just pee on the train (the trains have bathrooms), a question which she does not answer, and instead just ditches me and my other friend to find a bathroom.

We miss the train by about a minute because me and my other friend didn't want to leave without Emily. Literally watched the train pull away as Emily walks over. Naturally, we were both kind of annoyed by the whole situation. It was late and we all just wanted to go home. My other friend and I started to call Emily out a little bit. ""You could have peed on the train, why did you have to be annoying about this whole thing"" etc. which she FREAKED OUT about, exacerbating the entire situation, and while both of them were arguing, she was almost to the point of tears, specifically because she thought we had no right to be annoyed with her.

Emily's defense she gave later was that a) had we arrived 5 minutes AFTER the train had already left the entire situation would not  have even ensued because we didn't have a definitive train we wanted to catch until we got there, and that b) she was on a train once where the bathroom was locked, so she didn't want to ""risk"" getting on the train. I think the logic on both of these kind of fall in on themselves, but i guess I get it. Anyways. Am I (and my other friend) the asshole here for being pissed she made us miss our train?

&#x200B;

TL;DR my friend made us miss our train back really late at night, got very mad at us for being annoyed about it."
150,cmmxpo,"AITA for not wanting to watch my friends kid so she and her boyfriend can take their other kids to the movies. I have this friend that I met (known less than a year) through work (at a job I no longer work at) and she and her boyfriend have 4 kids between the two of them. They don’t have the greatest relationship (he’s cheated, he’s disinterested in being a partner or a parent, etc), her family lives 2 hours away and his father consistently hits on her and she doesn’t want to deal with it ( I get it). My husband and I have no children (by choice at the moment)  and I usually do not mind hanging out with my friends and their kids ( sometimes) but hers are a whole different level.   She texted me at about 4 pm today asking if I could watch their one year old ( who has been running fever of 100-104 off and on for a while and screams bloody murder when she leaves the room) while she takes his daughter and their three  year old to watch a movie either tonight or tomorrow. 
This is not the first instance either and I’m starting to get really tired of doing it/being asked. She couldn’t take him to daycare because he was sick, and since I’m between jobs she asked me if I would watch home so her boyfriend (who never misses work for their kids being sick) and her could work (she is able to work from home). I have many examples like this and it’s getting hard to nicely tell her I don’t want to watch her kids or come up with excuses.

Personally though, my experience with these things are a hit or miss, and I REALLY prefer they don't. Problem is they do it anyways, and the only way to get them to back off is honking at them.

152,aqj315,"AITA for not letting friends of my friends stay at my moms' place? Usual disclaimer, I'm on mobile so sorry about the formating and english not my first language.

For a little background, in my hometown, there is a fairly famous four day festival that I go to every year with the same friend group from this town. But I study in a different city and have some friends there as well. 

One of those friends from uni, let's call him Jimmy, is going to this festival this year too. When he told me about it, I offered our guest bedroom because maybe he'd like to shower or something during the festival. I know him well and my mum would be fine with it. 

Now at this point I thought that Jimmy would come along with us. Then he asked if he could bring another friend of ours and if that friend could sleep in out guest bedroom too. Since I know that friend well I said yes. 

Now, this friend is not coming anymore because of work. And Jimmy has asked if he could bring two other people to stay at our place for the festival. I've met them a couple of times, but I don't particularly like them. I understand that Jimmy wants to have people at the festival that he knows and can hang out with other than my friends (that he doesn't know). But I feel uncomfortable with his friends staying in our guest bedroom. The room would fit them all. I don't think that they would behave badly and that it would be a big deal though.

I told Jimmy that I don't like the idea of having his friends stay at my mums place because I don't know them well. My mum is only okay with having people over that she doesn't know if I trust them to behave and if I know them, which is very generous in my opinion. I don't want to take advantage of this, therefore I'm not going to have them stay here. 

Jimmy was not happy about it and thinks I have double standarts. He won't stay at my place if his friends can't come along and thinks that I'm ruining his festival. Now I don't think I'm being unreasonable but I'd still like to hear if I'm in the wrong here. Am I the asshole?

153,dh3ecy,"AITA for not wanting my stepmother to show up at my graduation party? 
My mom and dad divorced two years ago and my dad already got a girlfriend, i didn’t see the problem until she began being a two faced bitch to me and my sisters, she’s a totally different person when my dad is around, constantly making jokes about our insecurities for example when she said
 “wow I really thought you weren’t gonna pass your SATs since you aren’t really the study type”
 when my dad weren’t looking or when my sister got a ticket and she joked something about she being a bad driver when she’s just inexperienced and still really insecure about her driving yet 
(Again when my dad wasn’t looking) 
just for more context, earlier this year my sister graduated from college and my dad invited her without her consent, and it was a really awkward situation, we’ve talked to my dad about it and he learned his lesson and promised that he wouldn’t invite her without asking us first.
So now I’m graduating high school and my dad casually commented on how he already bought all invitations from my graduation, and when he said he bought for his girlfriend too I was (of course) really angry and said that I don’t want her there, are the end he said that I was being really rude for making him unninvite her and that I should apologize later for “not being able to endure her presence”

We basically do the same job, and have similar responsibility at work, and home.  Our kids are in middle abd high school, so they are pretty self sufficient, but still enjoy being around us. 

The issue is that my wife has at least 1/2 a bottle of wine after work every night, and likes to do happy hours on Fridays.  I dont have a problem with someone having a glass of wine or a beer every now and then but when she drinks. Its drink and go to sleep, leaving me to handle all of the household responsibilities. Last night she went out drinking with her friends like she has the last 2 weekends, because she needs tome to relax, while im here at home making dinner and doing laundry. She comes home about midnight and she continues her party with the friends.  They were loud enough that they woke our son up. He complained to me that they were throwing nerf darts at him when he went downstairs after being awoken. 

Its now 630 pm the next day and she has been asleep since about 2 am except for 40 minutes when i brought her to get her car. This has been the norm for about the last month. Am i being unreasonable to expect her to slow down with the drinking?

156,an88c5,"AITA for refusing to cook food for my Super Bowl Party? Yesterday I hosted a Super Bowl party, it was a rather large party (around 20 guests). Everyone offered to bring something ranging from appetizers to desserts. People seemed to put in a lot of effort for their dishes. While it wasn’t a fancy affair, it was nice to see the level of commitment my guests put forth. Here’s where the question comes into play. One of the guests (on their way to the party) stopped at a local grocery store and bought a frozen appetizer, with the intention of me cooking it for them.  They had volunteered to bring said item (they just left out the detail that the item would be uncooked). All of the other food was already prepared and I was ready to just relax and enjoy the party with my guests. Needless to say (and maybe I over reacted) but I flat out refused to cook the food. I said it was rude to bring a dish with the assumption I would just cook for you. Given that this wasn’t the first time said guest pulled a stunt like this (bringing salad material for me to put together), I was just not having it. I told them they can make it themselves if they care that much.   (Which they begrudgingly did)

AITA here?"
157,euplva,"WIBTA if I moved by myself? I (f25) live in an apt. with a classmate (m21) and my best friend (f25).

Me and my best friend met when we both moved into 4 bedroom student apt. 4,5 years ago. We became instant best friends based on our ethics and interests and became inseperable. After 3 years we moved to the capital as she got a job here and I started a BA degree in library science. 

The first year we lived in a 2 bedroom apt. and things went well, but she was negative to my new friends as she couldn't relate to them. She always had strong opinions on people and she likes being in control of her environment. I've respected this from the beginning and I've let her do what she needs to feel comfortable in her own home so I let her know who came by and when. 
I might add that she's high sensitive, so she doesn't like strong physical sensations. 

Last summer we had to move. In the capital everything is expensive, so we asked a classmate to move with us so we could afford a 3 bedroom. We asked several people, but they've told me later on they made excuses as they didn't want to live with her. 
Soon after we moved the guy got a girlfriend, so it's basically just been me and her living here. He's going to move in with his gf in august, so we've found someone who'll probably take his place.

However, the last summer took a toll on me and my bf. I was underpaid and broke, and the hunt for an apartment was tough. In addition, 3 people died. I knew them, but she was closest to them.

Life in this apartment has been more of her grudgingly accepting the few people who wants to visit me. Many are uncomfortable around her. Lately I've become uncomfortable too. She'll tell me I'm an awful person who ruins her entire day if I'm too negative. I can't give her critique if it's not put in the gentlest of ways, but she will lash out at me for suggesting a nice afternoon out of town, as I should know she doesn't have the energy for that. 
I'm not allowed to talk to her if I play music at 10 am on a sunday, and she keeps bringing tinder matches into our home for first dates even though I've said I'm uncomfortable with it.

I've considered moving, but she wants us to live together forever. I know that I affect her negatively as I start brooding if I can't express myself without negative feedback. I love her and I feel our friendship is hurting, so I'd prefer to move away before it becomes unmendable. 
But if she can't find someone to replace me, she'll risk having to move again, and having trouble finding a new place to live is probably very bad for her psyche. 
I'll finish my studies in 1,5 years and will probably move wherever I find work, so WIBTA for putting her in the situation of risking another apartment hunt in half a year from now when I know how terrible it will be?

Tldr; Me and my best friend have gone through shit together, but she's not treating me well. WIBTA for moving by myself with the possibility that she needs to move again, even though moving last summer was awful?"

159,cf8pb1,"WIBTA for not inviting my dad to my wedding? Background story: my dad remarried when I was 14, and I moved in with him, my stepmother, and her five kids. At the time my mom was an alcoholic and dealing with serious mental health issues, and I was dealing with some trauma and not “the best” teenager. 

However, my stepmom continuously put me down for years- comparing me relentlessly to her perfect five kids. Overall making my life very hard. Major depression in my teens. Thankfully I am now a super well adjusted, happy adult. My dad ignored the bullying from her, not wanting to get involved and jeopardize either relationship.

When I moved out at 17, I ceased all contact with her and am much better for it. My dad has only been in contact with me over the phone since. I am now 26- the last time I saw him I was 18 or 19. My uncle (his brother) thinks he abandoned me and they have fiercely defended me.

I am getting married next year and my uncle offered to walk me down the aisle- which is exactly what I want. I am inviting most of my dads family, and I don’t know whether to invite just him (not my stepmother), and have him watch my uncle walk me down the aisle, or if I should just accept that we have no real relationship and not invite him. I don’t know what to do, we have talked over the phone and I feel like not inviting him at all basically pulls the plug on my illusion of him still being my dad. Also it will be very weird for his family coming that don’t know the details of it. I think my grandmother will have a literal meltdown if her son is not there. I don’t know what is worse, inviting him and taking away all “dad” privileges or just not inviting him altogether.

Side note: extra painful because he is an AMAZING dad to his step kids.

Edit for clarity: He is not a bad man, just a very very very absent father. Leaving a lot out because it got my original post blocked my mods. But long story short- good guy, just has made no effort to be present in the last ten years. I think he is afraid that the sour relationship between me and his wife would cause a lot of issues, so he chooses ambivalence. Sucks more to me because he knows my mom can’t parent, so I’ve been parentless all of my adult life."
160,eegl7c,"WIBTA if I told my mom that my dad cheated on her multiple times in the past? TL;DR: dad confessed he’s been cheating for many many years but stopped. Has zero regret and expects me to just take the news like nothing. Not sure if I should confess and break the family apart.

Umm I don’t even know how to process this so I’m going straight to Reddit.. my parents have been married for 30+ years and despite all the arguments, they’ve always stuck together through thick and thin. He treats my mom well and always lectures us to be good to her. I used to think I knew my dad very well, he confides in me as he feels we’re very alike in personality.. something I used to be proud of. He favors me over my sister and overshares many details about his past. Just now while tipsy, he told me he has had multiple affairs that ended about two years ago, that it began even before he married my mom. He told me he has no remorse or regret; ALL men are apparently “programmed” like this according to him. I was so disgusted by how he said all that so nonchalantly.. He mentions that women need to always keep up with their appearance in order to keep their partners. I’m in shock. Growing up, I’ve always looked up to him and admired how hard he worked to provide for us. A lot of people see our family as the perfect example of love and commitment. I know my mom would be devastated if she knew. There’s no doubt that this family would crash and burn.. my sister would likely never speak to him again, their relationship has been strained from the beginning. I just hate that he told me and gave me all that weight to bear, as if it’s nothing. He laughed when I told him how I felt and says it’s all in the past, he’s not like that anymore. He sees me as his best friend, and I see now that we’re not alike at all. I don’t want to be anything like him. If I spilled the beans, he will hate me for it. But what am I supposed to do? Be the bearer of bad news and break the family apart? Or pretend nothing happened and keep everyone together? I want to tell my sister, but I’m afraid of the repercussions.

162,bbhk20,"AITA for calling in noise complaints So I live in an apartment complex with thin walls. I can hear everything. I normally don’t mind when it’s like normal living sounds like walking or closing a door, but my upstairs neighbors are absolutely obnoxious. 

Every night between 11 pm and 3 am they bang really loudly on their own doors. I have absolutely no clue why they would do that but the sound of a door being banged on is pretty recognizable. I tried to think if it was something else but the sound couldn’t be anything other than an extremely loud knock. 

Every Saturday morning they have a cook out (hot dogs at 8 am? Not sure why but who am I to judge) they do this right outside my window and blast loud music. I never call in a noise complaint on Saturdays because I couldn’t bear the thought of making their family go back into their house and ruin their fun, so I’d just put a pillow over my head and try to sleep. 

Every Sunday now for about three or four weeks they’d start construction on their bathroom which happens to be right above my bedroom. This construction consists of loud power tools and hammering. What time did they start this? Every Sunday at 5:45 AM sharp. By the third Sunday I had had enough, I worked until 1 am the night before and didn’t get to go to bed until around 2:30 because I had some cleaning I needed todo. I called in a noise complaint to the front desk and they were told to not start construction again until a reasonable time for most people to be awake on a Sunday. They interpreted that as 6:15 am! And continued. 

I think they know I called the complaint because when they saw me coming to the elevator a couple days later they quickly closed the door and wouldn’t let me in. They must have been pretty upset. I am only reminded of that because tonight at around 11:40 pm they decided it was a good time to vacuum their whole apartment. 

Now I feel I ruined a relationship with a neighbor

Now that school's in again I work part time on school days but full time on days without school (I cant work weekends as my job's not open then). Work is closed for xmas, and I took Thursday and Friday off because my mom said she wanted to spend time with me over the holiday. I'd honestly rather be at work. Not just because money, but because my coworkers make me feel good about myself.   
My soon to be step dad is visiting (trying to get green card so he can't stay for long) he's here for three months. His daughter is here only for the week because she has work in another state.   
I told mom on Dec 1st what days I was taking off. Plenty of time for her to make plans or tell me that won't work so I can arrange it with my boss etc...

Last night mom and I had a fight about plans. She says Im the ass because I didn't take the full week off knowing SS was coming (we originally thought she couldn't, but then she was able to, and we only knew about it half way until xmas). Mom didn't tell me I needed more time or anything since SS was able to come now so I thought it was all good to work Monday and Tuesday. Mom knew my schedule but made plans for me AGAINST my schedule anyway, but mom says since it's Xmas we're supposed to spend time together and ""she's not wrong because family"" (I'll post a link to the rant I made about that if anyone wants to read it). So I've already changed my plans last minute for her complete lack of regard of my schedule despite the fact I purposely gave her lots of time so something like that wouldn't happen.

165,czas1c,"AITA for asking a junior to provide proof of death for their brother's passing? This junior has been at the firm for just over a year at this point, whilst working on my current client for about 3 weeks and despite consistent support and mentoring they've failed to turn in work and anything that they do turn in is work completed by others or of extremely poor quality. I had set up a meeting between myself, the junior and their direct manager/mentor, their counselling partner also agreed to sit in alongside HR. By no means was this meeting intended to be us slating the junior or intending to fire him, I had set it up with the full intention of understanding the reasoning behind the junior's lack of work and effort and if there was anything we could do additionally to support them. I personally had alot of issues at home when I first started which significantly affected my work and the firm went above and beyond to support me so I wanted to provide the same opportunity for this junior.


About 30 minutes from the meeting, the junior sends an email to us stating ""My brother has suddenly passed away and I will not be available for the coming few days."" We of course reach out and send our condolences and messages of support, however at this point the HR manager in attendance looks very annoyed and simply states that this all seems far too convenient. So after a little bit of discussion and investigation we note that whenever he has had exams, performance reviews or work deadlines coming up he is suddenly afflicted with personal bereavement.


Our firm is extremely lenient with compassionate/bereavement leave however in cases where we feel this is being abused we can directly ask for proof, this can be anything from an obituary, funeral programme or death certificate. I searched for obituaries and funeral programmes online to see if anything was coming up in the brother's name (I did this a few days after we were notified of the ""death""). Once I couldn't find anything and discussed with HR about requesting proof, I did exactly that. I emailed the junior with all relevant staff CC'ed in requesting some degree of proof for their bereavement.


The junior responded in a very attacking manner stating they shouldn't have to provide proof and I was being extremely disrespectful, they decided to CC in all of the other juniors. This issue has left people quite divided on how it has been handled with some saying I was wrong and should always give someone the benefit of the doubt in these situations whilst others have agreed with my methods and stated that abusing the leave policy to get out of work responsibility should be punished.


AITA in this situation? I get it's a highly sensitive topic but the junior's actions have caused many issues for people he has worked alongside. I've of course made this post as vague as possible and changed some details around for privacy sake."
166,d4z570,"AITA for calling out my Father-In-Law for the way he speaks to his wife? 
I grew up in a very happy home. My parents are both mild-mannered, kind, extremely affectionate and giving. They were wonderful parents and as such we are all very close and I am very close to my siblings. One of the things I love and respect most about them as they get older is their unwavering support for each other. They are so kind and deeply in love and the result is that it’s given me fairly high standards for how people should behave within relationships.

I met my fiancé a few years ago and we have a young daughter. When I first met my fiancé it was his confident and funny nature that first attracted me to him. A trait I quickly realised he had inherited from his father. 
His father has many good qualities; he is confident, funny, charismatic, generous with his time and money and a doting grandfather. However he also has a side which I have grown to find unbearable. He is domineering, chauvinist (though in a subtle way that I have realised through the way he treats his wife rather than through the things he says), bossy, he berates his children, plays favourites and is nasty behind people’s backs and most of all he must have control of everything. My fiancé feels like in some ways he hardly has a relationship with his dad other than superficially as his dad is not much interested in anything but drinking and doing his own thing. He is definitely a functioning alcoholic.

One of the things I hate most about his dad is the way he speaks to his wife (my fiancé’s step mom). They have a baby and he still berates and bosses her around, swears at her sometimes. She mostly seems unaffected by it, she doesn’t argue or say anything but meekly does what she’s told. She is from an Eastern European country and as far as I can tell her culture is that women almost subservient.
I was super worried about my fiancé’s parents meeting my parents because my parents would be mortified for his wife. But when they met he was on his best behaviour. Which I also don’t like because I feel like he knows the way he behaves is wrong.

We were having a meal together a few weeks ago and we’d all had a lot to drink. He started shouting at his wife because something hadn’t been done to his standard. I sort of lost it and said it wasn’t her fault and she was the one looking after the baby, and that if he wants it done a certain way he should do it himself. Afterwards I apologised (because my fiancé asked me to as it’s not my marriage or my place to say anything) and it’s been smoothed over as his dad is not sensitive. 

I still feel pretty irritated by it and regret apologising and I said to my fiancé that I don’t really want to go around and witness it because it makes me uncomfortable. But he said that his dad and step-mom are happy how they are and that it’s none of my business. So, Reddit, AITA?

167,d9py93,"WIBTA for inviting my SIL and her family up for the holidays but not my FIL and step-MIL? A little background: my mother-in-law passed away just over 2 years ago. I was extremely lucky in that I had a wonderful relationship with her. I loved her very much, she loved me, and I miss her terribly. It was a very difficult time for my husband and sister-in-law, they were a very close family, so it's something they are still dealing with. 

My father-in-law got remarried very quickly, and he has now been married to his new wife for a year. She is...okay. She's nice enough, tries to be friendly with all of us, but she has a personality that just doesn't mesh well, and she has a habit of stepping on toes. She has tried way too hard to step into a ""mother"" role to my husband and SIL, and ""grandmother"" role to my SIL's kids, while they are still grieving the loss of their mom, so it has rubbed everyone the wrong way. There are a lot of other little things, like moving into their childhood home and getting rid of all photos of their mom without offering them to the kids, that have put a strain on that relationship. 

The other element at play here is that ever since he got remarried, my FIL has been very disengaged from our lives when he was once super involved. He doesn't call, doesn't make much effort to see his grandkids, and spends much more time with his new wife's kids and her grandkids. For the record, I don't think step-MIL is actively trying to push FIL to spend less time with us, it just seems that she dictates how they spend their time and he just goes along with it, so this is on him. This has been especially difficult on my SIL, who is tremendously hurt at how little her dad seems to care about her kids.

This all leads me to the holidays. The holidays have been very tough since my MIL passed away. Especially since step-MIL takes them VERY seriously. She's quite religious (Christian) while my husband, SIL, and I are all agnostic Jews. SIL's husband is agnostic as well. 

My husband and I are planning to spend the holidays out of state with my family this year. My mom suggested inviting my SIL and her family to join us, since she is aware of the circumstances and how difficult it would be for SIL to spend the holidays with step-MIL, especially without my husband and I there. I think it's a great idea, but WIBTA for not inviting my FIL and step-MIL? Step-MIL's kids and grandkids will be with her ex-husband this year, so part of me feels bad about potentially making them spend the holidays without anyone, but I've seen how difficult these past 2 years have been for my SIL and I want to help give her a fun, stress-free holiday. So, WIBTA?"
168,byks7c,"AITA for refusing to be a groomsman? 10 years of details I'm skimming over, but here's the general gist:  


In my early 20s, a circle of friends and I loved this fun, albeit immature, guy we'll call LI. He's a hyper competitive guy but always seemed extra fixated on challenging me. Said maturity and competitiveness got worse with each passing year.    


By our mid 20s, he got caught on this loops where he would repeatedly say, ""I'm going to bang your sister,"" ad nauseum. After I called him out on it in front of a bunch of our friends and thoroughly embarrassed him by reminding everyone how a guy he hated in high school was currently dating my sister, his immaturity and general shitty behavior went into overdrive.   


He PMd me on every social media account I had with, surprise, ""I'm going to bang your sister."" Outside of her romantic interests treating her with proper respect and care, I don't care about my sister's love life in the least. Don't know why he thought that line would get to me. But the creepiness, disrespect and immaturity was wearing thin.   


He seemed to come to his senses and asked me to come meet him at a bar to hash things out. I agree. His apology started out okay enough, but ""... so sorry about all that. But I'm going to bang your sister someday. You know that, right? I will."" (Narrator: He did not.)  


Then I  completely cut him out of my life. Told circle of friends never to invite me anywhere there's a chance he'd come. They obliged. Circle and I slowly grew apart. I'll never know how much was because of LI vs natural life flow.   


Five years after that, we have a chance encounter where he says we need to ""bury the hatchet"" and asks for my phone number. I give it to him knowing full well it's blocked and had no interests in undoing it. The next day at the same music fest, I spot him standing by himself in the wings, watching my every move for about 3 minutes. Fucking creepy.   


By happenstance, a mutual friend of ours, let's call him SB, that I'm still fairly tight with gets engaged. SB informs me he wants me both me and LI to be groomsmen and might make me best man. I thought about it for a week and then informed him there was no way in hell I would be in the wedding party or go to a bachelor party with someone that disgusts me. Sure, it's their day, but it's also my life.   


Understandably, SB and his fiance', who I'm also friends with, are pissed. However, SB decided at the last minute he was not coming to my destination wedding last year due to a ""lack of funds."" Sure, it was pricey and inconvenient as hell. No offense taken. However, he seemed to have plenty of funds when he went to a Vegas bachelor party a month before our wedding.   


SB and fiance' asked me to reconsider a few times now. I'm sticking with my decision. They haven't made theirs."
169,bns8e2,"AITA for showing my child proof of my husband's infidelity Throwaway because this is a delicate matter. Basically, my marriage of 15 years has finally ended when I got tired of my husband's cheating, emotional abuse, and gaslighting. The last straw was when he was fired from his job as a hotel GM for taking up with a staff member 25 years his junior (he's 52, she is 26). After being fired, I filed for divorce, and he moved out and took a job in another city.

&#x200B;

We have one child, my son who just turned 14. Though I have full custody, he has always worshipped his father (ironically, probably because his father was never around -- working super long hours -- and so craved his attention and approval), and he blames me for the divorce. Recently, he has directed all of his anger about the divorce at me, yelling and cursing at me, and blaming me as the cause of our broken family. 

&#x200B;

He asked what his father had supposedly done for me to file for divorce. His father has told my son that he didn't want a divorce, and that ""Mom is crazy"". I told my son that I had my reasons, but he didn't need to know them, all that mattered is that we both loved him and needed to be apart because we were making each other miserable. This wasn't enough for him, so he kept pressing me. Finally, in desperation, and because I felt it was untenable to live with my son if he thought I was the one who drove his father away, I told him the divorce was his father's doing -- that he had been unfaithful.

&#x200B;

My son asked for proof. I said he had to take my word for it, and he called me a liar, and said that his Dad was right, I was just crazy and vindictive. So I asked if he really wanted to see the evidence and he said yes. So I showed him pictures of his father and his young staff member dancing together, a birthday card he had received from her that I had found, and other similar items. Nothing racy or sexual, but tokens of affection and pictures of them together from her social media. Since then, my son has been withdrawn and refuses to speak with me.

&#x200B;

AITA for showing him the truth about his father? Or should I have kept it a secret even though his perception of events was damaging my relationship with him?"
170,d0em8r,"Aita ? Son's nickname turns into a racial misunderstanding Today I went grocery shopping and I normally do it at a WM superstore but today I decided I was too tired for long lines and decided to go to a local supermarket. I did all my shopping and it was a little more expensive but I was soo tired and ready to go home. I had a tired 5y/o past bed time and my husband who was in a hurry to go home for the gears (pre-order) release. So when I finished shopping i went to the shortest line which has a person just buying 3items, the cashier was a nice older African American lady (normally I wouldnt really state race as it doesn't matter, but this time it's important for the story) and she was extremely nice to us. as I was checking out, my husband placed the bags in the cart while my son looked at the candy at the front counter behind me, I paid and was ready to go so I said to the lady "" thank you, have a nice night"" and she replied to me ""you too"" and I turned around and called out to my son ""*Peter* (not real name) let's go monkey"" and my son stopped playing with the candy and ran to my cart. This is where I was completely oblivious. I normally call my son monkey, bug, chipmunk, or Taz (Tasmanian devil) so I didn't think anything of it I call him these name as his has ADHD so he's a sweet but over active child but never do I mean it in a mean way or anything nits always with love +my son is 1/4 Spanish 1/4 Mexican 1/2 white, and looks like a brown eyed white boy so really it's nothing racial. when we get to the car my husband says ""wow your such an butthole"" and I'm just confused as to what I did so I ask ""why ?!"" And he said ""that lady was so nice to us and you just offended her so badly"" at this point I was more confused and worried ""wait why??"" My husband: "" you called *Peter* monkey in front of her and she gave you the most dirty offended look ever! Why would you even do that???"" Me a little less confused but now confused for something different I asked ""wait why would she think that's offensive *Peter* isn't black he's Hispanic and yet he looks extremely white?"" He said "" why would you even say monkey in front of her?? she probably thought you called her that!"" At this point he's laughing at me me:""but I didn't!! I said it to *Peter*!???"" Husband: ""I know that, but does she?"" Me:""I seriously didn't!!"" Well the conversation kept going with him teasing me and so on even calling me racist for not being sensitive about the word in front of her... So am I an butthole for calling my son monkey in front of her? And am I an butthole if I think she is the one who took it wrong?"

172,bfev7s,"AITA for correcting my friends? Context: I live in Brazil. Thus English is not my first language. But the MEC institutes it as part of our curriculum (AKA we need to learn it. Basic subject, like Geography) which means people normally begin to learn English when they're 9. I began when i was ~5, a little bit ahead.

One day, we had a presentation. The first one fully in English. I read and re-read the text, checked my spelling, and i believed i was okay.

When i got there, everything began smoothly. I read my parts, tried my best not to fuck up in the pronunciation, nice and clear.
But when it was my partner's turn, he didn't know how to pronounce some words. I knew he'd spend hours trying every phoneme he could, so i helped him. (Because, you know, one doesn't simply figure out the pronunciation of a goddamn word)
And i helped him all along the presentation.
The presentation was over, he thanked me for the help, and we gave up the space to the next couple.

A week later, we recieved the grades for our presentation. It was supposed to be a couple grade, but he got 7, and i got a 6.5
When i confronted the teacher about it, he scolded me and said that i shouldn't give him the answers, and that i should let him remember what he learned.
I felt really guilty for correcting my partner, but also really pissed that i got a lower grade for trying to help.

I was talking about this to my friend when we were thinking about that year, and he pointed me to this sub, and that i should give it for other to judge, with no bias.

This year, like last year, Hanukkah comes before Christmas (if you didn't know the Jewish calendar is lunar so our holidays fall on different days every year, sometimes Hanukkah is during christmas, sometimes during thanksgiving, and everywhere in between).

I've always been kinda annoyed that Christmas gets treated as a multi-month holiday.  I roll my eyes at talk of ""war on christmas"" because some business just has a red holiday cup without a snowman on it,  and last year during Hanukkah in mid December, when people would wish me a merry Christmas as i was checking out at a store or buying coffee, i'd smile and say ""Happy Hanukkah"" and be on my way.

My sister studies in another city and has an appartment. I live at home with my parents. My sister is home for the summer. 

My bedroom is situated in the basement in the room next to the TV room. We also have a small tv in the kitchen and one in my parent’s bedroom. My parents are away for the week. 

My sister is on her ""only free week of the summer"" (she has two we’re going on family vacation first week of June.) 

I work during the week, 4 days a week. I wake up at 7 am so I have to be asleep by 11PM. 

Yesterday night she and her boyfriend (21M) decided to watch a movie. They came in the basement at 10:30 PM and started to browse for a movie. 

The light in the other room was on and both my boyfriend and I need complete darkness to sleep so I went to turn it off.  That’s when I realized they were there. So I explained to them that I needed to sleep very soon and if they could please turn the volume down. She rudely 
said 
“ok but imma watch a movie anyways"" 
I let it slip. 

Turns out their movie woke me up at around midnight and it kept my boyfriend awake for a while as well. 

So I politely messaged her to ask that she used the TV before 11:00 PM 

Here’s what I texted her. 
""""Hey, I don’t wanna sound too bitchy but this morning Simon told me your movie kept him awake a while. It also woke me up at around midnight.

I start my shift at 8:30 I grab my equipment and head to the first of 5 areas I clean. They are simple and quick to finish but I take my time with them as they are all I have to do for 8.5 hours. My co workers (3 of them) finish the other 4 areas, which admittedly are much more involved and tedious. This is a normal day but on some days, whomever makes the schedule (for some awful reason) gives me and one of my coworkers days off during the week and the other two weekends off, leaving myself and other guy to finish 4 peoples worth of work. I hurry on these days and finish as fast as I can but I am not the fastest person to begin with. I get a 30 minute lunch and 2 15 min breaks that I take everyday like everyone else. My coworker on the other hand didnt take his lunch or breaks and only clean the 2 big areas of the store while I clean 5 smaller areas. He tried raising his voice on me for not finishing my areas faster and helping him finish his areas and used not taking his breaks as a point of ""how hard he is working"" and ""I could clean this whole store by myself but shouldnt have to because you are here"" and ""you need to be much faster like me"" and ""time yourself to keep track of your time so you can be quick"".

I recently found out that my body can't deal with gluten very well, it's not very serious, but eating it will cause major diarrhoea (sp?) and intense cramps (sorry if it's TMI). 

So I started buying my own gluten free bread and pasta, sometimes even cookies. I'm in HS and only work weekends, so I don't have much money to spend, but I'm okay with doing it this way. Completely changing my diet would be a bigger hassle. 

Problem is that my mom eats it too. If she's too lazy to get bread from the freezer she'll eat mine. I would be okay with that if she replaced it, but it's happened several times that for breakfast she'd take the last few pieces. Leaving me to skip breakfast, or be late for school to go get more.

177,ct8w0a,"AITA for not shaving my legs for work? So I’m a 21 year old female. I feel like I should say these thing about myself because these are usually what people ask or say when they find out I rarely shave my legs. I’m straight, I’m very feminine, and I just don’t like to waste my time or money on shaving my legs. Also I’m not a hairy person at all! You can barley see my leg hair, arm hair or even my god damn eyebrows. The only time I shave is when I’m dating a new guy in my life and I’ve been with my current BF for 3 years now. Also he doesn’t give a rats ass if I shave my legs. 

So I work for a promotion company where I travel and work at event and festivals. But today I had to go into the office to grab some materials and my boss was there in his office so I stoped to say hi before I left out. 

When I ducked in he awkwardly asked me if we could talk about something. I said sure and came in and he shut the door. He was so red and stuttering but finally he told me we needed to speak about hygiene. I was in literal shock. I was so embarrassed and asked him what he meant. My boss then proceeded to tell me that a few people complained I didn’t shave my legs and they said it went against company policy that I wasn’t being hygienic. I was even more shocked. 

I told him I didn’t understand what that had to do with me shaving my legs and he was just absolutely quiet. I asked him if he shaved his legs and he still said nothing. I then stood up and said if we were gonna keep talking about this I’d prefer HR to be there and he just told me that we didn’t need to discuss it any further. 

Later today I just got an email from HR saying that they would like to set up a meeting for next week to talk further about the discussion that happened today. I’m freaking out and it’s making me so anxious.

178,bjw8cd,"AITA for refusing to donate my hair to my aunt with cancer? For context, I'm adopted and have super long & very thick red hair. No one in my adopted family has hair like mine,and it's been kind of a thing for them to touch, admire, & talk about my hair at family gatherings since I was a kid. My aunt has lung cancer, and it's really taken a toll on her. She's lost all her hair and has talked about getting a wig, but they're too expensive and she says she wants real hair. My mom suggested I donate my hair to make a wig for my aunt at Easter dinner, and my aunt got so excited she started crying. I felt horrible about it, and didn't say anything. We went to this wig place and the lady said she could make a shoulder length wig for my aunt using my hair. (I keep it up extremely well & it's down to my knees) My aunt started crying again and again I feel so awful, but I really don't want to part with my hair. I know it grows back but still.

No one had asked me how I felt, but I think my mom could tell I wasn't very excited about it because she asked the lady if she could donate her own hair, and she said she'd need both my sister (mom's biological daughter) and my mom to donate their hair, since it's very thin, and she could only make a chin length wig with it. My aunt also wants red hair, so the lady said she'd have to dye it & that would cause it damage & cost more than using my hair. My uncle then said it'd make much more sense to use mine.

It's been a month and my aunt wants to know when we can make the appointment. I don't know what to do. I told my sister and she called me ungrateful and told me to stop being selfish because it would grow back. If I'm TA I won't hesitate to donate it but I don't know anymore.

EDIT: People suggested I clarify, I have knee length hair & I'd have to cut all of it off to the scalp in order to make the wig.

To all the people saying it doesn't take that much hair to make a wig: it does. One average donation of hair doesn't make a full wig, they match it with other donations. It usually takes 2-3 heads of hair for a full wig. Mine is long enough on its' own for a full wig, and my aunt doesn't want synthetic hair mixed in to supplement it.
I completely understand everyone that said I was the asshole for not saying no in the beginning. I'm not trying to justify that, but I want to make it clear that it's extremely difficult for me to stand up to my family. I don't think I've ever had a say in anything since I started living with them, and that's how it's always been. They never give me a voice, even though I should have spoken up.

She describes it as her “personal journal” and that’s why it’s kept private and decided to block me from viewing the content on it. 

But today I found out that she actually blocked me because she decided that she would use the account to tell everyone about everything I do that she HATES and make fun of me. I got really upset and confronted her about it. 

Now, I will admit that in my anger I didn’t think this through completely and confronted her while she had a friend in the car. But to be completely honest, I wish that I had had one of my friends there, too, just so that I wouldn’t have experienced the immediate double team that I did. 

They both simultaneously began to lecture me about how I need to “respect her privacy” and not demand to be allowed to view these posts. I brought up how it seemed to me like she was just finding new ways to talk shit about me behind my back without me knowing which they both immediately began trying to refute. “Everyone complains about their siblings like this and blocks them from viewing it, Zooper, you have no right to be upset that you don’t get to see what she’s saying about you. This account is her own personal journal!” And after she dropped me off at home she apparently took to Instagram and posted about this fight on the account. Except this time, she gave out my personal account and told everyone to DM me their thoughts and my inbox was flooded with her friends telling me I was the world’s biggest asshole for not respecting her “private” Instagram, and she has stated that because I don’t believe in “privacy” it’s okay for her to have given out my account in a post that I couldn’t view just so that I couldn’t prepare for the onslaught of harassment. 

Everyone who messaged me went on and on about how this behavior is normal and healthy and that I have no right to harbor any anger towards her for it. 

I’d just like to end this by mentioning that I don’t care that she talks shit about me on the account, I’m just more angered by the fact that I don’t even get to see what these people are saying about me unless a mutual friend shows me a post like they did today.

In 2014 I joined them for thanksgiving (my whole family out of town, I stayed cuz I had too much hw from college so no issues there) and their 26 year old nephew from NYC joined us. From the moment he walked in he gave me a weird vibe. 

Anyways, at the time my phone had a corner “popping out” if that makes any sense, like I needed to take it somewhere to fix it so the screen would be even. I made a comment about it to me neighbor and this guy went “I can fix that!” Takes my phone and presses on it HARD, aaand my screen shattered (and mind you Im a broken college student living at home) he just gave it back to me “I tried” I was LIVID. His aunt was completely horrified. At this point Im like “leave it, dont make a scene at their house, we’ll have to deal with it later”. We sat at the table and his aunt goes “you know you have a job and should help her pay for the screen you shattered” he looked straight at me and went “yea, maybe in her dreams” WTF? WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? I didnt even ask for help! At the end I just left after dinner and was able to save some money and fix it myself. My family wasnt happy about it but we’re thankful I wasn’t rude to anybody. They simply asked me to be friendly to the guy for our neighbors.

Ever since, he messages me on fb or instagram at least once every couple of months. For the last 5 YEARS, he tries to get me to come to NYC, or his “art shows” in miami, etc. I never reply and he is always trying to play nice “hey I just wanna know how you’re doing” My neighbor is always saying he does that cuz they know he is attracted to me and feels guilty about what happened... and is not used to girls avoiding him. 

My friend thinks I should be civil and need to move on from what happened. But I just dont want to talk to him? I wont even go to my neighbor’s if he’s there. And my family dont want me to block him to avoid issues with his family. I told him years ago I probably would never attend one of his art shows, not interested but he is still messaging me.

I have known my friend for almost six years. He was my best friend for a really long time, and we knew virtually everything we could about each other. From the very start I had been very anti-drug and anti-alcohol and all that, especially since we are underage. The fourth year of knowing him, I had moved to a different country for a year. We occasionally chatted online, but neither of us were ever too much into texting. After coming back, I had noticed he treated me a lot different, and became really good friends with a complete asshole. I'm not just saying that because he changed my friend, just because his go-to joke was to beat you up. The thing that surprised me was that my friend actually seemed to find it funny. Over the course of the next 2 years, he kept becoming better friends with the asshole's friends, who were coincidentally bigger assholes. I wasn't left out or anything, mind you, I tried my best to just ignore the asshole and keep my friendship all ok. Fast forward to a month ago. Whilst walking out of school I try to catch up to him to tell him something (we walk seperate directions) only to see one of asshole's friends vaping. I ironically say ""That's very naughty"" to which my friend takes out a vape and ""rips a huge cloud"". My heart sorta dropped that second, seeing as we had loads of fun times calling people stupid for vaping and stuff back in the day. I held back tears walking home, however stupid that sounds. I stopped talking to him after that. Just completely cut him out.

This relates to around when our first kid was born and I'm going to try to make this short. We just moved from out-of-state and were living with my in-laws until we got our own place. I was overdue and induced. When we were on our way around 10 pm my MIL called saying she was on her way too. No biggie, it's her first grandchild so she's understandably excited. She decided on her own that she was going to stay with us overnight.

Fast forward to the next morning. I'm a pretty sentimental person and was going through some depressed feelings about having this baby. I was going to miss my alone time with my husband and wanted to spend some moments with only him. I'm not very outspoken so when MIL was in the bathroom I suggested to my husband that he ask her if she wants to go home to freshen up or eat breakfast or rest. Seriously nothing was happening still besides me laying in the hospital bed and having contractions that were super tolerable. He suggests it to her and she leaves, seemingly no problems.

About 15 minutes later we get a call from my brother-in-law and he sounded kinda pissed. He said that MIL called him bawling saying that we don't want her there and told her to leave. My husband had to call her and apologize and practically beg her to come back. She showed back up as if everything was normal and decided to stay in the room until I wanted my epidural. I wasn't allowed to have anyone else in the room, even my husband, when I was getting it but I learned after that she was going around saying that I kicked her out again. After it was done she came back in again as if everything was fine. Couple hours passed and baby was finally coming, for *months* I had emphasized the only person I want in the room was my husband. Yet again this woman starts crying when asked to leave. 20 mins after delivery there I am laying spread eagle on the delivery table and having my hoo-ha stitched up and bonding with baby, my MIL walks in. The meds finally start wearing off and I am pissed but still don't say anything. I spent the entire time worrying about her and making sure that I wasn't stepping on her toes.

I could probably write a book on shitty things that my MIL has said/done to me. Putting all that aside, this one is the main reason why I don't want her to know when I'm going into labor. My husband really understands why I feel this way and says it is up to me but I have to be ready for the consequences of my decision. She's always been over-dramatic and I don't want to be dealing with her when I'm supposed to be focusing on myself and the baby. I really don't want her to be there. WIBTA?

edit: thank you so much everyone for the responses! I definitely wasn't expecting this much feedback. 
Back when we were living with my in-laws I was severely depressed and felt like since they were sharing their home with us I didn't have a say in a lot and felt like I just needed to be grateful, so I didn't say a lot. We were paying weekly rent and buying groceries but I never felt comfortable there.
Now that we're in our own house my husband and I definitely feel like we're in a better place, both individually and in our marriage. For example, my MIL and BIL used to make shit up and put it in my head that my husband was cheating on me. My PPD was pretty bad because of them. I love my husband and he is also an amazing father. I tell him he's a closet Mama's boy but he just denies it over and over. He's chewed her out before though for stuff that she's said.
I've developed more of a spine now being on our own and realizing how much fucked up shit they put me through and put in my head. I'd honestly have no problem cutting them off but don't for the sake of my baby and husband's relationship with them. Stay tuned for my next post of AITA for cutting off my husband's family?

184,ddpe8o,"AITA for telling my stepmom to leave ‘the fucking room’ after her phone kept chiming when we were visiting our dying grandma? To keep matters brief I’m going to call my stepmom ‘mom’ because she basically is, but y’all need to know she’s my stepparent for the story. She raised me and I love her and she’s been an amazing mom but she’s emotionally draining in the same way all parents kinda are. 

My step grandma and I are really close. Like, really, really close. We both share personalities, interest, we even look alike, and both have the same physical build etc. Growing up I was so ‘connected’ with her. This caused some tension with her bio grandchildren and kids and over the years they’ve accused her of favoritism, me of ‘twisting’ grandma, etc. 

Grams is very very old and is about to pass away any day now. She has an oxygen tank, a nurse who stays with her at home, and the thing that breaks my heart the most is that her mind is completely as sharp as ever, it’s just her body that’s giving up. 

My mom and grams were never *close*, but since she’s been sick mom has been making a big effort to come see her. Yesterday I was sitting with grandma rambling total crap and mom came in furiously typing. It later transpired the texting was about me ‘usurping’ grams time because I’m always with her, and she was defending me, but in the moment her phone kept. Fucking. Chiming. 

Like every two seconds. And it’s that annoying Samsung jingle so it’s not a quick beep, and it just kept going and going.  I was already feeling pretty emotionally rough so I said ‘mom, put your phone on silent for gods sake’ but she went ‘no I don’t like it on silent’. 2 mins later another cacophony of jingles. Grandma didn’t look happy with the noise at all, she kept wincing because she prefers the quiet so I hissed to my mom ‘get out the fucking room mom if you won’t put your phone on silent’ 

She gave me a hurt look and left, and later on she burst out crying and kept saying that I didn’t need to fight with her in front of grandma. I feel completely shitty but also like she wasn’t respecting that my grandma needs quiet too."
185,ad7afe,"AITA for telling my wife that I won't allow our children to hang out my MIL's house? My wife and I are staying at her mother's house while we're shopping for a new home. 

My wife's brother is also staying at the house as he is jobless. He has mental issues and is being medicated to help control his anger. He's been mostly fine in the time we've been staying there but my wife insist that it's only because I'm there. He also has drug problems. He has pawned his PS4 4 times this past month and the MIL has brought it back from the pawn shop. No end to that cycle.

The MIL has a mild case of hoarding. There is random shit everywhere. We cleaned up the basement to make room for ourselves but goddamn, it's messy, dirty, but not horribly unlivable. 

We have numerous nieces and nephews on my side of the family. It's fairly normal when these kids are staying overnight at their grandparents or their aunt and uncle house. 

My wife and I are trying for a baby and the topic came up of whether or not we're going to allow our family to babysit our children overnight. I'm ok with my side of the family doing that, they all have kids, they're experienced and they're normal.

Her family, however, I won't allow our children to stay with them overnight (Except maybe her sister after some changes to be made). That was my firm statement to my wife. She was disappointed to hear that. 

Her mother's house is not a safe environment for children to stay, there's a drug user with mental issue staying there. It's a filthy place to stay. Her sister has a pair of dogs that I wouldn't leave young kids around without supervision, it also doesn't help when her boyfriend constantly drinks and leaves beer cans all over the place (I'm not talking 10 or so, I'm talking a garbage bag full of cans after cleaning up one time)

My wife said that it's possible that her mother can clean up, get rid of her brother and said the same for her sister. 

I believe that her mother is stuck in a cycle where she is enabling her son's drug habits (Who the fuck buys a PS4 4 times from a pawn shop?) and thinks that her house is perfectly fine. Her sister on the other hand, I can see some improvement but as I said, her family has ways to go to prove to me that they're capable of taking care of little kids.

tldr; wife's family is fucked up, I told her I won't let our future children stay with them"
186,aty0jm,"AITA for rudely rejecting him? I'm doing my MS at the same uni that I did my undergrad in. In December 2016, I started texting this guy in my classes who I thought was kinda cute, but we never talked in person.
 

He sent me some really weird and inappropriate images; furry porn, disgusting poop humor, graphic dick jokes. I made it clear that I didn't find it funny. I tried to initiate conversation about serious topics and he was receptive as a brick wall. I quickly lost interest and stopped talking to him. Without context, he sent me a 'joke' about a woman being 'penetrated' (assaulted) with a knife, and some creepy videos (they looked like the weird ones aimed at kids these days). After the break, I avoided him. He'd follow me out of class sometimes though, and sit near where I was studying and just stare at me for hours without saying anything (he talks to others).


Now he's doing his Ph.D at the same school (in the same small major, we see each other in passing, he's in one of my classes. Still never talks, only stares). He sent me a random message saying that he feels like I ""either hate"" him, or ""have a crush"" on him, and thinks I'm ""smart and sexy.""


I'm actively avoiding him and he must be delusional if he thinks I'm even remotely interested in him at this point. I hadn't spoken to him in person or online in three years, for crying out loud, despite having instant access over text. I write that I don't hate him and I don't have a crush on him because I don't know him at all, and I say ""I'm not interested in dating anyone right now."" His response: ""Well, I hope I get to know you,"" which I ignored.


Recently, there was a department game night that I helped set up. He was there. When I was shutting things down, he asked randomly if he could try on my coat. I made a face and said ""...sure?"" and he grabbed it. 


Who even asks to try on someone's coat that you NEVER talk to or otherwise interact with, who is obviously uncomfortable with you asking? He ran his hands through it and made a weird smirking face. That was the only interaction the entire night. 

Few hours later, he sends me this: ""I'm enamored by your mastery of party games c:"". I'm angry, cranky, tired, and so annoyed with him that I just respond, ""Dude leave me alone. Seriously not interested,"" and block him. 

**TL;DR**: I was texting this guy from undergrad, but he turned out to be really weird, immature, and inappropriate, and he never talked to me in person though he would follow me and stare. He sent me really creepy jokes + videos without context. Now in grad school at the same institution, he's been trying to flirt even though I've been avoiding him for years over text and in person (and he STILL doesn't talk to me in person, just stares). I told him once politely that I wasn't interested in dating anyone, and he just recently tried flirting again, so I snapped and rejected him by saying ""Dude leave me alone. Seriously not interested"" and blocking him.

MF in the past has really upset me and my family and has started all kinds of shit between my brother and his gf, my sister, and me personally. Now I am generally a forgiving person, however I am no push over.

My problem here is this: MF wants a ride but has done nothing good for me and only wronged me, but this person is good friends with my other friend (whose house I will be going to) and I feel that denying a ride will make me an asshole. I feel very conflicted.   "
188,c3luq5,"WIBTA if I threatened to throw out my roommate’s stuff? Okay so I (22F) have been living with my bf (23M) and his friend (23M) for the last year.

Roommate has been an absolute nightmare to live with. He’s really passive aggressive and never helps clean but always gets mad if the common area isn’t spotless (when he literally vomited in his room and didn’t ever clean it up).

In the last few weeks he’s gone from passive aggressive to just straight up aggressive and has been really mean to my bf and I about a variety of thing (including things he’s really self conscious about which super isn’t cool).

Our lease is over at the end of this month (thank god) but he moved out about a week ago without any notice. However, he’s left a TON of his stuff including small things like groceries to big things like one of his guitars, a bunch of shoes, and random stuff like a pile of razors. I assumed he would have gotten the rest of his stuff by now, but he literally hasn’t come back since he left.

My bf and I are moving out tomorrow with the exception some furniture we’re trying to sell but if we can’t sell it we’re gonna take it to goodwill on Wednesday (the 26th). We want to use the rest of the time in the lease to deep clean the apartment, getting all the places that get missed because of furniture or just get kind of forgotten about (like the top of the kitchen cabinets). And a lot of that cleaning will be trying to clean up his vomit stain, of the mold that’s been growing in his bathroom, or the grease he’s gotten all over the kitchen.

We know the roommate isn’t gonna help with anything given his track record, and it’s gonna be hard to clean with his stuff there. Additionally, we’ll get charged by the landlords if we leave belongings in the unit.

I know our lease isn’t technically over until the 30th, but it would be really hard to deep clean in a half day so  ideally every thing is gone by the 26th.

WIBTA for telling my ex roommate that we’re gonna throw his shit out by Wednesday if he doesn’t pick it up? Knowing him if I don’t he’ll wait till the last second or never pick it up at all and get mad it wasn’t hand delivered to him for his convenience."
189,bf3eyq,"WIBTA if I change the rules for friends spending the night? Hello, this is my first Reddit post and I'd like some advice please. 

I have 3 great children.  17 Male, 16 Male, and 14 Daughter.  I don't claim to be the prefect parent and neither does my wife, but we definitely think we are raising them to be good kids.  

I am not stupid either.  I know kids have sex, but we have always had what I thought was a fair policy.  Both sons are allowed to have friends spend the night if they're boys, and my daughter can have her female friends spend the night.  We allow opposite sex children to be over but they can't be in the bedroom with the doors closed.  

Well my middle son (Noah) has found a loophole.  Turns out he's gay.  We have suspected for awhile, but my wife recently confirmed it.  Now I am totally okay with him being gay, that's not the issue.  He has a ""friend"" (Tyler) who is a pretty nice kid.  Well he spent the night last weekend and we did what we always do and put the blowup mattress in my sons room.  

Breakfast came the next morning and my wife went to go get the boys to eat.  She went upstairs to get them and knocked on the door, no answer.  So she opened it slowly and low and behold they're both sleeping in Noah's bed spooning each other.  The sheets on the blowup never touched.  So she closed the door and went up 30 minutes later and knocked louder.  This time after hearing some running around Noah opens the door with Tyler in the blowup.  

So we have both decided we want Noah to tell us when he's ready and not to call him out.  We have made it clear we'd be okay with anything.  In the meantime though, that creates a problem.  Noah is having his boyfriend (or I assume) spend the night and hooking up with him.  

So in order to be fair against all 3 kids, Tyler shouldn't be spending the night.  So my oldest son has two twin beds in his room, and my daughter has pullout second mattress in her room.  So my wife's idea is that we ""break"" the blowup mattress.  We can set them both up the family room which is downstairs, a couch for each of them.   So this wouldn't change the rules for the other two as they already have extra room in their rooms, but Noah wouldn't have the room in his full (although he proved us wrong on that), and he would have to sleep downstairs with no more blowup.  

I admit I go so back and forth on this one.  On one hand, it's not fair to the other two kids, but on the other hand he did find a loophole.  

My other concern is I don't know how Tyler's parents feel about homosexuality.  I am afraid their could be backlash if they find out he's been sleeping in the bed with my son.  

So AITA here?"
190,eii2f5,"AITA for not giving back my deceased step mom's belongings? This is going to be a long one, so bare with me. 

My step mom died 10 years ago, almost 11. My dad adopted her two kids who were 17 and 19 at the time so that she knew that her kids were taken care of. She did not adopt me, or my brother. In her will, she said that everything she owned should be split evenly between the kids, which there is 5 of us. 

Years go by and we finally all get together and divide up her belongings. My dad had us pick straws to see what the order was going to be for who gets to choose an item at a time. I was second and my sister was first. My sister chose a table, I chose a piece of furniture that is very unique and I really liked. I thought that since she didn't pick it first, that it wasn't as important to her as the table. Oh how fucking wrong I was. 

It is an odd piece of furniture and was their grandmothers and only after the fact of me picking that piece of furniture, did her kids say that there shouldn't have been pieces that should have been distributed between us. 

Fast forward to four years later and now my sister is saying that I need to give back all of ""her mom's"" belongings. She is upset that I got the unique piece of furniture and also got the kitchen table that ""her mom designed"", but in reality, my dad paid for the table and I got the table because my husband and I helped my dad move house. (side note, I live 7 hours away from my dad and his wife. My sister lives 1). I also have two kids and work a full time job, plus some. 

My dad wasn't going to keep the table and just leave it in the house, which would have been a total waste. I didn't have a kitchen table in my house, I had one of those folding banquet white table. He offered it to me, and I said yes. Now, keep in mind, my dad is the executor of the will, so I don't think that I need to ask anyone, minus the executor of the will for stuff that wasn't chosen during the distribution of items. Plus, my dad paid for the table in the first place AND he offered it to me.  

My sister got her blood brother, my adopted brother involved and is now demanding that I give back everything that was her mom's. I personally don't think that I have to give her back anything considering we all went through the belongings and chose a piece one turn at a time. My adopted brother and I got into a heated conversation while I am on holiday in another country and at the end I told my adopted brother to talk to dad. I also said that at the end of all of this mess, I want nothing to do with either one of them. It is very clear that they don't see me as family. 

So, Reddit, AITA?"
191,buw82b,"AITA for not enjoying my bachelorette party?   

Some background on me: I’m not a big partier. I hate loud bars, clubbing, big parties in general. I’m more reserved and would much rather have a nice meal or hang at someone’s house with my close-knit friends. I’ve known my friends (now bridesmaids) for years and I’ve always been the wet blanket friend, but they all seemed fine with it.

As one does when they are engaged, my bridesmaids threw me a bachelorette party. I’m super grateful that they planned this event for me, and they’ve made me feel so special for the duration of my engagement. But to be honest, I thought they knew me better.

Months before this bachelorette party, I mentioned that I’d rather not do the traditional bar hopping/strip club/getting plastered type of weekend, and that I’d much rather go to the beach, drive into the nearest city for sightseeing or shopping, go to a spa or even just a BBQ at someone’s house. However, the actual bachelorette night was exactly the opposite: pregaming, bars, more bars, and to top off the night: a karaoke bar. I know I sound like a huge buzzkill and this is the default for bachelor/bachelorette parties and most people are probably reading this thinking “that sounds like a blast!” I’m happy for you, but that’s not me.

I spent the whole night trying to get through it. I was miserable, and my friends noticed how much I hated it. The next morning, they asked me if I had fun. I tried to lie and say that I did, but they could tell. I admitted that it wasn’t fun for me and I thought that they knew me well enough to know that’s not my style. A big fight ensued where they accused me of being a bridezilla and that they “spent so much money on this night” and I accused them of using my bachelorette party as an excuse to get wild and slutty and that they didn’t care about what I wanted.

She was super excited and I was happy I got to spend time with her, since she lives alone now. She then decides to invite 2 of her friends and expects me to pay for it.

193,dncyrc,"WIBTA if I had a serious talk with my flatmate? Basically we had a new girl come live here last month and except for a few nights she constantly has her friends over for dinner. When I say dinner, I mean it takes her an hour to cook, they eat for a bit and then stay till midnight in the kitchen chatting. This has bothered both me and the other girl, simply because we don't wanna cook in front of her friends. They barely greet you and then they speak another language (the other girl also got the vibe they were chatting about her because they kept looking at her and speaking again after) so its just not ideal to cook in front of a group when you are mixed between invading their meal and them constantly watching you vibes.

&#x200B;

The second issue is the girl bringing guys over at night. It's more ironic because when the other flatmate asked her was she going to a party tonight (Friday), she acted almost shocked (which is weird, because she does go out alot at night) and was giggling and saying ""no, why would you ask that?"". This is the girl who asked me the other day before I even got to greet her when I left my room, she shot me with a mother-like ""where are you going?"". So, I could care less whether she goes out or not, I do, however have a problem with her bringing a guy over. Firstly, we don't lock our bedroom doors and secondly its an all-girl flat.

&#x200B;

The things I want to say to her are

&#x200B;

IMO its common courtesy (the other flatmate agrees with me because we do it with each other) to let the other person know that someone is coming over for a meal or staying over. She hasn't had the friends over as much but she was having them over nearly 4 nights a week at one point. She also uses my pan (which I am fine with but..) and she doesn't clean it until they are leaving, so if i go out I'd have to interrupt them to tell her to clean the pan, but i wouldn't even get that far because the counter does be covered.

&#x200B;

If she doesn't want to say in advance for whatever reason, the issue is still them staying there till midnight because when are we supposed to cook and have our meals? She never brings them into her room after which she could, she has alot of space in there.

&#x200B;

Bringing a guy over who we don't know and I don't even know if she knows them that well (from things she mentioned before shes a bit careless with guys, thats not me judging her hanging out with guys, its just serious red flags came up about one guy after she told me things he said and he had been in our flat multiple times) for me is not cool. Especially because its all girls in our flat, we don't always wear bras or clothes that I would be comfortable with in front of a guy. Also the safety side, we don't know who he is, maybe I'm freaking out because I read Ted Bundy's wiki but still I don't think its cool.

194,bc3sm2,"AITA for asking my roommates gf to pay rent? So my roommmate asked me if his girlfriend can live with us for two months.


I said its fine but she needs to pay her fair share of rent even if she lives in his room and any food we share is also split 3 ways.


Since we moved in we split rent by a simple formula:

Total rent divided by amount of space * the space we get in our personal rooms + half of the shared living space

Example:
The apartment is 1000sq ft and costs $1000

My room is 300sqft and his is 200sqft the rest is of course 500sqft
So i pay 300+ (500/2) = 550 
And so on

I said it would only be fair for his gf to pay one third of the shared space. In the example above that would be $166.

Utilities are included in this calculation.

He says she should not pay any part of the rent „because she lives in his room“

195,d1x3lv,"WIBTA if I send a complaint to the regional board of pharmacists? In my country pharmacist are regulated by a what I could translate as a board, or a league, of pharmacists. The board collects complaints and could take action against pharmacists. In a worst case scenario it could even revoke their license, but I don’t know exactly how they match faulty behaviour and punishments, and I am afraid my complaint could hurt the business of this specific pharmacy too much.

The story: I got my prescription and went to the pharmacy close to my doctor’s office. It was sort of busy, but customers were waiting in line patiently. When my turn came I approached the desk and handed in my papers. While the pharmacist were collecting my items a man, probably a friend, cut the queue and started chatting with the doctor. She kept working, and she laid my prescriptions right in front of him. My name, medication and the equivalent of the social security number were spread in front of a stranger. After few second, hoping they realised how inappropriate this is, I forced myself between the man and the  counter and I picked up my papers. I gave them back to the annoyed pharmacist when she gave me my medicines, but I also told her she acted unprofessionally: she should not chat with friends while serving a customer, and more importantly she should handle medical papers with more care, as required by law.
She and the man grunted in a Karen-ish style, informing me that the man is not interested in my prescription. They mocked me a little saying I’m too rigid and too upset over nothing. I replied stating that I don’t want my personal information paraded around unknown persons, and they mocked me more. 
So I channeled my own inner Karen and informed the pharmacist that I was going to leave a bad review of her business. She started apologising, but ruined everything when she once again told me I was making a fuss over nothing. She also followed me outside the building, telling me she is a very professional doctor with a vey professional history and so forth. I refused to listen and left.

Privacy law in a medical environment are a big deal here. Usually the line starts a few steps back from the counter and only the customer that is being served is asked to approach the pharmacist. Although I reckon that the man wasn’t interested in my papers I have been uncomfortable with a third person inserting himself between me and the pharmacist, and I have been more uncomfortable with the pharmacist condoning such attitude . But her change of behaviour when I told her I was going to report the episode makes me think she knows she broke the law and she’s afraid of the reaction of the board.

I could let it go, There are other pharmacists within walking distance and I don’t have to deal with this woman anymore, but on the other side I want to file a report because of her mocking me for being a “too good citizen”.

I am the youngest of 5 girls and when my father died I had to take in A. My bf and I lived with my father at the time of his passing and we quickly had to find a place. During the 3 weeks of looking and moving A stayed with B. But after 2 weeks B called me crying asking me to hurry up because A didnt appreciate all that B was doing. She even yelled at me for setting up my bed first even though A had a place to sleep at B's.

It's two years later and now fiancee and I are making it work. But we are both getting emotionally stressed. I work and go to school full time. I'm working on my career so my fiancee cares for A most of the time except hygiene (showers and what not) where I will take care of it. 

I would like  date nights for me and the fiancee. He would like some time to pick up some shifts. 


My sister B will watch A once a week for 5-7 hours but the issue is she'll typically text a day or two heads up saying she can do it. 

There is an entire text conversation but I'm cutting it down for  word limit (will provide verbatim if asked): 

 I asked if B would mind if on friday we set up a day for the following week so fiancee and I can make plan something. She tells me how A is my responsibility and it's not her (B) fault I'm here. I say how I just want a heads up and that's it. She says how we wouldnt be where we are without A and her money and we should be greatful. Then she asks to see A finances (she gets SSI) and I say no because theres no need if A is taken care of. A has health and eye insurance. Goes to the dentist every 3 months. Clothed. Clean. And happy.B tells me I'm the guardian and act like it. Then insults A, fiancee and I. Saying things like A stinks all the time and to make sure she doesnt anymore (I bathe her everyday and never smelt anything bad so I wasnt aware of this). How all of fiancee's items are from A (everything he has was brought from when he lived with his mother. He doesnt like spending money since he doesnt make much) and how I am being ungrateful and I'm an American so I should be happy. B says how it's amazing shes even offering to help when she knows nothing about fiance and I.  I tell her maybe it's not a good idea to pick up A at all for awhile and she tells me how shes going to come knocking on my door til I let her in. She doesnt care if I call the cops shell wait. I didnt want A to get caught up so I said fine. But I'm really uncomfortable with B around A now.

But here's mine. Basically, I have this old religious friend that I don't talk to anymore because I'm no longer religious like him. Yesterday was my birthday, and he greeted me happy birthdays with gif emojis and all that shiz. Then several minutes later, things escalated and he suddenly went all bananas explaining to me that science is lying to us and the earth was really flat, raining down bible verses and churning down greek and latin translations of the interpretation. At first I thought he was being sarcastic. But he even went on to prove to me that the Earth is flat, covered by a glass dome, and the shape of rainbows proved that. Yanking down verses to prove his point.

Before that, I was being really friendly up until I realised he was pretty fucking serious. This guy has been my friend real constantly for over a year. And I am concerned. I went to debunk his crap and told him midpoint that flat earth is bullshit.

Be wary, I'm no longer with them and it's been 2-3 years. I am zero percent religious. Yet this guy is trying to talk to me about things I don't want to talk about, which I have told him already like 2 years ago. I told him I don't want to hear any of the religious wachamahoochie

Take note, I did not initiate any of this conversation, he was the one who forced my hand into this kind of shit. I believe in respecting other people's belief. But AITA for telling him otherwise?"
198,celbxy,"AITA for wanting my cat to live inside? My family bought a female cat in 2010, who is now ten-years-old and named Lettuce (Lettie for short). I had never had a pet before that, and my mom really wanted me to have a dog because she doesn't like cats. However, my dad is allergic to dogs and we were living in an apartment at the time, so they eventually got a cat. She was considered feral when we got her, and the lady at the shelter said she would never be a friendly lap-cat. Within a year of me being a determined little shit, she was incredibly affectionate. I'm the only person she allows to pick her up and sling her around at will, and she trusts me most, but she's really friendly. She's currently an outdoor cat in that she lives on our back porch and we feed her and take her to the vet.

When we got her, my parents made it very clear that Lettie was MY cat. They didn't like her, they didn't really want her, I was supposed to be responsible for her. However, I was nine/ten, and not very responsible, so I admittedly wasn't great at emptying her litter box every day, making vet appointments, etc. So they took a large share of the responsibility. When I got older though, and we moved to an actual house, I was better. They continued insisting that she was my cat up until the day my mom decided to kick her outside in 2014 without even discussing it with me. She just stopped letting her back inside when she went out.

She argues that Lettie's healthier out there and that we were repressing her natural instincts. She also pointed out that she was constantly whining to get out, and that she's keeping down on vermin. In truth, it seems more like she didn't like how ""talkative"" Lettie can be. She had also tried several times to convince me to give her up to the shelter, which I adamantly refused. She argues that she spent more time taking care of the cat when I was younger (which is true, but I was nine/ten) and that because she's the adult she can make the call. My dad agrees with me, but he's too wishy-washy to argue about it.

I argue that she's a domesticated cat who had never spent a lot of time outside before we kicked her out, she may have been chubby, but never enough to raise comment from the vet, and all cats whine to get outside. Moreover, she's getting old and less able to defend herself. I also think it's awfully coincidental that after whining for years that having a pet made life harder, not long after kicking Lettie outside my mom bought herself an energetic, destructive puppy. She'd always wanted one, and it feels like she prioritized her want for a dog over my long-term emotional connection to the cat she'd never really wanted. 

I don't know though. She's spent four years outside now, and she's a good hunter, but she's turning gray and I never get to see her because I'm at college. I really miss my cat, who was my only friend for a long time, and I worry about her all the time. My mom might have a point though. 

Am I the asshole for pushing this issue with my mom?"
199,cmi7d2,"AITA for not hearing out the girl who stole from my friend's grave? Backstory: A good friend of mine (we'll call her Cate) and her parents both passed away in a horrible highway accident a year ago this week. Everyone in the car died, although her father was in a coma for 2 weeks before he passed. My friend's little sister (we'll call her Jennifer) is the only family member alive, as she was out of the state at the time. It was devastating. 

When Cate and I were in middle/early high school, we were friends with this girl named Erica. We were all pretty close, but eventually we had a falling out when Erica got pregnant and was really just mean to the both of us, and even went so far as to tell Cate to cut herself. Erica was just a totally fucked up individual. 

After Cate died, Erica started posting old pictures and making lengthy posts about how hard it was and how much she missed Cate. It made me pretty mad since they hadn't been friends since middle school, but I kept my mouth shut as I felt I didn't have a right to judge, especially because Cate and I had drifted in the normal way graduates do as adults. We still kept in contact, but we weren't as close as we used to be.

Recently, Jennifer came out and asked an anonymous person to stop stealing from Cate's grave and to stop messaging her horrible things. Apparently things didn't stop, because last night Jennifer posted and finally admitted it was Erica stealing personal items of Cate's from her grave site, and that when she had to get the police involved to get it back (it was a name tag from where Cate worked), it was hanging from a lanyard in her car's rearview mirror. Jennifer also said Erica had messaged her after and called her a ""bitch, just like [her] mother"". I was floored, and unfriended and blocked Erica.

Today, an old mutual friend messaged me and told me Erica wanted to talk to me and explain. She said that Erica was being ""put on blast"" and that this is being ""misconstrued"" and it's all a big mistake. I told her to go fuck herself and there is no way you can misconstrue stealing from someone's grave. The mutual friend said I was heartless and that Erica is just greiving and that she has changed since high school, and that I should give her a chance to explain. 

I feel a little guilty for being so mean. AITA for not hearing Erica out?"
200,erwwyx,"WIBTA for asking to be called the team leader at work? I’ll try to keep this short. I was put on a big project a few months back and was told that I’d be getting a coworker to help me part time. I’m a young female, and the coworker is a middle aged man.  

When we all met for the first time at the start of the project, my boss began by saying that the part-time coworker will officially be the “Team Leader”, despite the fact that I have more experience and am the only one working full time on this project.  

I chalked it up to sexism and decided to let it go for the time being, but the further we get into this project the more apparent it is becoming that the “Leader” is utterly incapable (disorganized, overly-emotional, and distractable). He consistently does things wrong which I then have to go back and re-do. On top of that, he frequently mentions how stressful it is for him to have to be the leader. 

So, WIBTA if I approached our boss and asked to be officially put in charge of the project?

EDIT: I should add that he has also been asking others for advice on how to lead the project while expressing how important it is for him to prove he can be in charge."
201,bajyy9,"AITA for not letting my younger sibling use a VR headset that I borrowed from a friend? So today I borrowed a VR headset (HTC Vive) from a friend to play some games in my free time as she doesnt use it a lot.


I brought the headset home, set it up all was good, I played for the majority of the day, then enter my brother, who is always in the right obviously and gets everything he wants on a silver plate.
He sees how cool the VR is, and asks me to try, I tell him no because it's not my headset and I don't think that my friend would like me lending the headset to a 10 year old. He runs off crying to my mom, who then tells me to let him play. I stay firm on my answer and say no, and then my mom gets angry at me for not letting him play. So I guess I am wondering, am I the asshole here? Just to point out those headsets cost upwards of like $500."
202,asad7x,"AITA for not letting my cousin's 2 small children come around and play with my dogs? Long time lurker, first-time poster here. Also, English isn't my first language, so bear with me.

I'm a university student, I am currently making my second and third degree at the same time, so next to work I have little to no free time. I'm living next to my parents, in my own house, and they are professional dog breeders, so we are having puppies a few times a year.

I have a cousin, he is 6 years older than me (I'm 23) and we never really got along. Since we were small, he always insulted me at family gatherings, that he has better clothes, grades. In my early teens I decided to become an actor (musical), so each and every time he told me, that I am an idiot, but he's generous and will give me some change, when I will be begging on the street later on in my life. I'm now working as an actor btw. He learned to be a pilot but stopped before the final exam and became an engineer. This resulted in a huge fall out with that side of the family. He has never contacted me during those years, but he got married and got 2 children as well. Now we are currently having a litter and he contacted me (not even my parents) if they could come around. My grandma would really like us to have a good relationship but he has been always an asshole to me. Even my father said that I should host a party then, but I am really not interested in him. Would I be the asshole if I just told him no and blocked him?

203,9l5npk,"AITA for punching a guy who was fighting with my grandma? Hi Reddit,
Long Story short: I once was on a vacation with my grandma. She's very lovely and grew me up for many years of my life when my mom had to go to another country to work. She is above 85 years old now, but she still drives pretty good. We were on vacation in Italy (where she also lives) and were returning home after we went shopping.

Once we were on this small highway that connected the many villages in our region, after a tight curve, a car stands almost still. My grandma was going at 50km/h, so luckily she wasn't harmed and didn't receive any trauma or anything,but the crash was unavoidable. Both of our cars went on the emergency lane, so the cars could still pass. We noticed as we got out of the car that after this dude's car there was no traffic, just him going extremely slow for such a kind of street.

He got out too and went super mad at us (he was in his middle age, probably 50-60 and bald) and as soon as my grandma got out of the car, he straight told her many offenses (like ""what the fuck are you doing you old shithead"", ""you shouldn't be allowed to drive!"") I stood in the car as I wasn't the driver, but i noticed that after some minutes of watching my poor grandma being yelled at from this douche, he kicked our car's front and pushed my grandma,almost making her fall over because she told him how he was stupid to go so slow on the road.

I couldn't resist myself but punch that dude in the face. He fell on the floor and remained there, he luckily didn't go KO though. Short afterwards, i took a picture of his license plate with my phone, incase we would ever need that in the future, and drove away.

We also went to a mechanic the next day and had to pay 200€ for our car's front, lights and plate to be repaired. Was I an asshole for punching him? Should've i not done that and tried to let him pay for our car's reparation?

EDIT 1: Feel free to ask me questions regarding what happened if you need more material to judge me."

She then ghosts me do i keep asking for an answer to why she keeps leaving me on read and ghosting me.  When she responds, she never tells me to leave her alone.  I have told her that i would perfer that she just be honest than just lie to me.  I left her alone for about a month and she still was leaving me on read.  I asked if she had something on her mind or if she is going through something and she says no.  I get annoyed and tell her that she needs to be honest and that it doesnt make sense that she claims to always be busy but has a snap score in the 5 thousands.  I wasnt looking for a relationship anymore because i had already lost feelings for her because of the way she was treating me so i was just trying to at least save our friendship.

 denies everything but i keep pushing her so i can get an answer.  I leave her alone for days between messages but still no response.  I tell her im done trying to be friends and now her bff is telling me that she is sad and wants to be friends again.

206,apctv4,"AITA for yelling at boyfriend? So I live in the PNW and we’ve recently been hit with a lot of snow and icy roads. I was hanging out with my bf and was really hesitant about being on the roads for any longer than we had to be. He insisted he’s a great driver in these conditions but that didn’t help my worrying go away. While we were driving he intentionally was speeding and I told him to stop because it was really scaring me. 
He stopped for a while but then he started to INTENTIONALLY skid around on the ice. The first time I asked if he’d PLEASE stop because I was on the verge of an actual panic attack and I was seriously freaking out. So he stopped and apologized. 

Later that night we had to go get some food and he forced me to come with him even though I really didn’t want to be in the car with him after what had happened earlier. He decided it’d be a good idea to drive dangerously on purpose again and I freaked and screamed at him to stop the car. It looked like he was really hurt and I know he’s really sad I screamed at him. He told me that wasn’t necessary, but personally I think it was. I feel bad that I had to yell at him but he was making me feel upset. He’s currently ignoring me until I apologize for yelling.

207,cnftn5,"AITA for not wanting to help out with putting my godbrother to bed? Hey all. So based on the title, I’m not totally sure if I’m in the wrong here. Essentially for the last little while my godbrother has been staying with us. He’s actually the son of my godsister lol, making him kind of my nephew, but godbrother is easier. He’s six, and I’m sixteen(Female, this will be important in a second) so there’s a big gap between us. I love him to bits and pieces, he’s such a sweet and funny kid, but whew am I tired of putting him to sleep. My brother and I alternate, this week I’ve done it twice and him once, but it’s a struggle. The problem isn’t so much should I keep doing it, since he’s leaving in a couple of days, but am I a jerk for wanting to complain about it?

Basically, my jobs are to do the following:
-Bathe him (which is a little weird for me)
-Put lotion on him
-Get him to brush his teeth
-PJ’s
-Some time on the IPad
-Then put him to bed

The bathing part is what I have the most issue with, since he’s *six* and I’m still washing him and stuff. My mom says since he’s not at his home he might feel uncomfortable and I should help with it, but goddamn does it feel super fucking weird for me. He’s six! I’m sixteen! Giving him a bath! 

The lotion and stuff is easy, but putting him to bed is hard as hell. He doesn’t want me to leave, but obviously I have stuff to do and need him to go to bed. Tonight was the worst- he started just scream-crying, and I was just yelling back. My mom has to come upstairs and move him, putting him to sleep in a different room. All I want is to be able to go downstairs and play video games or finish up some programming or something, and I can’t because I don’t get downstairs to my bed until eleven, and I have to go straight to sleep because I usually have to babysit (more kids, yay!) or go out all day. 

What bugs me a little is how my mom generally doesn’t help. She works *all* day so I get it, she’s tired, but we’re the only ones to put him down. But at the same time I don’t want to ask her to do it, because she’s working all day and so hard for all of us. AITA for feeling a little resentful, and like I don’t want to do it?"
208,d8ofun,"AITA for not allowing my future child into my MIL house? My wife is pregnant and due in a few months.  Her mother lives very close to us, about 5 streets away, and we rarely go over there now.  The reason being her mom and her husband smoke inside their house.  I've been over there a few times to help with computer issues and we typically have Thanksgiving there.  Even if they don't actively smoke while we are there we still walk out of that house reeking of smoke. 

We have brought the smoke smell up with my MIL and how this will be a problem for us when the baby comes.  She basically says the child may smell like smoke leaving their house but they would never smoke around the child.  That still is unacceptable to me because I have read that smoke residue is the carpet and furniture could potentially be harmful to small children especially.  Not only that but I simply don't think my infant child should smell like smoke.  

My wife is kind of on the same page as me but feels bad telling her mom that she can't have her granddaughter over.  I could maybe be okay with just going over there with the child during Thanksgiving because they do air the house out a bit but I would honestly still be pretty unhappy if the carseat, diaper bag, and other things that can't be easily washed smell like smoke after leaving.  

My MIL is more than welcome to come by our house anytime to see her granddaughter and do any babysitting at our house (the child will still smell like smoke because my MIL and her husband's clothes always smell like smoke)."

Few years later I actually get around to making it (changed it quite a bit from the original concept I'm not a copyright infringement asshole at the very least)  and after 6 months of hard work all by myself I release it and it sells pretty decently, nothing amazing but enough to pay for a good holiday and I'm bringing in some good money on the side each month from continuing sales.

210,a4linw,"AITA for offering one of my roommates beers? I'd like to say I don't think it's generally ok to offer other peoples food or speak for someone else but I feel like the context of this scenario makes it justifiable. The roommate has in the past offered my drinks such as milk/soda to people and said that I wasn't being a ""team player"" for complaining about this despite the fact I'm the only one who buys these things so it's always mine that get used. In addition to the roommate I live with two other men who weren't present for this story.

As further context to this the roommate in question constantly asks me for beer and has for that past few months since moving in always with the promise of ""replacing them once he gets the money"". I've probably gave him 20 or more beers in the time we've live together but I like to try to be fairly easy to live with so although it has bothered me he hasn't even attempted to pay me back like he said I haven't made a big deal out of it.

Fast forward to the other day and we had a few of his friends around for an evening of playing a video game that just came out. While trying to be a good host I offer our guests the drinks I know I have in the kitchen and at the end I remember the roommate has a few beers too so I offer them as an option, saying he probably wouldn't mind because he owes me a few anyway and in general it's been ok for others drinks to be offered to guests.

As I leave to go get the drinks including a beer I turn back to double check with the roommate anyway but mid sentence he starts telling me off and shouting at me  for being ""rude and presumptuous"" offering one of his beers and that ""Just because you gave me beer doesn't mean you now get to take my beer without asking"". I tried to explain that I was about to ask him but he continued to repeat himself without acknowledging what I said. To make matters worse the person who wanted the beer changed their mind after this and the rest of the evening was fairly awkward despite me trying to play it off.

So Reddit I'd like to know what you think about this scenario, I realize that offering someone else's food is generally asshole behavior but I feel like it was acceptable given this context and the roommate was being fairly unreasonable in how he reacted to this, I'm considering moving out due to this consistent pattern of it being a one way pattern of me putting more time and money into the ""team effort"" of the house."

212,9ao5ss,"AITA for feeling resentful that my GF is sometimes feel to 'anxious' to do household chores? Sorry, bit of a wall of text.

My GF and I are meant to take turns cooking and cleaning. If one cooks, the other does the dishes. The sharing of this work is important to me as we both work and have little free time at the end of the day.

Sometimes on the days I cook my GF says she feels sick or anxious and goes to bed after eating, leaving me with the dishes. I (think) I've cottoned on to the fact that the illness or anxiety seems to happen right after dinner, when she's supposed to clean up.

Tonight the same thing happened and I felt resentful. She went to bed with that I honestly feel was self induced panic attack-like symptoms, and I cleaned up. During washing up I opened up some tupperwear that had apparently been in her bag for ages and was hit by a putrid smell (rotting cheese). I had to run to the kitchen window and vomitted out into the garden. 

Hearing me gagging she poked her head out of the bedroom and asked what was wrong. I said ""What the hell was in that! It smells fucking awful"". She didn't say anything and went back into the bedroom. I sprayed airfreshner over the dishes and continued cleaning. After I had finished she came out of the bedroom and could tell I was a little miffed. She asked what was wrong and I said it didn't matter and went back to what I was doing.

She pressed the issue so I said ""Well, I knew you were going to get sick when I started cooking tonight. It upset me a little, but I'm ok now, can we just drop it?"". She got really upset: ""What? You're a clairvoyant now? If I treated you the same way you treated me around this sort of health stuff you wouldn't be happy!""

I kept insisting ""Look, lets just drop it. I don't know why you asked me if you get upset when I answer honestly"". She replied ""No. We can't drop this. You can't say these sorts of things."" She then proceeded to move towards the front door and I asked where she was going. She replied ""I'm going out. I don't feel safe here"".

I was pretty taken aback, so I said ""What? Around me? That's really a really hurtful thing to say"" (At this point I hasten to add that I never have been aggressive or violent against anyone, ever), She said: ""Yeah, it's always about you isn't it!"".

I this point I was getting pretty upset so I said ""OK, if you feel that way you stay here and I'll go. I'll go out for a drive for a while"". Her reply was ""No. You just don't get it do you?"" Me: ""I don't know what to do - you don't want to be around me, so I'm leaving. I thought this was what you wanted."" Her reply again ""Yeah, that's it - you just don't get it.""

I went to leave, but as I was getting my things she sort of signed and said ""Look. Let's just drop it. I'm sorry.""

We hugged and I too, said that I was sorry. But I don't feel I should be. I feel I was in my right to feel resentful, to voice my feeling clearly and calmly when asked, to say I wanted to drop the topic several times and to offer to leave when things got too much.

Now, I just want to add a note about this anxiety thing. She has anxiety issues. And I know how they feel because I have them too (in fact, I also have PTSD). However, my anxiety has never stopped me from working, coming home, eating dinner, watching Netflix, only to then kick in just as it's my turn to do some cleaning with such consistency. I'm sorry, maybe I am the asshole, but I just don't buy it."

I am welcome at family events (holidays, birthdays, reunions, etc.) however, my boyfriend of two years is not. When I first came out, it was hell with my parents. Then my boyfriend got a promotion that moved him out of state. I told my family I would be moving 7 months before the move to give them time to process and such.

I've struggled with putting this up... My sister won't speak to me anymore and its especially hard because we have a close twin connection. I feel like the asshole but at the same time, i feel like i did what i had to.

Over the last year she started singing with this guy on a karaoke app. She talked about him constantly, but only to me. She chatted with him on the app alot but never talked on the phone or even seen his picture. He lived in France, he spoke French and English and he had a set of pipes. I would like to say my sister fell for him, but it was beyond that. She fell for the situation... she lost alot of weight recently and her husband has been the only person shes been in a relationship with. I believe she fell in love with the idea of a french guy liking her... 

So.. she started to believe he was hacking her karaoke app by changing the recommended songs as ""messages"" to her. Like if the song was called ""i love you"", that was him sending her a message. It happened alot.. then she confronted him about the hacking and he told her he was gay. Things got much worse. He was hacking everything now, any app that had recommended anything was a sign. She started to believe he was gonna kidnap her, put her in a bunker, impregnate her and keep the baby. She put this together based on suggested ads and videos... 

It got even worse. He apparently moved down the street.. She believes the whole time it was actually a couple, with 3 kids pretending to be a french guy. They accidentally hit her dog, so she thinks thats their plan, to kill the dogs one by one so they can get to her easier. 

So, my BIL who has been in our lives almost 20 years only knows they sung together on the app. He didn't know she had feelings for him, he didn't know that she was ready to move to France (i didnt even tell him that part). She really needs help and i thought if i told him he can gradually get her to talk about it... I know him saying he was gay made her snap. She wasn't willing to go see a professional, this was what i thought would help. 

Well, he just got mad and used it against her for months, he didn't care about her mental illness. He ended telling her that I told him she was in love with him while they were fighting, now she thinks I'm a horrible person. AITA?"
216,d6hk2i,"AITA for making a formal complaint of discrimination to a building manager, and threatening a lawsuit, for key-locking the men's room, but not the women's room? My job requires me to travel to many different office buildings in the Tristate area. Because I tend to travel frequently, I use and rely on, the public men's rooms in these office buildings. There is a specific building that I visit probably 3 to 6 times per month. (In this case, I am doing work for the building itself, and not any particular company, in any of the suites, inside the building.) For whatever reason, the public men's rooms in the hallways/common areas of this building are all locked, on every floor. This forces you to go into one of the suites and request a key from the front desk employees of the particular company leasing that space. The women's rooms are NEVER locked, on any floor, in any area. (And yes, this bothered me enough that I have checked every restroom, muliple times.) I complained to the building manager earlier this year about this situation, to which I received the reply that she, ""didn't realize this was happening, and it would be addressed."" I returned later that week, and found the men's rooms still locked, but not the women's rooms. I then spoke with her on a separate occasion about this, to which she said she, ""forgot, but will address it today."" Since then, I have been back to the building 9 times, all of which I found the doors still locked. (About 3 months have passed since the inital conversation.) I tried calling the building manager on 3 separate occasions, with no response. (I suspect she is avoiding me.) Because of this, I met with an attorney last week, and he sent a formal letter to the building manager that if this situation is not remedied, we have no choice but to pursue legal action on the basis of discrimination. AITA?

217,cbyah7,AITA for not going to friends destination wedding? My friend is getting married in Greece next year. My wife and I and baby are invited but after a number of weeks of thinking about going we have had to say sorry we just can't go. Having a baby in childcare is damn expensive and dropping a couple of thousand on a trip to Greece is just not plausible. Not to mention how hot it will be with a baby and we may have another or one on the way by then.  I called my friend to let him know and he did not take it well at all. Claimed that because he was best man at our wedding 5 years ago he had not for one second thought we wouldn't be there at his wedding. He's been cold with me ever since I told him. AITA?
218,bhcu5t,"AITA for not speaking with my MIL? I’m not sure whether to post in the relationship advice sub instead because I don’t know how to change my behavior even if I’m TA. Also, sorry about the long post.

I’ve been married for 7 years and I’m very happy and in love with my husband. We live in a different country than my in-laws. After my wedding, I lived with them for about 6 months while my husband was away for work, and it was clear to me that they didn’t like me. I can give examples of their poor treatment of me if asked. But I moved to another place after 6 months and am very happy until they come to visit. Every single time my MIL has visited us, she has started a fight with me. I haven’t had a fight when it’s just my FIL visiting, my husband and I rarely have disagreements and we are able to resolve those peacefully. According to my MIL, my wrongdoings are not helping her enough with her cooking (I try my best, seriously, but that doesn’t meet her expectations, her hobby is cooking), not calling her regularly (I call most weekends but it’s not something I look forward to, so yes I don’t call her more frequently), not cooking special food for them (I’m not passionate about cooking but I do cook some dishes when they arrive. After that she takes over the kitchen and I’m too afraid to say anything.) She has called my parents multiple times to misbehave with them and tell them that they didn’t bring me up well. My parents believe there is a relationship hierarchy in which husband’s family ranks higher since I married into their family, so they just silently listen to her and try to soothe her. So my solution to maintaining a peaceful relationship is to not have conversations with her unless absolutely necessary.

They arrived last weekend and yesterday evening she suddenly started crying that I don’t speak with her and other topics that I mentioned above. I touched my head to her feet asking her to forgive me for my wrongdoings but she didn’t relent. Now my husband travels a lot for work and he doesn’t know about this long history of abuse. But I was disconcerted at this older woman crying and didn’t know how to handle it, so I FaceTimed him and told him that she was crying. She immediately denied everything when he spoke to her and asked him not to worry. Then she called my parents and told them that they didn’t bring me up well and relayed her litany of complaints against me. My parents are accusing me of being an AH to her. My in-laws will live with me till mid-June while my husband will be mostly away and I don’t know how to maintain peace at home except minimum conversation. This morning I left for work as soon as I could and am planning to return home late and follow this strategy for the remainder of their stay. 

But AITA for this strategy and for my behavior with her? Also, not what this sub is for, but what do I do these 1.5 months?"
219,enpywv,"AITA for ditching Christmas with my husband's family? Christmas was a 4.5 hour round trip to brother in law's house.  They served 'sandwich bar' for the holiday meal to use up the bread and lunch meat. Yes, this is true, it happens every year and it's not because of lack of finances.  My husband and I work until 9ish on Christmas Eve delivering packages for UPS and have to work the day after Christmas also.  We eat sandwiches every workday as that is what is convenient on a delivery truck.  (no heat, no microwaves, not many options).   I was tired from an exhausting delivery season working my job first and then helping him deliver during peak season (just imagine the plethora of Amazon Prime, 11-14 hour days in December).  I went out for sushi and a movie with a friend and had a wonderful time. I have some guilt but don't know if I should.  I offer up our house for the holidays because of our situation with work.  It is always shut down as it isn't a central location for others and I do understand and respect that.  Everyone else is either retired, teachers/principals and have the week off. They just don't put any effort into the holiday meal and aren't considerate of our work situation.  I would like to visit these folks but on a day when I can enjoy the visit and not be tired and grumpy. If anyone has a similar situation, what do you do differently to make it work for you to? Should I suck it up and go next year even though I resent it? AITA?"
220,celb67,"AITA for not telling my mom that I was going to another state for a (potential) job physical/drug testing Backstory to this: Mom doesn't want me to take this job because it would mean that I would be ""working alongside"" her ex-husband, my biological father, and that if I take this job it would crush her. It's a fed job, and I tried reasoning with her that if I wasn't to get hired anywhere else, doing 2 years at that place and transferring out would be beneficial because of job experience.

Yesterday, I left home under the pretense that I was going to be in another city in my state, and that I wouldn't be home until the next day. Later that night, I got a phone call from her asking me if I was really in that city, or if I was in my father's house. Granted, i lied to her, because I felt considering the backstory to this whole deal, I felt that if I lied, I would be protecting her feelings and this idea that I was betraying her. 

However, like with every lie, they are soon found out. My bluff was quickly called out, to which I was told that I can be expecting to be moved/ forced out of the house and that limited to no contact will be had with her provided I take the job. (Other end of the spectrum is the same thing will happen even if I dont get/take the job).

221,8bv25y,"AITA for questioning my marriage/husband? We have two young kids, and one car. We moved to a town with 500+ miles of bike lanes specifically so that he could ride his bike to work. In the 6 mos we have been here, he has ridden his bike twice. On the third day, I had to pick him up because he said his chain ""might"" break. Mind you, it wasn't actually broken, it just looked like one day it could break so instead of riding it home and fixing it himself, he took it to a shop and left it there for weeks (a major race is coming up) and just picked it up last week. So a total of 3 times in 6 months. Meanwhile the car is shitting out. It's not an old car, it's just a shitty brand, and it keeps having ordeals over and over again. It's a 2010 and requires $400-$1000 worth of work literally every 6 months. Well a couple of weeks ago, I had mentioned that it wasn't turning over well when I started it and that I felt it was going to crap out again in the next couple of weeks. He said I had no definitive proof of that (check engine light wasn't on, it isn't leaking) and that I was just imagining it. Well, I wasn't, and so I scheduled an appointment to get it appraised and to look at cars within our price range. During the week that I was looking at cars -not anything new, just a medium grade SUV like the one we have, that costs less to repair - the cat ate a bunch of bungee ties and had to have emergency surgery to the tune of $4000. At the EXACT same time as the vet calling with the bad news, our daughter's teacher called, freaking out that she has a 104 degree fever. So I ended up having to take the kids to urgent care, then the cat to the animal emergency room, and meanwhile he's at work, kind of just waiting for updates but not really asking how everyone is doing or if I need help juggling all of this. In my mind, at some point, he could have offered to meet us somewhere (his job has several cars that he can use during the day, which is also why we hadn't bought another car.) He often sits around in parking lots between appointments so it's not unusual to have a few minutes here and there in the same town where he could help out. Hasn't offered to help with the cat, hasn't offered to help with the kids. Fine, after 2 kids and he's not once gotten up at night to feed or change a diaper, I get it. He's not gonna change, I quit my job to become a mom, so I have no way out. We also moved thousands of miles away from where I'm from, so I'm entirely dependent on this person who I genuinely am wondering if I even want to be around. Most days, I do not. Anyway, so today he takes the car to go do a routine piss test for his job, and he gets back saying ""good news you can go to a dealership and get whatever car you want because this one shit out entirely. It's basically undrivable."" That's how he wakes me up, by the way. So I get up, and the EPC light is on, and the engine light is on, and it's shaking. When your check engine light blinks that means it needs to be fixed pretty fucking immediately or else it may just blow TF up. So rather than finding his own way to work, riding his bike, or making any move to get it to the mechanic, he asks me to take him in. And drop the kids off. And go buy a new car. And figure out how to finance it with his name and just do all the paperwork and he'll ""cruise by"" and sign it. But at no point was he willing to look at finance offers himself, take the car to the mechanic, or even help get the kids dressed. I told him I would call the mechanic, if he got the kids ready for school, and instead of doing that he made himself a sandwich. So, I do all of that. I drop him off at work and go to my meetings, all while worried that the car isn't going to make it. I take my 1 year old daughter to a hot dealership and walk around in the sun with her, and she's a trooper and was fine, and I choose a car and set up financing online, all that shit. I do all of it, and on the way home I realize that the car very much isn't going to make it to pick him up. So I gently coast, get the other kid, call him, and he asks me to call him an Uber.

222,6pzwac,"AITA - For asking my boyfriend to stop watching TV? I was in the middle of cooking dinner and I asked my boyfriend to set the salad stuff out. I was running around the kitchen like crazy but he was paused and completely mesmerized by the TV my dad was watching in the living room. My boyfriend's worst quality is that when a screen is on he MUST watch it, despite if it's halfway through a movie he doesn't know, a shitty sitcom, or even a dumb commercial. There have been multiple dates in the past where we've gone to restaurants with TVs and I have been ignored the entire meal because he's too caught up and can't look away. Even if it's sports (which he doesn't like) or a Spanish sitcom (he doesn't speak Spanish) anything on a screen will distract him. So I'm trying to cook dinner and get stuff done and he's just paused standing there watching a stupid show. I asked him (snappily, I will admit I was very frustrated because of multiple things at that moment) to please stop watching TV and set the stuff up (it was in his hands) and he yelled at me that I was being controlling. Now we're arguing about it again for the millionth time and his excuse is he didn't grow up in a house where the TV was always playing and he had to sneak out of his room to watch it whereas the TV is always on here and I had my own TV since I was little. I can ignore it easily but he can't. He also doesn't want to try to change it. He seriously gets mesmerized and zones out completely and I really, really wish he could stop. "
223,bvr1aq,"AITA for not wanting to invite my boyfriend to a friend’s birthday party?? This girl is a friend of my friend. I’ve literally only met her 3 times total. One of those times was for 5 minutes. She invited me to her dinner &amp; my boyfriend wants to go. I told him no &amp; he’s being moody.

I just don’t think it’s right for him to self-invite himself or for me to come with him when I *barely know her*. It just makes me seem like the girl who can’t be without her boyfriend &amp; it just makes no sense to bring him when he’s never met her.

He claims it’s implied +1 since he’s my boyfriend &amp; my friend’s bf is coming as well as the birthday girl’s. BUT—those 2 guys are best friends. My boyfriend doesn’t know either of the guys. He knows my friend, but has never met the birthday girl in his life.

224,c8ashx,"AITA for potentially firing/kicking out my abusive adult son knowing he might become homeless? He graduated from a prestigious university and is extremely ambitious, but he got into drugs in high school and became a complete heroin addict after college, which got him fired his dream job and ruined his work prospects. After that, we put him through several rehabs and invited him back home to start over. My husband gave him a job in his small business, and at first it was great, but in the last few years he has gotten completely out of control. 

First, he claims to have ""cured"" himself of heroin but has obviously replaced it with painkillers, pills, constant marijuana use, *heavy* drinking, and who knows what else, yet he flies into a blind rage when you suggest he might need help. He also refuses to go to therapy, drug counseling, anger management, or family counseling.

Furthermore, my husband's clients no longer want to work with him if my son is involved because my son has come to work intoxicated a number of times and been verbally abusive to several clients. He categorically refuses to follow our house ""rules."" Our neighbors are terrified of him because he lets his pit bull run around and blasts his music at inappropriate times, but when they complain about it, he showers profanities on them. They have told us they feel unsafe when he's around, even though they adored him in better times. His friends love him but can't be around him.

Finally, he has deep hatred of us. Growing up, he was rebellious and edgy; that's just his personality, but now he blames us for ruining his life and repeatedly tells us we're awful people who didn't nurture him. Maybe we made mistakes, but we were never abusive and our other children are very happy and successful and we all have a great relationship. My son only began complaining about our parenting in the last year or two, and he's in his thirties! He has become emotionally abusive to me, calling me a bitch and failure of a mother on a regular basis, and he has initiated physical confrontations with my husband several times.

We love him but can no longer feel safe living or working with him, yet he has nowhere to go and no one will hire him in his current condition, despite his flawless academic pedigree. He also refuses any and all advice or help. Everyone in our lives is telling us to cut him loose, but if he becomes homeless how will we forgive ourselves?"
225,b2cdox,"AITA for cancelling plans on my friend with bpd last minute because I woke up feeling really sick? My partner and I are friends with another couple. Let's call them A and B. A has bpd, anxiety, and another handful of mental disorders. Due to the nature of bpd, she used to hate me when we didn't know each other that well. 

I started dating my current SO who was also in that circle of friends, and because of that she gave me another chance. I have PTSD and depression and overtime we bonded over some similar a struggles we go through and she apologized for hating my guts. 

Things have been amicable between us for months, and we take turns hosting weekly with our group of 5-7 friends.  This weekend even though I've been feeling really sick, tired, and emotionally fucked up because I'm pregnant, I still hosted the party. (It's too early to tell anyone).

Sunday we were supposed to go for brunch on a double date. It was A's idea. I woke up and confirmed that we still wanted to go. A said that B was still sleeping but we set a time to meet. About 10-15 minutes later I started having really bad morning sickness and overall body aches. (I've been getting every uncomfortable pregnancy symptom imagineable). 

I message A and say ""I actually don't feel good enough to go out and I'm really nauseous and bloated."" I sent that and then rolled around in pain until passing out.

I woke up later and got a huge block of text from A about how rude I am and that last minute cancellations really triggers her bpd and anxiety along with other things. Since I didn't apologize or propose a rescheduled date she said she would no longer try to make plans with me because it causes her too much anger.

I'll give her that, I did forget to say sorry or suggest another time. But I was in so much pain I wasn't over thinking my cancellation like I usually would.

I have yet to respond, I left it on read. I'm tired of walking on eggshells around A, it's quite exhausting for me. AITA?

226,edxh77,"AITA for not reciprocating to family? When my parents were 17 I was conceived. My grandfather was a big shot in their hometown and he basically banished my mother when she was pregnant. Gave her a car and enough money to get as far away as she could. To her credit my mom managed to balance raising me at the age of 18 and getting her accounting degrees and CPA license.

We live in a small town about a thousand miles from where she grew up. I'd never met my mom's parents until I myself was 17. I'm close with my dad's family and him though my parents never married. My dad is a school teacher in a neighboring state but we all visit often. I'm pretty sure my parents still have feelings for each other, since neither of them ever married and barely date and get together when we're together.

Mom's dad died a couple months ago and we went back for the funeral. Mom needed closure and she wanted to show everyone that she had succeed despite the odds. We were met with coldness from the family.

A couple weeks after the funeral mom's mom started calling. It took a while but the real story came out: grandpa, an overbearing bully had forbade his wife and my mother's brother from contacting us. He himself died without making amends or even trying.

Apparently treating my mom like crap was easier than just telling her the truth, that her own father was bullying them into cutting her off. Over the years if mom ever tried she was met with a litany of her 'offenses'. She only has one: me.

Mom is keeping her family on Low Contact. Based on their mistreatment of her over the years, including telling everyone she was dead, I've decided not to form a relationship. My mother's older brother has been particularly nasty about that, giving my mom a hard time, telling her she'd made me into a disrespectful brat. Mom is understanding but she isnt going to make me do anything if I'm not comfortable.

I'm just concerned. Am I an asshole for not forming a relationship despite knowing the reason they never tried was because my grandpa made them fear trying?"

I made my case stating that had I been asked instead of told, I would've been much more receptive and he made his case basically that she's a girl you have to do manual labor for her or you're a jerk.  An additional statement he made was that she cleaned up around the house as well which was true, but to me there's the shared lease responsibility (mowing), then there's just general living with people (cleaning up the house).


The thing that really got me was that I asked probably around 5 people about it and they all said ITA.  I still feel like I'm NTA pretty strongly.


I recognize the whole thing is petty.  Ended up just not mowing on her turn because I'm stubborn AF.  The grass got hilariously tall."
235,a8ofko,"AITA for flicking my friend when he runs into me with his wheelchair? We’re both in school, sometimes he will drive into me with his electric wheelchair as a joke (he has SMA). This is usually with his foot holder thing which is at the same height as my shins. So I then flick him in the arm or something. He then gets mad and says ‘stop flicking me’ that’s when I say ‘stop running into me’ so he runs into me again. Therefore I flick him again.  Am I the asshole? I have said countless times to stop driving into my shins because it hurts really bad. I understand my flicks will hurt him too, but I think he is being a bit hypocritical. "
236,azmehk,"AITA for calling out my roommate’s fiancée on her manipulation and selfishness in-front of a crowd? Long story but this is a couple months worth of build up so I got to vent

So for some context I live in a house with some great people, among them is my roommate. His fiancée however is a complete nightmare, she’s passive aggressive and plays the victim on issues where there shouldn’t even be a victim. 
I’ve been very patient with her because I really enjoy my roommates company regardless.

An example of this behaviour is one day  a few of us were talking in the kitchen (keep in mind it’s around lunchtime) then she comes in from the living room

Fiancée: maybe I should just do yoga in my room since it’s quiet but could you guys keep it down?

Me: yeah for sure, but I agree if you want complete silence the bedroom is always the best option.

F: (while walking away, in a sad ‘whoa is me’ voice) well I guess I just won’t do yoga in the living room ever again

She began to say how I wasn’t letting her do the yoga she needs and that I need to respect her use of the common area (keep in mind the kitchen is widely considered a common area as well) I backed off this time and let it slide.

Well a couple nights ago it all went to shit when my roommate and I were going to the movies. We were getting in the car and low and behold she comes out the door and gets in the car to join us, to my surprise. We drive to the movie theatre and we all get out and start walking together to the movie. After a minute I look behind me to see that the fiancée has vanished. I ask my roommate what the deal is.

Roommate: oh she thinks we’re walking to fast so she’s walking extra slow to make us feel bad

I was shocked he said this so calmly, as if it happens all the time. We get to the movie lineup and start waiting, after a minute or two I see her walking towards us and I can’t describe how dramatically slow she was walking. She finally shows up and says she wants the car keys and that’s she’s going. When asked why she said in front of all these people

F: Well you guys ditched me and left me behind and I feel sad now

My roommate and I both agree that she purposely walked slower so she could be mad at us, to which she said how we don’t care about her. She then turns and almost yells at me 

F: What are you embarrassed by me?!?!

I replied that yes, I was highly embarrassed and that this wasn’t the time nor place to cause such a scene over nothing. I then tell her that her guilt trip tactics and manipulation don’t work on me and not to talk to me until I say. She eventually left and joined later. I walked home instead of getting in the car and we haven’t talked since. I feel bad but also feel like I haven’t done anything wrong.

Throwaway. 

I’m a 20 year old business student working in my first internship as part of my degree program. My hours are 9-5 but I get paid for 7.5 hours with a 0.5 hour lunch break. I have been here 3 weeks and not taken one. The other full time staff here don’t seem to take them everyday but I’d say most of them probably take a lunch break 3 times a week. The first 2 weeks I was here I just didn’t even try to take one cuz I was so anxious. This week, whenever I tried, my supervisor would give me something to do so I’d just go do that instead and maybe eat crackers or a granola bar at my desk. I’m kind of getting tired of never getting real food or a break. AITA for wanting a break especially since I’m not getting paid for the 8 hours I’m putting in, even though I’m just an Intern?

238,e8tp2u,"WIBTA if I ghosted my friend? I have a friend, Ashley, who I met through mutual friends (Denise and Ana).

Earlier in the year I noticed she deleted her Facebook. I messaged her if everything was okay. I didn’t receive a response. Why was I being ghosted? I decided to move on and if she wanted to reach out to me she will. Then a month ago she adds me on Facebook. I added her then noticed her location said Texas. I thought, “did she really move?”. I messaged her. Sure enough she did move. When I messaged her she said it was all last minute. I found out through Denise and Ana that they did know.

Last week Ashley texted me that she will be in town and that we can meet up. Friday comes and she sends a group message to me, Denise and Ana and says she is boarding and “can’t wait to see all of us this weekend”. We all reply with our safe travels and can’t wait to see you messages. The group chat went dead after that. Ashley didn’t text us that she arrived or if we can meet her someplace. Naturally, I thought she was busy with family and I totally understood this. I kept my phone by me all weekend in case. I even told my husband on Saturday that I wanted to reach out to Ashley because I’m keeping my weekend open and didn’t hear anything from her. My husband said not to and that if Ashley wanted to reach out to me, she would. I said okay and left it that way. She didn’t message me all weekend.

I was feeling very down about all of this Sunday morning. I texted Ana and asked if she saw Ashley and she said yes. She said she met her at the airport. Then I asked if Denise saw her. She said yes. I messaged Ashley right after and said ""Hey girl. I know your super busy this weekend with your visit. I was waiting for you to give me details on Friday. I would have met up with you"". No response.

After I sent that message she texted the group chat that she created on Friday and said “So sorry I didn’t spend a lot of time with all of you. Happy Holidays”. I didnt respond. Later on in the day She said, “I’m so sorry. I sent my arrival details on Friday and thought you would reach out if you had time. I know you're always busy and didn’t want to bother you”.

But she didn’t send any arrival details in the group message if that is what she is referring to. Next off, she left the state without even telling me a thing and she expected ME to reach out to HER to meet up this weekend? She is the one who left town! And I found out through Facebook! So yesterday morning Ashley sent me a text. It said ""Hey girl. I'm reaching back out to you because I didn't receive a response from you on Sunday. I'm hoping we are still okay. I hope I didn't upset you or offend you. A lot happened this weekend that I didnt expect. A lot of my initial plans were put off and I apologize if I offended you. Love you"".

WIBTA if I ghost her? I just really feel she is playing games with me. For my mental health, I want to cut off contact with her."
239,9zlwbs,"WIBTA for kicking my girlfriend out on the street? So some background information: me(22m) and her(22f) had been dating on and off for a while, mostly on sometimes off, and it's always been because I've been weary about committing in general, let alone with her.

See I care about her a lot but I get out of the Navy soon and plan on moving and going to college and don't want the baggage. Also I'm not sure I could commit to her longterm because she has no real drive or direction in life(she got a DUI and then got kicked from the navy a year later) and I'm not willing to support her forever. She's really sweet and good to me but can't get her shit together.

Anyhow, me and her were dating but living in seperate apartments. After she got the DUI and kicked out of the service her Insurance and car payments(she bought a brand new car, financially irresponsible I know) were too much for the job she was working so she decided to move back home to afford her car(Neither of us live near any family and her family is 6 hours away in Jersey). Well she was always texting me about it back at home and she was miserable and ended up couch hopping and sleeping in her car. I missed her and thought ""maybe I can help her out and get my girlfriend back for a while by letting her crash with me"". So I asked if she wanted to move in with me rent free until she got a better job and got back on her feet.

She's been with me 2 months now. As a stay-at-home girlfriend she's great but she hasnt made much headway as far as 'getting back on her feet' is concerned. She found a job waitressing but it didnt make good money and she hated it so she quit. I told her not to and to keep the job until she found a better one(since low money beats no money) and she asked if I'd be angry if she quit. YES. I WILL, YOU DON'T PAY RENT AND YOU'RE APPROACHING 90 DAYS DELINQUENT ON ALL YOUR BILLS! She quit anyway and I got pissed and told her that if she doesnt have a job within the next month I was kicking her out with literally nothing going on in her life. 

She doesn't seem to be purposely sucking at life, she gets really stressed about her position and recognizes it's her fault but still makes poor decisions and life choices(like quitting her job when shes in crazy debt)

So Reddit, WIBTA for kicking my girlfriend out of the house with no job or money if she really can't find a job in the next month?"
240,anyhj3,"AITA for turning my back on my best friend? English is not my first language so, also phone so formating may be an issue.

It's more complicated that the title, so, for context, both of us (me (M) and her) had known each other since we were like 7, after some years I lost contact with her.

Some years ago I got to high school and realized she was there too. At the beginning I didn't care much but then I started to like her, so I tried to get close to her by being friendly.

After a month or so we were best friends, yeah that didn't go well for me but whatever she was nice. We had been doing really good, but somewhere between 2018 I realized she didn't quite care about me, just cared about me being there for her. I didn't feel so good about it, so I ran a ""test"" to see what she would do, it was to stop messaging her (because I used to start every conversation) to see if she would notice or message me. After some days I realized it was going nowhere since she didn't seem to care.

From the beginning of our friendship I used to depend on her assistance for my days not to boring, and of course I used to be with her every break time and be with her the entire time, so my next move was not to, just not to and see if she would do something.

This is when it goes to hell, at that time I had good relations with a guy (let's say Kevin) and he happened to be my friend's ex boyfriend, the one she hated the most. From literally a day to another, Kevin was my good friend with who I could spend the break time without thinking about her.

You can now imagine which reaction it caused, she thought I had changed her for him, and she couldn't be further from what it had really happened. I never really told her why I stopped talking to her because I obviously couldn't tell her it was all an ""experiment"" (something she had some with me multiple times) so I just told her the truth, that I hadn't changed her for him, that I was just spending time with him.

Kevin had also warned me numerous times that she was using me for emotional support, now I choose to believe that.

Then, I don't remember when exactly, we both stopped talking to each other.

So, Was ITA for doing that?"
241,d86sk7,"AITA for asking my coworker ''What the fuck is wrong with you?'' aggressively? A coworker of mine, we'll call him David for the sake of it being easier to explain my situation. So me and David grew pretty close and hung out a lot. For about a year, things were fine. We've never argued, we've never had a fight or anything like that.  
We would hang out every other weekend and sometimes after work. Having fun and enjoying each others company.

A few months ago he came to work without saying hello. Something that's good to mention is that I work as a receptionist, so when you leave and come to work, you walk pass me.   
At first I was a bit confused, but didn't think much of it until he, on that same day, avoided me. He would walk pass me quickly and not even look at my direction, ignore me and just go out.  
This happened for a few days and I always called him after work to make sure he was OK, I started getting worried that maybe something had happened that made him sad or so. When we talked on the phone, he was normal. 

As time went by this started happening more and more frequently. Some days he would treat me like a stranger and some days he was back to normal again. This was really hurting me. For a long time I tried to tell myself and think ''Don't take it personally, maybe he's just going through something behind closed doors''. But no, I quickly realized that he was doing this specifically towards me.  
He would treat me like a stranger but with other coworkers, he was himself. Happy, talkative and basically himself. Even to coworkers he barely talked to! And I'm supposed to be one of his closest friends?

We could sometimes hang out on the weekends and as soon as Monday came around, we were back at square 1. Even if he took the initiative to ask me to hang out.

I've tried talking to him about this SEVERAL times, at least 5 times. Telling him how it really hurts me, asking him why, asking him if I've done something and I always got the same answer.  
''I have nothing to be mad about, you haven't done anything''. He would literally laugh and try to sweep it under the rug every time so I eventually gave up.

One day I just looked at him and didn't say hello, he looked me like something was wrong with me and said ''what?'' in a pretty rude way. I then snapped and asked him ''what the fuck is wrong with you? You've been acting like a dick'' in an aggressive tone, but I wasn't loud at all. He has used this as an excuse for his behavior even tho he has done this SO MANY TIMES before I snapped.

This started bothering me so much that I took a step back.

Now days we don't hang out or talk. I've yet to know what I've done wrong. I've been nothing but nice to him. Every time he wanted company for anything, I was there, If he was out late and wasn't able to get home he slept at my place, I helped him clean his house voluntarily for the sake of making it easier for him and I could go on and on.

Am I the asshole for being aggressive about it?"
242,7ahlt3,"AITA for initiating unwanted (by the other person) communication as a result of misinterpreting unknowingly ambiguous language on their part? History of over twenty years of friendship with this person, many of them rocky largely due to me only recently learning how to hold my ground and respectfully stand up for myself when taking shit I don't deserve.

Earlier tonight we'd been trading pleasant, banal texts, mostly about random stuff we'd encountered on the internet. Then she sent me a message saying ""Really fucking angry. Going radio silent now."" I didn't get this text for about a half hour.

I didn't then, and don't now, believe that whatever pissed her off had to do with me. I think I have a good idea what may have happened, based on recent escalating frictions with another person in her house. But she has always experienced emotions in a very big way that easily escape the confines of the immediate trigger and splatter out onto anyone or anything else that may be in the splash zone. In over two decades of close friendship, I have never found a best, or even good, way to respond when she lets me know she's upset. Anything I say usually upsets her more and draws the aggro toward me, but silence meant as respectful has several times seen as the cold shoulder, or me not caring or not wanting to deal with her emotions, etc.

In the absence of any more detail than what she gave, I made a best guess about how to proceed. I didn't think she was mad at me, which meant I could be a support if she later wanted to talk. I didn't know if my half hour of silence up till that point had been wanted or unwanted or neither. So I sent the following:

A half hour after she'd sent hers, I sent ""(<3 no need to respond, just woke up from accidentally dozing off and wanted to say if you want to vent just call me, I'm leaving my phone on loud in case I fall asleep)""

Then a few hours later I could feel myself about to fall asleep and sent this: ""(bedtime for me, therapy in the morning. Sending you love. No need to respond. But don't hesitate to wake me at any hour for just wanting to talk, or anything that might help you feel better. I'm sorry you had to deal with shitty emotional shit on top of feeling like crap physically. I love you.)""

She immediately replied, ""Dude! I said ""radio silence"" because I don't want to talk!""

I put a lot of effort into good communication and considered, ethical behavior. It's high up on my priority list both for myself and the people close to me. Now I realize many terms have different nuance for different people, and if you've only ever heard it used one way, you might not recognize any ambiguity, and proceed accordingly. That's what I did, here, for sure. When I say I'm going radio silent, it means I won't be transmitting, not ""don't text me"". If I additionally want to be left alone, I say that directly.

I think she thinks that she communicated ""leave me alone"" clearly and I disrespected it, but it was not clear to me at all, my own life experience led me to draw a different meaning and act in a way that pressed a button for her which I of course didn't mean to.

I sent one last reply, in both own defense and an attempt to de-escalate or confine whatever bullshit may emanate from this minor misunderstanding. It said: ""I'm sorry, I thought you meant you wouldn't be responding, didn't know it also meant to not send you anything in the meantime. I will take it that way in the future. Shutting up now""

I don't think I'm an asshole. I don't think it's a good excuse when people say ""but I didn't mean any harm"" if they don't go out of their way to avoid doing harm as a regular practice in their life. But I do think innocent mistakes happen, and in a situation where both people have managed to hurt the other one unintentionally somehow (in this case mildly), that a fair resolution involves both parties legit giving a shit that they hurt the other one and apologizing.

Part of what's driving me to post here is that I know from experience how this is likely to go. I'll get reamed a little more until it's out of her system, I'll be expected to take it and just apologize, and if I say anything to defend myself or try to let her know that she also hurt me with the wrong and insulting assumptions behind her snapping at me, it'll just be a Fight fight. When she's hurt, she goes into an uncharacteristically un-self-aware mode where her pain is the only thing that is allowed space in the conversation, she really cannot see how she cuts down anyone else who wants to participate in the conversation in any way other than palliative, and in the moment, can't process or doesn't care about if she managed to do some damage when she was in a compromised state.

I know it must be exhausting living like that, and I have empathy for that part, but damn, we're in our thirties here, this is well past the time when I should have to baby step a grown adult through how to have a calm, sincere, productive conversation about resolving a personal conflict.

Now, I've admitted fault and apologized for pressing the button I didn't know was there, and have left her alone since then and will continue to until she reaches out to me. But I don't know where to go with it after that. This pattern makes me feel like a cranky, voiceless, misunderstood teen-ager. The whole point of making it to adulthood without dying is to not have to deal with this bullshit anymore.

Am I the asshole? Is she? What can I say to her to make her hear that me just apologizing and backing down every time isn't right or good for me, and I need her to muscle up emotionally and be open to tinkering with the mechanics of our communication so that I'm not so frequently left with a bad taste in my mouth, lingering resentment and lack of respect for her communication skills and self awareness?"
243,emze6y,"AITA For not going around the car in front of me at the costco gas pump? I was at the costco gas pumps the other day, because my mom sent me to put fuel in her truck. The layout of the pumps at my local costco is about 6 rows of pumps, so 6 lines of cars, with 2 pumps at each row, one in front the other. So I got to the point where I was the next person in line, and there were 2 people at the pumps in front of me. I'm at the pump on the very far right and theres a low cement wall to my right and the gas pumps are to my left. The person at the front pump must have only put a few dollars in because they left very quickly, before the other car was done. Here comes the delimma. I wouldn't say I'm not confident in my mom's truck, but I'm not super familiar with it (how big it is). In my car I know exactly how big of gaps I can squeeze through, just from experience, but I've only driven this truck a handful of times. So the gap between the wall, and the other car was pretty small. I figured it's probably better to wait two minutes for the car to leave, than to risk damaging my mom's brand new truck. That's when the car behind starts laying on the horn and waiving his arms. I said fuck it, let him honk he didn't have enough of a problem with it to get out of his car so who cares. 2 or 3 minutes passed and the car in front left, so  I got out and pumped, and left. In hindsight, I probably would have made it, but I just didn't feel as if it was a necessary risk. I'm just wondering if i was in the wrong or if the guy was just an asshole? 

TL;DR I was pumping gas at costco and didn't want to risk squeezing through the gap to get to the front pump, and guy behind me started to blare his horn"

246,a52wlq,"AITA For Causing Conflict in my Girlfriend's Family? My (21M) girlfriend's (21F) parents are both from Lebanon, and since she was young, have wanted her to marry a Muslim, Lebanese man. I'm very much not that - I'm white as snow and irreligious. She doesn't want to follow their wishes and was able to break off a marriage her parents tried to arrange for her in the past.  

Currently, she's making a half-hearted attempt to keep our relationship a secret from them. They know when we're out together and pretty much every time she says she's going to hang out with me, they ask her if we're dating, and she's been denying it, but they essentially know. I'm not 100% comfortable with this, but in my mind it's her decision how to deal with this, and because I don't know her parents or their culture I've just let her do her thing. I've told her that we may as well just come clean at this point, but I haven't pushed the issue.  
Of course, her parents aren't happy about this. They've yelled at her a few times over it and have generally expressed their displeasure. Thankfully they've never been violent. The worst that's happened is her dad tried to block her from leaving by standing in the door, but she just left through the back door.  
She says that she doesn't really care what her parents think or about her relationship with them, because as she has said, they try to control her and don't respect her. She's currently trying to move out but that may take a few months. Essentially, she's trying to avoid the drama of her openly dating a white guy until she moves out.  
Now, my parents know all about this, and my dad has essentially labeled me the asshole for causing conflict in her family. Basically, he's told me that, unless I expect to marry her, I should break it off, because family is everything. I have no idea if I'll marry her - we've been dating for a solid four months. In my mind, if I don't marry her and it's not me who causes conflict, it'd be her next boyfriend, unless he's a Lebanese Muslim. (A relevant detail is that I'm her first boyfriend since the guy they tried to get her to marry, who lived on a different continent for 90% of their engagement)  
So I guess my question is twofold - AITA for facilitating her not telling her parents we're dating, and AITA for dating her in the first place when, even if it were open, it would cause conflict with her parents?  
Tl;Dr I'm dating a girl whose parents are Lebanese. She's trying (kinda) to keep it a secret, but her parents basically know, and they are not happy. AITA for helping her keep it a secret, and AITA for dating her in the first place if it causes conflict?"

I live on the third floor of my building and the walls are pretty thick so I don't usual hear anything from the neighboring apartments unless they get pretty loud. Regardless, I just assumed it was someone in the building and it was irritating but I didn't think much of it.

An hour or so later I went out to walk my dog and found the source of the noise was actually a man two or three buildings over who had set up two speakers and was playing his music at top volume. I live in the city and the buildings on my block are lined right up against each other so this actually wasn't much of a distance. Not shocking that I could hear it from my apartment given how loud it was. He was drinking something out of a red solo cup and shouting Happy New Year to everyone who walked by. When I passed him and he said it to me I ignored him, so he repeated himself and then I grumbled Happy New Year and kept walking because I was miffed about the loud music. He said something like ""Is it really that bad?"" but I ignored him and kept walking.

After I finished my dog's walk I felt kind of bad. I found the loud music very annoying but I guess he was just celebrating so I don't know if I was being unnecessarily snarky. I tend to keep mostly to myself and I'm not really an overly friendly neighbor in the first place so I don't know if anyone else would have been more friendly to the guy. "

Every time my procedure got rescheduled my employer would complain how it was fucking with his schedule because he needed me to drive the truck (even though there was someone else who could the whole time. He just didn't want to have them drive.)
Fast forward to this last week, the doctor finally calls me and says someone cancelled and they can fit
me in for a procedure. But it would be in 3 days or I'd have to wait for an entire 2 months. I took it immediately. Telling my employer that I had to do this. And he loses it with the temper. Sending me walls of text asking if I can wait another month for a procedure which I failed to mention earlier, to you the reader (I had mentioned this to the employer) would be checking me for cancer. 
So yesterday I get my procedure done. It turns out my situation was worse then I realized. What was supposed to be a little nodule ended up being my entire left tonsil.
The doctor ends up telling me I can't do any heavy lifting for atleast a week. I tell this to my employer, and he loses it, a wall of text saying how I've ""fucked him over"" and he didn't ""care about my doctors note"" that I'm costing him money and it is unacceptable..very angry texts implying that ""I don't give a damn about your surgery I need you to come to work"". Bare in mind I'm not the only one who can do the job I am needed for. There are several other guys to do the physical work. And atleast one other person properly licensed to drive one of the company vehicles.

I am at a loss. On one level, I have another job that can give me just enough $ to pay my rent and buy food Until I find another job. And I don't  want to return to an employer who at any moment could ""verbally abuse"" me for not prioritizing his business over my health. I plan on quitting and going frugal until a new job comes up. Would IBTA?

TL;DR

AITA For prioritizing my health over my employers business?"
251,ee91fd,"AITA for booking a taxi from a different taxi company? I work as a receptionist for an upmarket hotel somewhere in the UK.

The hotel is situated slap bang in the middle of two counties in a secluded village between 2 hills.  I was asked by a guest to specifically book a 6 seater taxi  for their party as they had just finished Sunday lunch with us. 

They told me that they live up the road ( 4 miles) away, which i will refer to county B, the hotel is on the very outskirts of County A,  County B being 2 miles away. 

Using my own personal knowledge of the local area I booked a taxi from county A using a taxi company that specifically deals with 6 seater cars I know this company is slightly more expensive (however was not sure how much more expensive) because of their specialist nature of cars but are a lot normally quicker than getting a taxi from county B ( the difference is 1 mile). Another note to make is this is not the taxi company the hotel normally uses as default. 

Unfortunately the car that was specifically booked for them took 45 minutes ( normal waiting time is 15-20) due to having a tyre puncture. In this time I called the the taxi company for updates and they promised me twice that the taxi would be 10 minutes ( it arrived 20 minutes later from my initial first call). 

when the taxi was 2 minutes away the guests asked why I ordered a taxi from county A when they said I knew they lived in County B? I apologised and said that they did not specify a taxi company and I told them I got a taxi from a taxi company that was closest to the hotel.  

The taxi finally arrives as they are complaining to me at reception and asking me why I have used said company and they hastily change their tone as the taxi driver opens the front door to let them know he has arrived, saying thank you for the lovely meal e.t.c  that is the last i thought i would hear of these guests. 

I get a call 15 minutes later from said guest telling me that the taxi company had charged them almost double what it normally costs them to get home and was 45 minutes late, and apparently that I had booked a taxi from a company that they would normally never use as it doesn't even normally operate in their county. I did ask the guest why they wouldn't speak to the taxi company directly as i merely booked the taxi nothing else. 

The guest retorted that it was my fault as I had clearly booked the taxi from said company and that it was disgusting that they had charged her so much and that i should have booked a taxi from county B (even though it is a mile further away).  

Am I The Asshole for booking this taxi? 

The guest is now taking out a full blown complaint against me for the taxi I ordered because the taxi company charged her so much and has spoilt her Christmas plans as it also came late."
252,azuyfy,"AITA for changing my mind at a frat party? As a precursor, I was pretty intoxicated and so was everyone else.

&#x200B;

I went to the weekly frat party with a couple of my friends last night. As the party progressed a bit,  I started dancing and making out with some girl that was obviously trying to get with me, and we were about ready to leave. Before we left, one of my friends (girl) was signaling me to come over and meet some of her friends; we made small talk and we all started to dance including the girl I initially met and was going to leave with. 

&#x200B;

Anyways, long story short I ended up ditching the other girl and leaving with one of my friends' friends and I woke up today to a bunch of shit coming my way. Apparently the other girl was in the sister sorority to the frat and apparently told the frat brothers I'm ""a cheating bastard"" and other vulgar comments along those lines...she wasn't too happy that I left and is now perpetually defaming me on social media for no reason at all besides the fact that she's salty, and out of context it sounds really bad. 

&#x200B;

I mean I don't think I did anything wrong, it's not like I committed myself to anything and despite me 'leading her on' or whatever you wan't to call it, its a damn frat party so its not like I'm going on a blind date or anything serious."
253,d028wg,"AITA for not letting my girlfriend get a novelty stamp in her passport in the DMZ? I recently took a trip to South Korea with my girlfriend. One of the highlights of the trip was the DMZ tour we took. On that tour, one of the places they take you is this train station that is supposed to be used for relations between North and South Korea. In practice it is mostly for show, but it is a symbol of reunification.

At this train station, they have a stamp you can get that says the name of the station and Pyongyang, like a ticket between the two locations. Our guide explained no train actually goes to Pyongyang, but it is like a wish for the future. We were told by the guide that we should absolutely not put this stamp in our passports because it could cause problems with immigration officers in both Korea and the USA in particular. There is also a sign next to the stamps telling you not to stamp your passports or currency.

So on arrival in Korea, my girlfriend was upset because they do not stamp your passports on entry/exit. Instead you get a little paper ticket. She has a fresh passport and likes to collect stamps from the places she's been, so she wanted to put the train station stamp in her passport. I said, for the reasons explained above, that she shouldn't do it. She pressed the issue, but I was holding our passports and ultimately refused to give her the passport. Instead, we put the stamp on our itinerary booklet which we have kept as a kind of keepsake.

Additional info:

* We have gotten novelty stamps in our passports before (at Machu Picchu) but I don't think it's the same because the government doesn't care if you go to Peru.

* There was a second stamp that said the train station name and some stuff in Korean I can't read, but it was with the other stamp with the sign that said not to put it in your passport. She asked about only doing this one but I still didn't give her the passport.

* We saw other people putting the stamp in their passport, but I they weren't from the USA (which has banned travel to North Korea), and I don't think other people breaking the rules means it's ok for us to do it.

On the one hand it's not my passport, but on the other hand we always travel together and I would be very upset if we ever got held up by immigration agents over the stamp, potentially missing a flight or generally just being inconvenienced. 

So AITA for not letting her put the stamp in her passport?

**-----EDIT-----**

While I appreciate everyone's feedback, to the people calling my girlfriend dumb, immature, etc. I would like to state that she is none of these things. She was mainly pushing for the stamp with the station name that I described in the additional info, which is probably less risky than the one that says Pyongyang in English. However, because we were still told not to put it in the passport, the minor argument happened. She's a lovely person so please be kind whatever your verdict."

255,aulzij,"AITA for not wanting to share my time with shared kids? A little backstory, my Ex left me about a year and a half ago, we have two children together and she came with two children already. Her eldest decided to remain with me, while her son recently decided to move in with her. The issue I have is she has spent the past year and a half living however she wants, I usually have had the kids. We have joint custody, and things are supposed to be 50/50, but it hasn't worked out like that. After she was caught doing what she did, she rarely saw the children and typically didn't pick them up on her days for a little over a year. Recently she has started to want to see the kids that are with me more, so she does pick them up on her days for a few hours, and then drops them back off. I honestly encourage her picking up the kids and try to help her out on those days as much as possible by being flexible. Now she has begun asking to pick up our shared daughters on some my days and I refuse. She says I am trying to keep them from her but I just want them to have a bit of structure in their lives. I also get told I don't allow the children to see her, but I just don't see it that way. I honestly enjoy my days with our shared daughters, we've built up a routine. I just don't feel I should have to give up my time at all, and I'm getting a lot of anger and guilt both from their Mother as well as her family. Am I being an asshole?

&#x200B;

**Edit:** I apologize for not including some facts. The span of time she barely saw the children (little over a year) was because she didn't pick them up. What she did to end our marriage is just between us, and shouldn't involve children.  On her days I make sure the kids are available and ready to go."

She's done this for years and I've been stressed lately, so I got a little snippy. This is the first time I've messaged her about it, but I replied with ""I do get notifications, just so you know. You don't have to text me each time someone messages me."" Now she's very upset with me, has been spamming my phone, and called me once already.

That was almost a decade ago and we’ve been trying to rebuild our relationship.) 
This is the first time I’ve been invited to Easter lunch in three years and I believe it’s because I’m moving out of the state. Additionally about half the time were together it turns into an interrogation about not liking my life choices and politics and it is extremely unpleasant. Needless to say I do not want to go for those reasons alone but I’m also graduating from law school in three weeks and I have finals I need to study for and the thought of spending three hours at lunch not studying is already stressing me out.

258,c6p8sz,"AITA for not inviting my fiancé’s sister to be my bridesmaid? I, 21F, am getting married to the love of my life in 8 months, we’ve been engaged for 9. I plan to have 6 bridesmaids. These include 3 of my closest friends, 2 of my cousins, and my sister, who is the maid of honour. My fiancé has 6 groomsmen, one of whom is my brother.

My fiancé has 1 older half sister, who is 26. I’ve only met her twice and Im not very close with her. She and my fiance were close as children but now they have grown apart over the past few years. She is still invited to the wedding, of course, along with her husband and 2 kids.

Now, there is some disagreement over her role in my wedding. I picked out my bridal party almost as soon as I got engaged. Last week, my fiance told me that his sister was wondering whether I’d make her a bridesmaid. I told him that I’m only planning to have 6 and that I don’t really know her well enough to make her my bridesmaid. He said that was understandable and told her.

Yesterday, she texted me randomly and said I’m free to do what I want for my wedding, but she just thinks it’s a bit rude that I didn’t even ask her to be a part of my wedding. I told her that my bridesmaids are people who I’m particularly close with, and besides, they all know each other and we live in the same city, while she lives like 6 hours away. Also, I told her that she may not have much in common with them (they are all between the ages of 21-23) and preferably my bridesmaids are unmarried.

She then asked if she could make her daughter, 4, a flower girl. I said I already have a flower girl (a family friend’s daughter). She sounded annoyed after but said she understood.

Today, my fiance told me at breakfast that his sister is very upset I’m not making more of an effort to include her in my wedding. She said something about how I’m superficial and the only reason she’s not included is because she’s not “hot enough” to be a bridesmaid. Yes, my friends are pretty attractive but that’s not the reason why I didn’t include her! I’m just not that close with her and she wouldn’t mesh well with the other girls.

My fiance says I should consider making her daughter a co-flower girl, just to appease her. I said I’ll think about it. He says ultimately it’s my decision but I need to act like the bigger person here. AITA?"

260,c50s4i,"AITA for refusing to pay for my step-daughter's expenses after she got pregnant? My husband was a teen dad, we will refer to his daughter as An. An's mom, grandma and ggrandma were all teen moms. An is now 16 years old, and pregnant.

An stays mostly with us because I am the one who pays (most of– 75%) her private high school tuition. It had always been my husband who pays for An's expenses.

When An turned 14 she wanted to move in with us to start her high school(HS) in the big city we live in. We checked on HS and since public school is terrible here, we decided to enroll her in a fancy private HS. She has always been set that she wanted to be an economist, and that she wanted to move to another country to pursue her dream. I have been separating some money for this purpose, too.

My husband and I came to an agreement that I would also help her dream to come true, but I would cease any economic help towards her tuition if she became a teen mom (An did NOT know this) and he agreed. This conversation took place two years ago... And now, An is pregnant as soon as she finished her first year.

I laid some facts down to An, gave her some articles and statistics about how teen moms are one of the most vulnerable groups of people, that this will hinder her dream of going to another country to study and that she knows the stigma it comes with. I recommended she terminated the pregnancy.

An's mom is ECSTATIC and so is her grandma. They have this weird belief where they think they can make it for so much better for her than it was for them because of ""all the experience"". I think they're absolute loonies; I bet they don't even have the money to pay for the hospital when the time comes. I believe they think we will pay for all of the unborn child's costs.

I am dead serious about stopping tuition and using the money I've been saving in other stuff if An decides to carry on with the pregnancy. I have NOT and will NOT make the ultimatum of ""terminate or I'll stop paying your tuition"", but I will tell her that I won't pay for her nice school and her child's expenses if she decides she wants to keep it. I don't even want to become one of those grandmas who take care of the child. I firmly believe a normal teen life has to be child-free. Money will go to some of the child's expenses and I will give no more. An can either enroll in a public high school (or one within her dad's budget) and set herself for a uni scholarship under dad's budget.

My husband is telling me I need to understand the situation. I do not and will not endorse this teen mom dynasty in any way, this is the hill I will die on. I can actually continue paying for her fancy high school, saving (a lot less) for the uni, and  some of the future child's expenses too, but I feel like I'll be rewarding her for being irresponsible and fucking myself over something I shouldn't. Husband firmly believes I am doing this to punish An and I am being an ass for compromising her future over this matter. AITA?

&#x200B;

**Edit/Commonly asked questions:** Ann will NOT stop attending high school- she will just stop attending the fancy private school. I will use that same money to finance some of the child's caring, but I also feel this is not my baggage and has to be something bio mom and dad have to solve themselves (I still need to make a budget, but I don't think I will pay the full $1000 equivalent of tuition a month on child support, bio mom has to pay at least something once in her life).

No, I will NOT make an ultimatum. I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO ANN ABOUT THIS SITUATION. I plan on telling her I can't support fancy high school + child support, but not both. She STILL will be able to attend a less prestigious school, not a bad one but not the best, that her father would finance. If father and bio mom want fancy high school, they should pay them themselves.

I will definitely NOT pay for the private university. The country's private universities tend to give scholarships, she could apply for one. I AM NOT CLOSING HER EDUCATIONAL OPTIONS. I may not be giving her the best (the money for her to go to LSE, for example) but I am not giving her the worst.

Finally, the father of the upcoming child is a young man she met in some of her extra activities outside of school. Parents said they would pay for child support, but unless this teen gets a part time job (part time jobs here to high school students pay around 200 a month), the parents will only be able to give $300 a month. That would cover a month of 5hour/5days a week daycare.

**Another edit because forgot to add:** Ann was supposed to be on the pill. Gyn recommended the pill instead of an implant because of some reproductive issues bio mom has. She stopped taking the pill because mom told her she would get fat and then proceeded to *educate her* on the ""natural"" way, as in having sex before, during, and some days after her period. Husband and I have been teaching her sex-ed since she got her first period when she was 11, but I'm fearing of bio mom's teachings, and at this point I just want to fist fight bio mom."

T: best teacher 

Prom is in April every year at our school and you have to buy tickets in advance, so people asked a few months earlier and not the day before. 

I have been in yearbook for 2 years. I sit next to this dude that I will call D. D had been hinting about going to prom with ""Did you buy a prom dress?"" and ""Have you bought a ticket?"" I had not because I did not plan to go. I had made plans to hang out with my dudes and play video games and eat Chinese food. It was cheaper and Chinese taste better than Walmart finger foods on a platter. I told him no for about 3 days until IT happened.

Me: Come on guys! We have faces to tag and only a week to do it! (Book was due in a week and they procrastinated. A lot.)
D and T are talking in the closet.
D:(brings out a flat white box and everyone whips out their phones) So Sbp? Are you still not going to prom.
Me: yep
D: What about with me? (Opens the box with a cookie cake saying ""Sbp? Prom?""
Me: D. I told you already I have plans and no interest in prom. No.

He knew I made these plans for months BECAUSE I INVITED HIM TO JOIN US! 
Me: T I am out! I am hiding in the bathroom, Good bye! 
I waved and walked out.

I go into the bathroom across the school and find R1 and R2 hiding in there. We chat as I know them pretty well and they basically agree that I shouldn't go if I do not want to, but should maybe think about it. T walks in and tells me how D is ""heartbroken"" and that I should think about it and say yes. I say that I am not going with him; she says it is my decision and mine only.

I pop my head in the door to find them talking about hair. Of all things why hair? So I listen to stories of fake hair and sit down.

D: so did you change your mind?
Me:No. I told you I had plans and you knew that.
D: just cancel them and come to prom with me!
Me: No, but you can join me.
D: Why won't you just cancel your plans? You could hang out with them anyday but you can come to prom with me once!
Me: I said no!
D: Well girl said you are a horrible person for telling me no and your little sister said she was gonna hurt you.

Me: I would love to see her try.

262,aq84b8,"AITA for telling a guy I've been dating for about a month that I'd rather work on Valentine's Day than hang out with him, even after finding out his elaborate and romantic plan? I met ""Jeremy"" about a month ago on Tinder. We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a ""fireworks at first sight"" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. 

I saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. 

I'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  

He then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.

This morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. 

I'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?

This big ol' catastrophe happened 4 years ago and my Dad, his Wife, and my Brother haven't seen or spoken to them since. Even though they've apologized numerous times for using the picture, and have sent them Birthday/Christmas gifts yearly.

I met them while in university in 2017/2018, but since September of 2019 I have moved back home. However just recently this month, they proposed we all live together. 3 of the 4 of us were in a band together, so the idea was 'the band is back together and we will live together', however I was happy living back at home after the band had finished and had no interest in living with them or in that city again (I would also seriously struggle to afford the rent there).

I said that it sounds cool but wasn't really up for it, and that I'd need some time to save up, but they were all up for moving in literally STRAIGHT AWAY (I'm talking at the end of the month). One of them kept phoning me and would keep telling me how amazing it would be if we all lived together as a band, and kept countering me eveyrtime I'd say I didn't want to move in. Plus I was already doing my own music thing back home and I had no interest in living with them again (one of them was a bit of a dick and control freak when we lived together).

They kept telling me that I should go for it and 'carve a new life for myself' and 'leave my parents' home' etc, to the point where I literally felt horribly pressured into it, and they wouldn't stop trying to convince me - it was relentless and draining. I had personal reasons which I told them, but they just disregarded it and replied with 'yeah but isn't music your dream? Let's do it'.

I talked to another friend and also my dad on the phone in two different calls, and they both thought that I was just being used in this situation and that I didn't owe them anything. My dad was actually horrified in the way they were talking to me, with them completely disregarding my wellbeing and situation, and them just assuming that I'd love to live with them, and if I didn't then I was letting them all down.

It got to about 4am and I was physically so anxious over it I couldn't sleep. I'd said I wasn't moving in but they weren't happy, so I eventually went through my phone and blocked all 3 of them on every social media I have, with absolutely no intention of talking to them again anytime soon.

My long-time girlfriend and I are currently having the biggest argument we've had in a while. And it sounds silly to say it, but it's over a friggen ALARM in the morning.

So for the longest time (we've been together for almost 6 years now) my girlfriend has set multiple alarms in the morning to get herself up before work. An example would be 6, 620, 640, then 7 where she will frantically wake up and rush to get ready, while other mornings the second alarm might get her out of bed. They wake me up every time and sometimes I have a hard time getting back to sleep when I don't have to get up until later. This makes me super grumpy, and in the past I have yelled at her to wake the f up and turn her other alarms off. Recently, I've asked her to only set one alarm and to just get out of bed when that goes off. This is where the fight started, and it has been going for about a week now.

She was considerate enough to at least try this but says that she has been late to work the past few days due to snoozing the alarm and falling back asleep for too long without another alarm to wake her up. Her argument is that the one alarm doesn't wake her up enough to get her out of bed, and that she has been doing this for years, so why am I getting upset all of a sudden? Today she polled some of her friends and coworkers and found that 5 of them set 3 or more alarms in the morning, and that sometimes they still snooze through them. In my defense, I work shift work and every other week have to wake up earlier than her. I set one alarm and get out of bed with that first alarm every day.

So up to here I might have made myself sound like the rational one, but here's the part where I'm thinking I might be the asshole. Last night she tells me that it's not working for her and she wants to go back to setting multiple alarms because it's making her late for work. I tell her she's being selfish (which did not go over well) and that she should keep just the one alarm and actually wake up when she plans to. I feel like she is prioritizing her snoozing over my actual sleep time. Basically I'm not budging on my demand for one alarm and this is infuriating her. Am I the asshole?"
266,envdu3,"AITA For Not Cleaning The Roof of a Rental Home? To be clear, husband (H) & I are the tenants in this situation. We've been renting this house for 5 years. Honestly, I think we're pretty close to perfect tenants. We pay our rent on time, we make all basic repairs ourselves, and really only contact our landlord (LL) for major or emergency issues. 

FYI, he's raised our rent twice since we moved in. We have at least a year to go before we can move out. 

The problem is we have a ton of trees around the house. We've asked LL to do something several times. He's had a couple of dead trees taken down but ignored the rest. His response is always that it's a ""wooded lot"". Several tree people have told him there are many others that are still a hazard and should be removed. The gutters are pretty much shot and don't drain well. 

Our lease says we're responsible for yard maintenance & pest control. Nothing about the roof. With the amount of leaves & branches that fall on the roof constantly, H's been cleaning the roof & clearing out the gutters 2x a year, anyway. Simply b/c we know the LL never will. And, if we don't, we get spiders and bugs. 

Recently, we asked LL for new carpet inside the house. The light beige carpet that's here now was, according to the LL, put in brand new when he bought the house. That was 10 years ago. We've gone through 3 steam cleaners trying to maintain it but it's now coming apart at the seams and just disintegrating. 

LL said he'd do it after the holidays. He contacted us about coming over to measure rooms a week ago. We gave him a day with a 3 hour time frame, and he said he'd be here. We waited 2 1/2 hours, then he texted and said he couldn't make it. H went ahead and measured and sent him the info. Nothing back. Yesterday, H texted LL to follow up. 

LL called him and basically went into a nuclear meltdown about how he actually drove over here but saw how ""horribly"" the place was being maintained, so he decided it wouldn't be a good idea to come in while he was in that state of mind. He said there were leaves and branches all over the yard, the roof was covered, and the whole place looks trashy. H explained that 1) it's winter, and, 2) he just cleaned the roof 2 months ago. He also said the roof isn't really our responsibility plus it's impossible to keep it clean year-round with all the trees. LL responded saying that the leaves and branches fall under ""yard care and maintenance"". He went on and on, talking about how he shouldn't have to pay for a ""comfort upgrade"" while we're not even taking care of ""basic maintenance"". 

We're obviously very offended and mad. We'll clean it once more to get our carpet. I know LL doesn't have a legal leg to stand on, but AITA (or we) if we just decide to stop cleaning the roof after that... and start barely ""maintaining"" the yard? Especially as we get closer to our move-out date? I'm also tempted to repaint everything back to the former avocado green and beige colors, too."
267,dynygk,"AITA for selling my switch? Ok so this is something I just need a third opinion on. 

Back in roughly the summer of 2018 (I don't remember when exactly) a close friend of mine, along with me and a couple of friends, were in the mall and we were in GameStop. My friends are all Nintendo nerds and I think I was the only one without a switch at the time. I was interested in getting one but I was concerned about the price and whether I would play it or not. This is when my close friend asked me if I wanted it and when I told her what I mentioned earlier she went ahead and bought me the switch. I obviously was very appreciative but I couldn't justify her dropping 300 dollars on me. So along with buying the games for it, I also payed her 200 dollars so I wouldn't feel as bad. 

Fast forward to around a month ago. I have hardly used my switch (I'm talking once every two months I'll boot it up) and me and my close friend who bought it for me have played together all around 5 times since she bought it for me even after I paid for online. I'm obviously not upset about it since she runs her own YouTube channel doing animations along with going to school. So when another close friend of mine mentioned that he wanted a switch I offered mine including games for 200 dollars. This was a massive discount since the switch itself cost 300 and all the games i gave him we're around 200 all together. 

Now it's today. I had sent the friend who bought me the switch a funny video of the new sword and shield Pokemon game when she asked me if I had the game. I said no I didn't and she told me to buy it. That's when I told her that I sold it. She then proceeded to get angry at me saying that she couldn't believe that I sold the gift that she got me. I tried to explain that I had hardly even played with her for the last year and i figured that my friend would definitely use it more than me but she was not having it. Then she proceeded to get upset with me for presumably making a profit when in actuality I did not (I paid 200 dollars back to her and paid 200 for games while selling it for 200 dollars all together. I actually lost 200 dollars in this) However when I tried to explain that she said that she didn't want to hear it. 

AITA here?"

I have the flu. I feel super I'll and I haven't been sleeping properly so I'm exhausted too. I usually finish at 10 but was asked if I could stay till 12. I said unless the rest of the team will all have to stay hours late to finish the work (like 1 or 2am) I'd rather go home as I domt feel well. 

However my Supervisor is also unwell. He thinks he has tonsillitis. His shift ends at midnight and had has said he will not be staying later than that as he feels ill and anything that isn't done will have to be picked up in the morning by day shift.

269,brtar6,"AITA for not wanting to take care of my niece?   

Hi all. I’m an 18-year old student who’s currently studying and in the process of completing my final exams. Unfortunately, I have not been able to work at peak performance for these exams due to the situation that I have partly put myself in. The situation is that I have become a major guardian for my 9-year old niece. I have had to sacrifice a lot of my time in order to take care of her. I have also had to suffer a lot of situations where I have been shouted at and insulted after trying to defend my niece.

The parent of my niece (my sister) flew back to her home country after having an argument with my dad. I recall having to wrestle a knife out of her hands after arguing with my other sister as well. I also remember having nightmares and panic attacks after the incident. I believe that incident happened early last year. The niece has since been at my parent’s house, whilst her mum has been away. 

Throughout this academic year, I have been the main person that has been signing my niece up to after-school clubs, picking her up from school, having meetings with teachers, and making her lunch. I have also been the person who she talks to about any concerns she has in school or at home. Whenever she was crying, I have been the one there to comfort her and ensure that everything’s alright (neither her grandmother nor her aunt seem to care). I have been the one to make sure she gets home on time and I have had multiple occasions where I had to run from my school to hers so that I can pick her up on time – even though other people were available at the time. I have had to miss on after-school revision sessions just to pick her up from school.

Early this year, me and my sister had an argument. This argument started when my niece was crying. My sister told her to decide what food she wanted, and because my niece did not want her food, she began shouting at her. I left my bedroom and told my sister that I’ll make her food (which my niece wanted). This caused my sister to get mad at me and she started shouting at me. She got up to my face, screaming at the top of her lungs, calling me a bitch and insulting me. She said that she’d “call the police on me” for assaulting her – when all I did was stand between her and my niece. I told her to call the police then, as I had recorded the entire exchange on my phone. She promptly left the house and came back with her boyfriend, slamming my bedroom door. I told my mum and dad (who were on holiday at the time) and showed them the video. They proceeded to do nothing about it ultimately.

It just seems like I’m the only one who gives a damn about my niece ultimately. My dad told me that I should not “act like a dad” to her, but am I just suppose to ignore her whenever she has issues like everyone else? It just seems like I either take care of my niece and have my mental health and deteriorate, or give up on taking care her and let her fend for herself. AITA?"
270,e67euj,"WIBTA if I no longer invite BIL to be a part of our daughters life? Trigger warning! Infant Loss

Ok so this is pretty long so bear with me. The first thing I feel I should say is that my husband 100% agrees with me.

So let me just preface this by saying that hubby and I have been married for five years and we decided to start a family right away. A month after being married I discovered I was pregnant and it was a huge deal to me as I had previously been told that fertility might be an issue for me and even more so because I had a miscarriage with a previous partner. 

Fast forward 9 months and we had our firstborn son in our arms. He was with us for four and a half months before he passed away from SIDS (that was the only explanation they were able to give us as he was fine and asleep then gone about five minutes after) we spent 2 days in the hospital running tests and whatnot before they pronounced him brain dead and we decided to let him rest. Needless to say it was all very painful and even more so when family decided to make it about themselves.

Fast forward some more and we announce we were pregnant with our daughter. At first everyone was happy for us and offering to help with whatever. I was about 8 months pregnant when BIL drunkenly calls me to take the kids to get fireworks for some nieces and nephews (they ended up getting candy if that’s important) so I stayed to supervise and talk for a while. Well BIL starts to rant about how he loved my son and I killed him and how I didn’t understand how much pain he was in. How he was never going to help out with our daughter and how he’d rather throw his own daughters’ outgrown things away than to pass it on to us. 

I’ll spare you the rest of the vile things he said. Of course no one was ever going to be as hurt or as afraid as us the parents but after some time I let it slide after much peer pressure from other family members.

Well it’s been 3 years now and a few weeks back we went to BIL’s house where he got drunk again and started saying insane, stupid things to both my husband and I. Now during these three years he hasn’t been outright rude to our daughter and has even gotten her a couple of things but in his last conversation with me he made it very clear that he has no love for her and never will because he can not get over our son passing although he has (in his words) “finally decided to let our son rest for his fifth birthday” as if he were doing us some sort of favor. 

Well I’ve finally had enough of all his BS and trash talking our family and decided that if he has no love for our daughter then she doesn’t need him in her life. She doesn’t have any sort of relationship with him because she’s afraid of him ( I genuinely think she can sense that he doesn’t care for her) and only willingly goes to him if he bribes her with sweets and even then she does that hesitant. 

P.S. this does not mean I plan to exclude his wife or kids from any life events that involve our family like birthdays or whatever.

So WIBTA if I exclude only BIL from our daughters life?"

272,ano0pk,"AITA for continuing to be with my s/o this one is quite a big read so I’ll be sure to put a summary toward the end, while explaining the entire situation I’ll try to be as clear and unbiased as possible (we all like to play the victim and I’m here to figure out if I’m in the wrong, doing that wouldn’t help me) 

let’s start this off at the beginning, I was a freshman and at first just wanted to get laid after being dumped, I got in touch with an old chick friend (who we’ll call Breanne) and hit on her a bunch 

long story short I accidentally ended up falling in love, and she did as well, we wanted to get serious with our relationship so I proposed to meet her mother

her mom wasn’t actually her mom, she sorta “adopted” Breanne, it’s kinda complicated but her mom did this with a bunch of kids like Breanne who were living in shitty households, she’s currently at 11 kids (about 2 or 3 are biologically hers I believe) 

anyways at our first meeting we both hated each other, I honestly can’t explain it but it’s as if in past lives we were king and queen of opposing sides of a war

we met at some cafe in the tourist-y part of the city, where she had a friend waiting along side her who was apparently a cop and threatened to detain me should I upset either of them, I honestly had to hold back my laughs because up until this point I never met a real life r/iamverybadass 

anyways me and Breanne decide to see each other more often, by this time I was a sophomore 

we started meeting up after school to uh... *preform non-christian* acts at my house while everyone was out, then she would take the bus home

admittedly it was a real immature thing to do but I really didn’t care, in fact if I could go back and do things differently *giggity* I wouldn’t, I don’t regret a single thing I did, except for maybe a few bad pick up lines here and there 

because of all the sneaking around Breanne’s mom took away her phone and severely limited contact that me and Breanne would do... which lead to even more sneaking around

again, an immature and dumb move but we were horny 16 year olds

it got to the point where the only way to see and talk to her was to sneak out at 2am and walk two miles to her house to hang out for a few hours only to return home at around 6am 

eventually though I stopped going because she had dudes patrol the area looking for me to sneaking around 

this led to her (temporary) victory, a whole two years pass with little-to-no contact between me and Breanne 

it’s around this time her mom had been diagnosed with cancer, a form that made it so she couldn’t do much without steroids, it was present earlier but had now gotten to its worst (and still getting worse) stage, I wanted to back off because of this, I honestly did, but my love for Breanne was too strong 

I got fed up and called my do or die buddy egg, the kind of friend you can call on for anything, a best friend, I wanted him to come with in case things got real, besides Breanne’s mom always has some guy or that cop chick doing her talking for her, I just wanted some emotional support

I came over and decided to alpha it up, I stood outside her gate and played careless whisper until I got someone’s attention 

when she came out, her mom deadass kicked her out, right then and there, with the clothes on her back and no shoes

she had to spend the night at my house before her mom showed up begging for her to come back

we had planned it out in case she got kicked out permanently, she would live with me and my mom whilst getting her diploma, then a job, then a place with me 

now she lets us talk, and lets Breanne come over from time to time (mainly because she clearly can leave for good at any time, especially now that I’m inches away from my diploma and a apartment with egg where we mine crypto on the side) 

she’s only once tried to make amends with me, at thanksgiving where she invited me over for dinner (where she didn’t talk to me and avoided me) 

and I just need to know, am I the bad guy here? is there even a bad guy? 

summary: mom with cancer doesn’t want me dating her daughter but I want to anyways and will go to great extents to be with her "
273,dclyos,"WIBTA for calling out a thief in a petty way? So my partner and I finally kicked out a nightmare roommate and I think things are going to be great. Turns out he took half the kitchen, leaving only rusty pots and pans. I know for a fact that I had brought some quality cookware when I moved in. I'm also fairly positive my single father partner had more than one cookie sheet in the whole apartment. I couldn't make an itemized list, but I know there's a lot missing. 

After it seemed the roommate completely moved out, we sent him a text asking for the key back. No response. So WIBTA if I posted on his FB page saying something like ""hey, since you didn't answer any pms, posting here. I'm assuming it was an accident because we didn't peg you for a thief, but you took a good amount of my cookware.""
Then something akin to getting financial compensation, I guess.

I suppose it's petty but I'm currently dealing with some problems with my medication and have been overreacting, so I'm trying to suss out what the right thing to do is. Any help would be appreciated."
274,e09z56,"AITA for asking for ""cheap"" Christmas gifts? I am the oldest of 2 kids. Since the divorce the largest amount of money our parents spend on us all at once is at Christmas and birthdays. They have always had a rule, they each will spend the exact same amount on both of us to avoid potential hurt feelings. This has worked out well in previous years when we were kids and they gave us a toy catalog and told us to pick whatever we wanted, but as we've gotten older this has proved problematic.

I'm 17, and in sixth form. My brother has said to me that as he is doing his GCSEs next year (he's 14) he needs a really good laptop, which I understand. He said he was going to ask for a macbook, and the model he wanted was £1,200. He asked me if I could ask for a similar amount, but I told him I objected to this for a few reasons, the main one being that I do not need £1,200 of stuff.

I have a job and I bought myself a cheap laptop this time last year. I got a refurbished one in a sale for about £150, with the price of a brand new one being closer to £500. My next big purchase was going to be my reading list for one of the A Level courses I'm taking. It came to about £150 total so when dad asked about Christmas I asked him to cover my booklist. He had an old gift card and a promo code that he used when purchasing and knocked about £50 off the total. There was a jumpsuit I asked for which cost £60, and when he asked if there was anything else I wanted I also asked for a gift set from lush which came to £25ish and a candle for £15. So the total dad spent on me is around £200, which got me 6 books, a jumpsuit, a gift set and a large candle.

My brother got mad at me. He said that I'd screwed him over because I'd asked for £200 of stuff, so now dad was only willing to spend £200 on him. I, gently, told him that I'd gotten my laptop for less than £200 around this time last year, and he could just ask for a cheaper laptop.

He says it's about the principle of the thing. He specifically asked me to request a certain amount of stuff so he could ask for a similarly priced item, but instead I asked for 1/6 of the amount, effectively giving my brother a £200 cap in the process.

I responded that £200 is still a decent amount of money, he shouldn't get greedy about it, and if he wants a laptop so bad he can find one for less than £200 in the sales or get a used/refurbished one like I did.

He went to mum about it and she agreed that the macbook is too much, but says I need to have his back with dad. If he asked me to spend a certain amount so he could get his laptop then even if I didn't spend the amount he wanted me to then I still could have suggested other, cheaper laptops to him or asked for even a small amount more, as anything would get him closer to the amount he wanted. She also said she was willing to talk to dad and split the cost, but even that wasn't possible with what I asked for.

Recently, my mom told me that I have no reason to be depressed since I “live in a gorgeous house and have a good family with good parents”, and when I told her that nothing will change how I feel (because depression is a chemical imbalance in the brain), she called me and ungrateful bitch. She also called me an ungrateful bitch when the doctor diagnosed me with depression, which was two years ago. She completely ignores how I feel about any situation, and when she screams at me and tells me I’m a waste of space, she says she tells me that because she loves me. So earlier, I asked her why she doesn’t treat me like a daughter. I asked her if she actually meant everything she said, and when she said no, I went on a tangent about why that’s not the correct way to parent. I told her that maybe i’d be “less ungrateful” if she treated me like a human instead of a psychological experiment.

276,ci8wnw,"AITA for not allowing a man to bring his dog in my house?  I have an at home daycare. Now, I do have a dog, but I keep him completely separated from the kids and the areas I use for my daycare, the dog has never been in and he will never be in. The kids don’t play with him or any of that. He’s not dangerous or anything, he’s well trained, has never bitten anyone in his life, it’s just a liability thing. Also, I’ve found that parents are more relieved this way, even dog owners themselves. I have one child in my care, that is also allergic to several things, including dogs. So even if we were to previously allow it, I would stop for his benefit.

Anyway, one of my new kids is occasionally picked up by his grandfather. The other day, I answer the door to let him in and in runs a tiny, furry dog. The little boy that’s allergic (he’s very aware of his allergies and will tell you flat out “I can’t have xyz”) jumped back and screamed. I told the grandpa “You cannot bring this dog in here.” The grandpa gave me a weird look and put the dog on my porch, shutting the door. I explained that the child has allergies and the grandpa said, “Not to my dog, it’s hypoallergenic.” Okay, yeah, maybe but not taking a risk. Then he says “That’s my service dog.” I’ve never seen this guy with a dog before. I asked him to please not bring the dog.

Some time later, he comes to pick up again, dog is with him and runs inside. Allergic Kid freaks out. This time his mom is there picking up and gets pissed. The grandpa says “Yeah, well she has a dog.” The mom says “Yeah, but her dog is never around the kids.” He once again repeats it’s a service dog. I said that he can’t pick and choose (sometimes he comes without dog), he said he has the paperwork and I said I don’t care, it’s my private property, please do not bring this dog back.

This guy’s daughter (mother of the child I watch) called me all upset, saying her father is threatening to not pick up her kid and she doesn’t know what to do. Can’t I just let the dog thing go? I told her no and said the grandpa is welcomed back, but his dog is not. She said I was making things difficult.

I do feel for her, I truly do. But I have to try to make everyone happy here. Am I being an asshole?"
277,bybp7r,"WIBTA if I cared more about my cat than my dad's wedding? My parents divorced when I was 18, right before I left for college. My dad has been having a relationship with another woman since I was \~13-14, continuing even after my mom found out and he promised to stop. Understandably, my mom still pretty much hates him. I currently live with my mom and have a better relationship with her than with my dad, but I get along with my dad well enough too. He’s still seeing the same woman. Now, about 8 years after the divorce, my dad and his partner are going to get married. 

I can’t stand this woman. I have nothing in common with her and find her obnoxious. I always try to be polite and cordial with her, because the divorce wasn’t wholly her fault and realistically I only dislike her because of the circumstances, but I genuinely dislike spending time with her and I’m sure she and my father can tell. 

I’ve been invited to their wedding and would be taking part in the ceremony. I don’t want to go - apart from not liking his fiancee and her family, I’m a true introvert and hate large gatherings of any kind - but I would suck it up and attend for his sake if it wasn’t for one thing. 

The wedding is on a major holiday weekend, meaning my mom, an avid traveler, will be out of town. That would leave no one at our shared home to look after our cat for 3-4 days. This cat is my best friend. Maybe that’s silly, but it’s true, and his happiness and wellbeing is very important to me. He’s a former abandoned stray and extremely anxious - hates other animals, hates being transported in his carrier, hates loud and unfamiliar noises, hates when we leave him alone in the house for more than a few hours. I can’t kennel him, it would traumatize him. My mom is very neurotic about having strangers in the house and refuses to even consider a pet sitter we don’t know personally. Neither of us have many friends or relatives to ask, and we can’t come up with anyone we know to watch him. Leaving him alone would be negligent, boarding him would be cruel, hiring someone is off the table and I can’t ask my mom to sacrifice one of her rare vacations to spare the feelings of the ex-husband she hates. I just don’t see what the good option is. 

I floated the problem by my dad and while he didn’t state it outright, I can tell he’s either offended or hurt. He implied that I’m too sensitive and worry too much about my cat. Maybe that’s true, I worry too much about a lot of things. He also insinuated that staying home would be less for the cat’s sake and more about me ‘punishing’ him and my dislike for his fiancee. I’d like to think that’s not true, since I am genuinely worried about my cat, but I can see why he would feel that way. It would be like saying I care more about my cat being comfortable for a few days than his major life event. WIBTA if that were true?"

My cousins and I found this funny; adults did not. A few hours later, after dropping everyone off, my mom told me the comment was uncalled for and I had embarrassed her. Which was the point.

279,e5vnqh,"WIBTA for not ""doing"" Christmas this year, and making my loved ones spend it alone?  So, as background – my family is incredibly homophobic, and I had not interacted with them for years until I got in contact with my mother last year. She has been sweet and supportive since then, but last Christmas--when I took my husband and son for the holidays--the entire family (besides her) was passive aggressive and cold, even to my then-three year old son. So I didn't spend Thanksgiving with them this year, even though my disabled mother had moved across the country to be closer to me, and was unable to attend without anyone to take her. 

For the past month, I have been getting messages from family members than I am a horrible person and will go to hell for keeping my mother away from her family (who couldn't be bothered to come pick her up themselves, by the way). They are now trying to guilt me into coming back for Christmas this year, and even saying I am a bad father for keeping my son away from them, even though none of them (again, except my mother, I am not angry with her) have put any effort into ever interacting with him, even the few times he was there. My mother is very upset by all of this, and has broken down crying a few times over it. 

Anyway, we ended up spending Thanksgiving with my husband's family, which wasn't much better. No, they aren't homophobic, and they actually treat our son like a person who is there, but they are still incredibly passive aggressive, constantly, and his mother kept making shitty comments to my mother about irrelevant bs. His uncle and dad also wouldn't drop the fact he makes money as an artist while his cousin is an \~accountant\~ which isn't even impressive. Not to mention the fact my husband acts so fake around his family, it kills me. Like, puts on this deep, monotone “straight” voice. Who's benefit is that for? It's so irritating, I hate his damn family. 

So this year, I'm not going anywhere. I will open presents with my son and husband (and mother, if she decides to come over), but I'm not going to his or my family's houses. I feel bad about my mother having to spend another holiday alone, and my husband either staying home or having to spend an evening with his family alone. Which is probably what would happen, since his parents would be pissed if we didn't bring our son over.   

So, WIBTA for making my husband and mother spend Christmas alone because I don't want to have to deal with it?"

So me and my gf been together for about 3 years . She always has been a very jealous and insecure person, to the point where if I don’t show her my Snapchat or any social media I get accused of “hiding something “. We used to have each others passwords, But I said no to that over a year ago as It was getting unhealthy. However , one thing I can’t seem to come terms with her is the location thing. I find her always checking it and asking me and questioning me where I was to the point it’s bothersome. I guess she checks it to see if I’m at some girls house ? About a few months ago I turned it off and swore that I’m not putting it on. She WENT OFF on me after I turned it off and saying “if I loved her I’d put it on “.  She said that she only checks it when I don’t reply and it makes her feel better.

282,ejbzfb,"WIBTA if I continue to ignore my father after a heartfelt apology - despite being 3 years late I could really go into details regarding what led me cutting my dad out of my life but that probably wouldn’t be the most enjoyable. Basically my dad left me and my sister (at the time I was a junior in high school and she was in eighth grade) during my mother’s deployment to pursue an affair. 

During this time my sister and I learned how to grow up fast and had to manage money and finances as my moms deployment was no where near over. 

We did everything for ourselves and fully accepted that my father had started a new life without us. 

My parents fought a lot upon my mothers return, and my dad manipulated my mother a lot into believing they would get back together. (she suffered from ptsd and depression at the time) 

I’m a sophomore in college now and my parents got divorced my senior year of high school when my dad bought a house to live with his mistress in and provide for her son- it’s a small house and he didn’t have rooms for me and my sister so I just stopped coming around, my sister has always been closer to him so she continues to put effort into their relationship 

He didn’t attend my high school graduation and hasn’t talked to me since I stopped coming around, today 3 years after he left me and my sister I get a long apology in the form of text begging me to see him(I’ve heard he isn’t doing well in terms of health) - the apology was very heartfelt and I’m sure is genuine but I can’t help but still despise him WIBTA if I just don’t respond ?

story: today no one came to work on the project for the exception of the team mate who actually helped a lot in this project but had to leave due to some complications I wont get into (he had a good reason). after a whie of asking if anyone is in uni or if they are at least coming no one would answer. now I am pissed but I would have been happy to work on it alone if everyone actually did there part correctly. even tho some team mates helped we were all supposed to do some work and it ended up being a slacking work (except for the guy who brought all the items). seeing as no one cares anymore and i'm moving majors I thought I should just give up and drop the easiest course ever but I feel like it's undeserving for the ones who worked well. so WIBTA if I drop the course with no remorse and leave everything up to them? or should I stay in it because I payed and regardless of what happens I should just do the work and be done with it asap?"
284,de1yl0,"AITA for saying that my mother doesn’t understand my period Those of you who think I’m being unreasonable hear me out.

I started my period when I was eleven and from day one it was like hell on earth. Vomiting, trouble walking etc. my mum on the other hand had it easy and family friends have always told me that she was always lucky. When it is really bad I’ll often take days off school because I can’t even get out of bed in the morning (I’ll also add that my teachers are very understanding since they have seen first hand how painful it is for me).

The problem arises with my mum. She doesn’t understand how bad I have it and thinks I exaggerate my pain.

Fast forward to now, and my parents planned a trip to Canberra (Australia’s capital) for the long weekend so we could go to the Floriade Flower Festival. I had been excited to go until I realised that I was going to be on my period during the trip. I told my mum in private that I would go but if I felt that it was too much I was going back to our hotel room and spending the rest of the day there, which I think was reasonable. Well, my mum didn’t think so and told me that it wasn’t going to happen because she didn’t want to ruin my dads time (he loves gardening and enjoys going to these festivals). This turned into a huge argument which ended with me screaming at my mum saying that it’s not my fault she doesn’t understand how easy she had it.

Everyone in my family is telling me I was an asshole to her and that she can’t help how her body works. I feel bad because she does try to sympathise with me but just can’t understand. I feel that I need an outside opinion because I genuinely felt I was in the right, but now I feel bad.

EDIT: ok so y’all have been really nice and told me to go to the doctor. Well I have and am currently in the process of seeing if I have ovarian polyps? Hope I get the answer, wish me luck 🤞

EDIT 2: so it’s been a while since I posted this but I’ve been to the doctors a lot and nothing has been found. I’ve been put on birth control and it’s definitely helped and made things a lot less painful, thank you to everyone for your advice 😊"
285,9y5x0i,"AITA - for not paying to upgrade a tv I accidentally broke I accidentally broke my partners six year old television and it is smashed. He has been talking about purchasing a new one anyway, but this has obviously brought that forward slightly because of my clumsiness and temper. I feel terrible about this and have offered to purchase a new one for him.

&#x200B;

He is demanding a brand new, up to date, 4k version of the one he currently owns. I am more than happy to replace this for him but he has had six years of constant use out of this. I feel offering to buy a new replacement is reasonable and would even go and collect it immediately. He paid £650 six years ago and the one he is demanding is around £649. I have found one that is the same brand, the same size for £499, but only has one USB instead of the three he tells me he needs. He refuses to accept this.

&#x200B;

Am I the asshole here?

&#x200B;

UPDATE - I ended up purchasing the tv he wanted in the end. He said it was the only one he wanted, it was my fault for breaking the television and causing him to go without, and if I didn't pay the money then he would just withhold the rent money he pays until it was paid for. An expensive lesson for me, but I take full responsibility and feel terrible about it, so at least it is resolved. Thank you for your responses."
286,dp0qgr,"AITA for demanding my husband replace my daughter's broken shoes the night before picture day? A little background:
My 7 year old daughter has two pairs of shoes (somewhere) she lost one of her tennis shoes about a week ago and hasn't found them, so she's been wearing her dress shoes to school everyday. She waits until an hour before bedtime to inform us that she has a hole in her dress shoes ... Both of them ... Big ones.

Knowing that she has perfectly good tennis shoes, I set her on yet another search for them. Without the other pair to rely on, she starts to panic, so I help her.

More background: I am severely affected by a nervous system disorder and actually had a somewhat functional day, so I went under couches, under beds, and through closets until I completely crashed.

By that time it was past the kids bedtime and I didn't know what else to do. I wasn't physically able to walk around anymore so I told my husband to go out to the store and get her a new pair of shoes. 

He makes it a point to take the ""natural consequences"" stance on losing her tennis shoe and being rough on her dress shoes, and duct tapes over the holes in the dress shoes. They are clearly not going to stay put while walking to school. I tell him that's not going to stay and looks ridiculous. He then says that if it's so important to me that I should go to the store myself. I should remind you that I'm not even able to walk around anymore, let alone drive and walk to the store and walk around there. If I was physically able, I'd have gone the minute it was clear that we weren't going to find that shoe tonight. 

Yes! She should have been more careful with her dress shoes.
Yes! She should be more mindful about where she puts her tennis shoes.
But this is a basic need that we need to provide our daughter.

 I'm really mad at my husband's refusal here and I'm worried about my daughter's feet as she walks to school. I'm worried about my daughter's social well-being and worried about a CPS call from an overrracting mandated reporter at school. AITA?"

At this point, it’s 10:30. He refuses to let me sleep in bed stating that I’ve kept him up. 

Hi The kicker for me is that he consistently is in bed by **10:45** to watch a show before falling asleep, which is later than I’ve ever been, and definitely keeps me awake.

288,e7u4o0,"AITA for being mad my family woke me up on my day off? I’m a 20f full-time sophomore in college, I live by myself and I usually get up around 5:30-6:00 so I have time to take care of my dogs, get ready, drive, find parking (which is a nightmare at my university) and get to class by 8:30. I don’t have money for WiFi at home so I usually stay on campus a few hours to get my hw that needs internet connection done, and I usually get home around 4-5, sometimes later if I go to tutoring. After that, I work on my house that’s under construction (currently living in a small travel trailer) or clean or do laundry, etc. By the time I go to bed around 9pm usually, I’m exhausted and wake up still tired every day because I struggle to stay asleep and wake up several times in the night regularly (my family is well aware of this and doesn’t seem to care).

I haven’t had any days truly off for months because almost every weekend, my grandparents come and help me on my house some, but this weekend they were on a short vacation with my aunt and her infant nieces out of state. They got back late last night and told me that they wouldn’t be working on the house since today (Sunday) was the twins’ bday, plus finals are coming up this next week and I’ve been incredibly stressed.

So I turned off my alarm, turned my phone ringer down, and tried to sleep in for once. It didn’t work. I was woken up at 7:30 by my phone buzzing incessantly, and when I finally answered, my grandparents were livid that I hadn’t gotten up yet and told me that 1 hour was way more than enough time to sleep in. I was cranky and probably had a bit of an attitude, but I feel like it was at least a little warranted, but I know I’ll be getting snide comments about it from the whole family for who knows how long because they all gossip to one another (which is the main reason I am not close with any of them). 

Am I in the wrong here for being pissed about getting woken up? I literally didn’t have anything I needed to do today besides study and maybe work on the house, but it’s too cold to do anything til about noon, and there’s no birthday party planned for the twins as they’re turning 2 and my family isn’t super big on birthdays. I was planning on sleeping til probably 9ish or whenever my body decided to wake up."
289,b34wkb,"AITA for not wanting extended family at my wedding? My partner and I recently decided that the idea of the big, expensive (75ish people, $30,000) wedding we had previously discussed did not feel right. We are now discussing having a much smaller wedding at a local outdoor attraction, which offers permits for weddings of 25 people or less. 

I ran the idea by my mom, and we began to discuss the guest list. When I told her I only wanted to invite immediate family (my parents, my single living grandparent, and my only sibling) she became really upset. She couldn’t understand why I would want to invite my friends, who may not be in my life forever, and said I should invite my extended family instead (mostly her brother, which would involve inviting six people total).

I have nothing against her brother, we just aren’t close and he doesn’t know my partner well. I would be surprised if he could name five things he knew about my relationship. 

I want my wedding to be only people who know one (preferably both) of us really well and are an important source of love and support in our lives and relationship. My uncle is not, and my friends are. She said the idea of him not being at my wedding is “breaking her heart.”

I know my mom is really close with her brother and he has helped her through a difficult last year. She was recently sick and he took time off work and flew down to take care of her on a pretty regular basis. 

However, I don’t feel like my wedding is where that needs to be recognized/appreciated. My wedding is an important step in my relationship with my partner, and it’s not about the rest of my family. I also don’t want my wedding to feel like a performance, and I’m worried that due to my low self esteem, having people I don’t know very well will make me feel like I’m putting on a show the whole time. I’m worried if I give in to my mom I will end up resenting her for stopping me from having my “dream wedding.”

So am I the asshole here? Should I skip inviting my friends to invite my extended family? Should I give up on the idea of having a small wedding and let my mom pay for a larger event? "

291,cewtzu,"AITA for filming my sister and yelling at her to prove my honesty? NOT NSFW.

I am a kid, so please keep this in mind with my decisions.

My younger sister and I have a history of having lots of disagreements that end in shouting. As a result, we both have lied about it in the past. But the past few years I have grown more mature, and do not lie about this sort of thing. She, on the other hand, still lies to get me into trouble. My mom always either dismisses the situation or gets us in trouble because ""she does not know who to believe.""

I am fed up. A few days ago my father was on a work call and my mom was gone so I was the supervisor of my younger sister and brother \[8M\]. Being the great babysitter brother I am, I give my sister the iPad, which she does not always get to use, so she can play Minecraft PE. As I am the one in charge, I can give/take from them whatever. Eventually my brother comes and asks for a turn as she is not letting him use it. It has been over an hour and I told him he could get it after 30 mins.  My brother says she pushed him down and hit him. My parents tell me I have full authority when I am in charge, for context.

I go into her room and ask her to give him the iPad many times. He walks over to her to try to get it from her, and she hits him. I decide this would be a good time to prove my honesty, so I pull out my phone and start filming. There is video evidence of her hitting, taking my phone and throwing it, and even throwing the iPad.

Eventually, she slams her door and my mom arrives. I have prepared, and have the videos in my hand to prove it. My brother walks to my mom as well.

As soon as we are about to calmly present this to my mom, my sister comes down screaming and crying and claiming all sorts of things like ""they aren't telling the truth"" and ""I didn't do anything"" and ""he told me I could!"" Even though we haven't said anything yet. My brother and I try to but in, but my mom shushes us, grabs my sister by the shoulder and takes her to their closet (where they can't disturb my father). This allows my sister to give my mother her bull version of the story before my brother and I can *show her the* ***evidence****.* 

Eventually, they get out  and my mom tells my brother and I to down, where my dad has finished. Now, I try to show them the evidence and my brother tries to explain as well, but we are shushed for ""disrespect."" My mom then says ""electronics are always the problem"" and proceeds to take my phone and the iPad, then says ""you will not be getting these back until the end of the summer"". I know in the end, it will only be about a month, but this is no punishment to my sister because she could care less about playing video games, just when she does she likes to do it for a while.

At this point, I am so fed up with it that I get up and call my sister ""a princess with entitled bull attitude"" doing my best to not curse in front of my family. My dad starts to walk over to pull me away so I run up. My sister is shaking and screaming.

292,cy12ke,"AITA for refusing to pay my dog sitter My husband is a teacher, there was an education conference in Vegas. His boss said my daughter and I were more than welcome to come and stay in the hotel/ hang out for the day. This would work out because we were traveling to California that weekend for my daughters first birthday party (that’s where all of our family is) and then we could just drive from Vegas instead of making 4 separate 6 hour drives. Then we realized that we could not afford a dog sitter for 6 days, and my daughter and I would just stay home and take the dog to CA with us. I was fine with this.  

My husbands coworker (who wasn’t attending the conference- she’s front desk) asked if my daughter and I were going to Vegas. My husband said no and told her why. That’s when she said “oh man I would love to watch your dog!! I’d do it for free!” My husband asked if she was sure and told her how many days it would be. she confirmed that she would love to, saying that when she was at work her boyfriend would help. This was great because our income is tight, we had been saving up to be able to afford the trip to California for my daughters first birthday so all of our family could come since I didn’t expect 30+ people to travel to Arizona for her birthday. We stayed with my in-laws. All we had to pay for was the gas and party supplies, and my mom covered like half of the party supplies.

We get back from our trip and are driving back from picking up our dog and I text her again to thank her. she replies back with a text saying “so we never discussed payment- how much were you thinking”  I was caught really off guard since she was the one who offered to do it for free to begin with. I texted back “oh I hadn’t thought about it since the initial  discussion you said you wouldn’t expect payment” she responded with “oh well I was thinking like $40” I thought that was fair enough and didn’t want to make a big stink of it so whatever, I’ll take it out of our grocery money, I’ll shop at the 99 cent store this week.   

We get home, and I’m getting our dogs crate set up, and the thing won’t unfold. I have to really finagle it. We’ve only had this crate like 6 weeks at this point it was in perfect condition when we dropped it off. I finally get it unfolded and idk what they did with it but the front panel was warped and bent so the bottom tray couldn’t come out and the door wouldn’t close properly. Like at all. This would have to be intentional because these crates are not easy to bend. I texted the coworker and asked if there had been any incident with the crate. She said “well I know boyfriend had trouble getting it folded up before you guys got there but other than that no” we then sent her pictures of the damage. I told her I wouldn’t be able to pay her because we had to buy a new crate-  crates are like $60.  

Am I the asshole for refusing to pay the dog sitter after a. She offered to do it for free and b. Wrecked the dog crate so it’s practically unusable

Update: she called me and apologized for the damage, said that she wouldn’t expect us to pay after that"
293,bzlchz,"AITA for refusing to help my mom anymore? So my mom is working on a project, and she asked for my help when she started. I was very happy to help at first.

She gave me a general idea of what she wanted and I helped her plan an outline, and then I helped her with the details, then the fine details, and before I knew it I had done over 80% of the work for her. I realized she'd basically gotten me to do everything for her, and I slowed down on the help I was providing. I requested she pick up where I left off on one of the parts. She initially said no problem and she'd get to it as soon as she had time. The project wasn't going to be in use for a few more weeks, so I went back to polishing some of the finer details on a piece I had started when she first asked for my help, and mostly completed but wasn't perfectly happy with.

It's been over a month and a half since she agreed to pick up the slack and she's done absolutely nothing she said she would. A couple weeks ago she requested we change the things I've already completed, and when I pointed out that was unnecessary, and if she'd only complete the thing she said she would, the whole project would essentially be done. She ignored me, and instead said that she'd just redo my work instead. I got upset and walked away for a while. I came back today to see what progress she had made, and she had neither altered my previous work, nor completed the thing I requested she do. She again requested I redo my work, or show her how to do it herself. I'm frustrated at this point so I just try to show her what I'd already done (which would also explain how to do it) and she wouldn't listen to my instruction because ""well there must be a different way, that's too convoluted"". Then she asked me to do the part I'd stepped back to let her do. I carefully explained that basically throwing all my hard work away and refusing to do her part had really hurt my feelings, because it was her project and I felt like I had done all the work for her. She told me ""well this way will make ME feel better"" which I take to mean my feelings don't matter.

I don't want to help her anymore, and I don't want to even help her learn how to redo my work. Other people are waiting on her to finish this project, and nothing can progress until the part I asked her to do is done. Her ""due date"" to finish this project was about four weeks ago. I know she's got other things going on in her life besides working on this project, but I also know she isn't so busy that she doesn't have any time to do it. I feel like her request to redo my work is just the latest way for her to procrastinate doing the part I requested she do, but before that I was willing to just patiently wait her out. Now I want to walk away entirely. Am I an asshole for not helping anymore? Am I an asshole for being a bit upset that I've done most of her work for her? I know I volunteered myself, but it feels like she's been ungrateful for my work and my help.

I work at a grocery store and happen to be the one employee that closes 5/7 days of the week. 3 weeks ago, I put in a time-off request to take off Saturday, Sunday. My uncle was coming into town, and we (my dad, uncle, and I) were all going to attend the Great American Beer Festival. We paid $85 each to get a ticket. 


On top of putting the request online, I also talked to the store manager, who was in charge of making my department's schedules until we got a new manager. I told her I really need these two days off, and she said something along the lines of, ""lucky for you we allow time-off! Just put it in online, and I'll take care of it."" Again, this was three weeks prior to the dates. 


A week before those days, I see they post the schedules, and lo and behold, I was scheduled on the two days I requested off. I went to tell the store manager, who said, ""I'm busy right now, I'll check it out tomorrow."" When I came into work the next day, I realized that she wasn't even schedules to come in that day. Basically she just lied to shoo me away.

To preface this, this girl seems to be super into me. She gives me a lot of interest signs such as always touching my arm, laughing at everything I say, copying my traits, inviting me back to her place alone and always finding a chance to get close to me. 

Initially she said she wasn’t interested so I simply said “if you change your mind let me know” and left it at that. This morning I got a text saying “hey ___, what time was the movie?” So I set a time and place to meet before the movie, I got there and she was 10 minutes late which was slightly annoying but anyway, we managed to make it to the ticket booth with minutes to spare for our session.

Everything was good for that moment, we were talking and laughing. But as we got closer to the cashier, she started to say that she really wanted to see Aladdin. I said that we can watch it another time but for tonight I’m wanting to watch D.P like we planned. 

When we got to the man, she said she didn’t want to watch DP anymore so I just ordered a ticket for myself and then told her to go home. I ended up watching the movie and it was great! She sent a text telling me to enjoy and I thanked her after the movie was finished. AITA?"

By the way, I'm 19 years old and currently doing my apprenticeship in a office.

About 2 weeks ago my uncle contacted me to meet him at a notary near Berlin (That's 600km away), since he doesn't feel so good at the moment he wanted to make sure he gives me a big portion of his property and money after he passes away. ( He's an alcoholic, smoker and already experienced 2 strokes to this point)

I decided to take time off work as ""vacation"" for just a single day (monday). On sunday I drove to my uncle and signed everything we needed. We went to his place and talked for a few hours, I was just about to leave his place as he started slurring his words real bad and eventually became a fucking third stroke right infront of me. I didn't know what to do the first few seconds, untill I decided to call the ambulance. 15 minutes passes and they got him into the hospital. I drove to my grandma which was the first time I actually met her, because she's oldschool German and hates foreign people (I'm 1/2 Hungarian and 1/2 German) I told her everything that happened and after we visited my uncle in the hospital she allowed me to stay for a bit of time (a whole week) at her house.

I simply agreed and stayed there the whole week, I wanted to be with my uncle and be there for him if he needs anything.

On tuesday, the day after, I woke up at 6am (work starts at 7am) and wrote an E-Mail to my co-workers and my boss explaing that I can't get back in time since I have to deal with ""family issues"" and that I have to expand my ""vacation"" for another 4 days and I will sign that aswell but after I come back  (I didn't tell them anything specific since it's non of their business)

The same day at 5pm I got an E-Mail from one of my co-workers telling me that this is unacceptable and there will be consequences for what I did.

After my uncle wasn't in life threatening danger anymore I said goodbye to both of them on saturday and drove back towards bavaria next to austrias border.

Monday (today) I got to work and was greeted with a big fuck you and a warning for expanding my vacation without consent of my boss. I told him I couldn't drive 600km to work to sign that damn piece of paper and drive back up there for another 600km. He was like ""well you should have""

AITA for putting my family first instead of a dogshit company that pays me 4€/hour?!

297,cmtwv3,"AITA for rescinding my homophobic grandparents invite to my wedding? Let me start this off by saying I am all for everyone having they’re own beliefs, but not at the harm of myself or the family I am starting. 

Today, (you can go to my post history to see this screenshot) my fiancé sent my homophobic grandmother a message on Facebook (I do not use Facebook, so it had to come from her) stating that while we understand they got a save the date (to which their response was “we will think about it”) they’re uninvited and should not be expecting an invitation.

Therapy taught me that I cannot please everyone, and this is a result of it. I will not put myself or my fiancé into a position that could cause some pretty harsh emotional damage. 

They have treated my fiancé like she’s less than human the few times they’ve seen each other in person. 

I’m asking if AITA because we’ve gotten responses saying “this should have been a phone call” or “they’ll learn, they should still be invited” but they’ve had 5.5 years to learn.

298,d4rtvi,"AITA for not telling my parents about my potentially serious health problems? I am 23 and live with them at home. For a while now, I have been riddled with health problems. Urinary/bladder problems, muscle twitches, migraines, a weird foot infection, stomach issues, muscle problems... I just have a plethora of health problems which plague me, it almost seems like I am juggling 3-4 of them at a time. It seems like right when I am done dealing with one health issue, another one pops up. I cant think of a time when I wasn't dealing with a health issue. I have been to doctors, gotten tests done etc, most of the time they cant even find anything wrong for a lot of the stuff. I am getting a test done tomorrow, an MRI, to see if I have MS, which I have been suspicious about for a while now, but I had a brain MRI done a bit ago which showed nothing so chances are its not that. 

&#x200B;

Regardless, I haven't told my parents about the vast majority of these problems. I will sometimes stay inside for days at a time because of how difficult, both physically and mentally, this stuff is. My parents have obviously noticed this over the years, but I just have an incredibly difficult time telling them about my problems at all. Historically when I do tell them about health problems they think I am overreacting, or worse, they sort of make fun of me for it and act like I am a hypochondriac. Its funny, considering for a while I was basically the opposite of a hypochondriac, downplaying pretty serious symptoms as 'normal' and not going to doctors for months, but I can't really do that anymore. I've had to drop out of school and I barely even work anymore now because of this stuff, and my parents sort of just chop it up to me being lazy and unmotivated. 

&#x200B;

I use their health insurance. I live in their house. But I still feel the need to literally sneak way to the doctor and lie about where I am going because I don't want to deal with them either 1. making fun of me, or 2. worrying about me. I know those sound like opposites kind of, but I just cant stand the idea of them knowing this stuff. One time they did find out about an issue (when I had my migraines at my worst) they became unbearably bad about it. I regretted telling them so much because of how they sort of twisted it to make it seem as if I was a complainer and that I need to stop worrying about it. 

&#x200B;

Am I the asshole for not telling my own parents about this stuff, while I am living in their home? My cousin, who is basically my best friend, is constantly telling me I should tell them when these things happen to me. But he has normal parents. He doesn't really get how awful my parents can get in that regard. Is it inherently immoral for a son to keep such big health issues from their parents, while they are partially living on their parents dime?"
299,e5o63z,"AITA for giving a homemade gift for secret santa? So my place of work had a secret santa thing for the holidays. The spending limit was $25 which, in my opinion, usually ends up with people getting each other junky shit that they don't end up using. I drew a name and got someone whom I know fairly well and consider myself acquaintances with. I am a hobby jewelry maker, and I go beach combing often to find shells and sharks teeth to incorporate in jewelry that I wear or that I gift to friends/family. I am new at it, so I have never sold any of my stuff, but I often get complemented on my jewelry so I guess I'm not too terrible at it. I do it mostly because I enjoy crafting. 

The girl I got for the secret santa wears similar beachy inspired jewelry as I do, so I thought it would be nice if I made her a bright orange keyhole limpet shell (that I found) bezel set ring. It takes a bit of time to make these but as I said I enjoy doing it, especially when I'm gifting it to other people. So I gave her the ring and she said she loved it and all was well. Now I come to find out that she is talking shit about it, saying how I cheaped out and didn't even buy her anything, how I just went to the beach and looked for a shell and used the equipment I already had and a tiny bit of my wiring/sterling silver to make her a piece of jewelry she could buy for $5. For the record, I have seen Etsy shops that sell nearly identical products with the same quality metal for like $60+. 

Anyways, AITA for this? I know I didn't have to spend upfront money on her ring since I had the equipment and live close to the beach, but I did put time into it and I would never gift something I made that I wouldn't wear myself. It wouldn't have offended me if she said it wasn't her style, I'd totally understand. I guess I'm just butthurt I'm being called cheap. If I knew this would happen I would've found some $25 gift to buy her and save myself the trouble."
300,d5n2pa,"AITA For being upset at my girlfriend due to her financial decisions? My gf (20F) and I (20M) have been together for almost 2 years. In that time I have spent thousands on plane tickets to see her since we did not live in the same state for an entire year. I have paid for her tickets to me, and my tickets to her. Which I am perfectly okay with because I love her and want to be around her.

I have also paid for her mistakes. She ruined a $400 couch once after a drunk night out, I covered that cost since I had the money and she didn’t, this was during the year we were apart and I was working a steady job and she was in university, with no job. I never asked for the money back.

During our visits throughout that year I also financially provided for almost all of her meals while I was in town because she couldn’t afford to eat out. I was fine with all of this.

This year we are at the same university, and see each other on a regular basis. She received a full scholarship and grant this year, so she is extremely financially stable, she actually gets paid to go to university. She has spent thousands on a new macbook, a huge tv, a surround sound system, etc. All things she wanted for herself. She had a laptop, tv and speakers, these new purchases were “upgrades.”

Last week we went out to grab burgers and I was short $3, so she paid for me and immediately ask for her money when we got home. I also broke my leg recently, and spent some time at her place overnight, in that time I finished a container of her ibuprofen, and she expected me to replace the $2 container.

I never spent money on her expecting to be given anything but appreciation in return. Now the roles are flipped. I cannot work because of my broken leg, and she has plenty of extra money because of her scholarship. I dont expect her to shower me with gifts, but it would be nice for her to maybe cover my $3 dollar burger, or instead of spending thousands on luxuries for herself, help me when I’m hurting, like I helped her when she couldn’t fly to me.

301,cbar29,"AITA For reporting my neighbor’s dog to my HOA for not shutting up? I live in a condo complex that prides itself in being a safe, quiet, and well-kept place. It’s not new by any means and in no way remotely luxurious; but it’s very peaceful. As a result, there’s a strict “no dogs allowed” policy.

The complex is set up in a way where there are several buildings and each building hosts 4-6 condo units. You cannot enter a building if you do not live in one of the units.

In the building next to me, one of the units owns a dog. I’ve known this for a while (I’ve seen it in the window a couple of time) but I’ve never actually seen it leave the house. It never bothered me personally and I’m not one to be the nosy neighbor with a notepad writing down every minor infraction I see committed.

But holy hell, these past couple of weeks for whatever reason, they’ve really let the dog bark. Every night at around 9PM they open their window and just let it... bark... at nothing. It’s loud, it’s shrill, and it goes on for HOURS. I work early in the morning and this has been keeping me awake.

My first thought was to confront the neighbor, but I cannot directly contact them since I don’t have access to the building. I do not know this person’s schedule and frankly, I have no clue who even lives in this particular unit.

My next thought was to try and somehow keep an eye on who enters and leaves the building and see if i can stop someone and ask who the owner is, but Im really only home at night when no one is coming or going.

Last night when the barking started up again, I got out of bed, frustrated, and logged into the HOA website to submit an complaint.

Today I got a response back saying that the neighbor will be confronted and will be told to remove the dog from the property as it violates the bylaws. They have an undisclosed amount of time to comply or there will supposedly be legal action taken.

I don’t know what i was expecting honestly, but now I feel bad. I don’t want anyone to be separated from their pet but good god I don’t think it would be that hard to quiet your dog at *least* during the time of day when everyone is trying to sleep. I mean, they open the friggin window for it each night as if they’re encouraging it.

Part of me feels shitty thinking this person will possibly have to get rid of their pet, but part of me wants to enjoy the quiet nights again and feels that if you’re going to be this irresponsible about sneaking a pet in, you deserve the repercussions. 

And yeah, it’s barking at 10:30PM as I type this."
302,b0vgee,"AITA for reporting my best friends mom for wage violations? Sorry for poor formatting as I am on mobile.

Best Friend’s Mom = BFM

First off, I would like to say that there was no personal motivation behind why I did it. As some back story, my best friends mom owned a cafe. They were struggling with finding employees so I agreed to come in and train for free (important later on). After about a week of training, I started working as a solo employee opening up the place (also important). After working around 3 shifts, we had a disagreement and I was fired. Not upset about it. The next day, they close the place down for financial reasons.

Here’s where the wage violations come in. A few days after the scheduled payday, I checked my bank account and there was no paycheck. I sat on it for a week before deciding to text her asking why I hadn’t gotten paid. Long story short, BFM deflects on the reasoning, gets very mad and proceeds to call me “a piece of work.” 

I really needed the paycheck. Later I posted on a certain law-related subreddit asking what to do. They suggested filing a claim with the Department of Labor. Doing what any sensible teenager does, I check with my friends. They say go for it, so I do. 

Today I got a call from the department. We talked and it was mentioned that I, being a minor, wasn’t allowed to work as early as I had. My agent said it might be helpful to get in touch with BFM to let her know, essentially saying pay me or pay fines.

Well I did and it blew up in my face.

My best friend calls me screaming saying we’re through and how I shouldn’t have attacked her family like this. Now all of my friends are saying I’m an asshole for reporting her over a few hundred bucks.

Was I the asshole?"
303,chiuvf,"AITA for threatening to collect child support because my son's father won't communicate with me? My son's father and I had an acrimonious split. I was, and am, the primary caregiver. I did not file for child support because my ex insisted he would pay for anything the baby needed, and I felt bad for him being unemployed at the time. At first, he was just coming to see the baby whenever he felt like it, and I got fed up. Especially because any time I said, ""I'm sorry, you can't take the baby right now, we have other plans,"" he would accuse me of trying to kidnap his son.

I insisted that, if he didn't want to go to court for custody, he had to agree to a parenting plan with me. No more showing up whenever he feels like. That was a battle itself, but eventually we agreed that he would have the baby each week from noon on Wednesday until 6:30 PM Thursday. Fine, Great. Done. Or so I thought.

He initially stuck to the schedule, but soon I was getting calls Wednesday morning, ""Hey, can I just pick up baby after his nap?"" Or, ""Something came up, I'll be there at six."" I gave him leeway because he works in construction (when he's working) and he was giving me a heads up.

The past couple of weeks, he has just shown up unannounced, today while I was getting my son ready for his nap, last week at some random time in the afternoon. I told him today that this behavior was not OK with me, and I needed him to communicate with me before picking up our son.

He said, ""I have no way to communicate with you."" The reason for this is that he blocked my number, which I am fine with, because out texting situation has been toxic, BUT he absolutely can reach me on my home phone, which he has done in the past. It was a ridiculous excuse, and then he blamed ME for his ""inability"" to contact me. I got upset with his lies and his manipulation and told him, ""If you refuse to communicate with me about our son, expect to get served with a child support order.""

Then I became the bad person who reneged on my ""promise"" not to make him pay child support. I was trying to manipulate him, he said, because he had left me for another woman. He says it is revenge, I say it is money that my child and I are owed, I was nice not to make him pay in the first place, and I have every right to except communication about our child (plus, if he we can't contact each other, what about an emergency?)"
304,a54w1g,"AITA - Personal hygiene AITA for constantly making sure my SO puts on antiperspirant in the morning?? I try to do it nicely, sometimes it may come across as mean if I get home and he's ponging. I'll literally point out to him that he smells really bad.
Almost every day I'm reminding him to put it on, and when he does he doesn't even spray it under his arms where it needs to go, but over his clothes. It's beyond frustrating as his b.o can be quite... Strong. There have been moments where I can't even snuggle up to him because the smell of sweat is quite ... Overwhelming. 

I also have told him that it's not nice for who he works with if he ends up sweating like crazy. That and he has a habit of wearing his shirt a few days in a row. (Because apparently sweat can't go through two layers of clothing....?) He works in an office, within a team that deals with customers  face to face every other week. I just don't get how someone doesn't mind the fact that they end up smelling of b.o??? 


(He doesn't have any allergies btw. And it's the only personal hygiene he seems to miss, he brushed his teeth every day and every night so he doesn't get gammy breath.)

She is narcissistic and toxic. It's always about her. She takes any situation and makes it about her.   I moved out when I was 16 and I've done well for myself ever since.  I have an older sister who is bi-polar and worse than my mother (havent spoken in 5 years)  My little sister tolerates Mom because she is the only parent we have left. Dad passed 1.5 years ago. Little sister and I get along pretty well. I'm close with her kids.

My mom is a leech. Always trying to play on peoples emotions and anything she can get for free, she does. Uses guilt, blackmail, what I call ""Fake nice"" to get what she wants. In other words, if you dont believe the way she does or act the way she wants you to, you are wrong. She takes and takes and takes...and its exhausting. To the outside world she is a good Christian lady, former nurse and all around nice person. This is the furthest from the truth.

Since Dad passed I dont have a reason to ""make nice"". The last straw is when she called me and said, ""I took care of your Dad for years, I dont want his cat. Come get it or I'm taking it to the pound. Today"" I told her I needed time to fined a home. (I cant have her-my cat HATES other cats) Thank goodness my friend from out of state was visiting and was able to take my Dad's Cat.

307,atvjvo,"AITA for refusing to make my kid apologize? AITA So my mom has always been some what (okay a lot) of an authoritarian style parent.  There were a lot of time growing up where I didn't agree with her about something but was not allowed to voice that. And honestly even now, there are some of those times.

I love my mom, she's the strongest person I ever met.  But because of this I have never shared much of my personal life with her.  I try to open up more now, because I want an open relationship with her.  And, to her credit she has tried a lot harder to be less strict but she's still her own way.

Well because of this I have made it a point to involve my son in our lives as much as makes since given his age etc.  he has always been given a voice.

Okay so let's get the background over... I'm a single mother to a 5 year old boy with several allergies. Some severe and some mild.  Including an array of food allergies. My mother babysits him while I am at work.  This generally means she is feeding him about one meal a week by my request, and sometimes he gets junk or treats there too.

Well recently my mom was feeding him and the other kids (cousins) some dinner which happened to be cooked with an ingredient my son is allergic to.  It's complicated to explain the nature of that particular allergy but while he will likely not die from it, he is still usually caused a bit of discomfort when he eats it.  Hives, itchy mouth, etc.  Typically if it is cooked and he gets some, it's okay. But he has reacted to cooked too. So even though his epipen isn't for that specific food, we avoid it.  Basically he *can* eat it and not die but really shouldn't and he and I have decided together he won't. 

Well mom told him he had to eat his dinner or he was going to be in big trouble.  When he said no again she told him he was grounded from
Screens all night until he cleaned his plate.  My son's reply was ""Fine. I don't care how much trouble I'm in I am NOT eating that.  You can't make me.""

Well of course my mom was livid when I got there to get him.  And she had told me he has to apologize before he can come back.

I told her that I can't make him do that. I have taught him from day 1 that he can refuse to eat any food he's allergic to. No adult can make him poison himself. And I will 100% back that up.  

Now mom is saying we are both AH's and need to apologize to her.  That she knows which foods he is deathly allergic to and which ones are ""fine as long as he has antihistamines if he gets hives."" 

So, AITA? And was my son holey-jr?

308,eu7sjv,"AITA for not calling my step-mother? Hello,

I am typically a lurker on here, but recent events around Christmas have me questioning if I'm an asshole.

There is a lot of info. So, I apologize for the lengthy post and I also apologize for being on mobile. I'll put a tl;dr at the bottom.

For a bit of background, in 2019 I moved to Japan to further my career and be with my SO who is Japanese (we met in the states when he studied at my UNI).

Since moving, I have called my main family members and other family members I am close to at least once  every couple of months. I call my mother, my grandmother, my step-dad, brother and sister from my mom's marriage, a few cousins (step mothers side), and my uncle (step mothers side) at least once a week. Everyone else falls into the once a month or less category for the exception of my step mother.

I have not spoken to my step-mother once. I have no interest in speaking to her and she doesn't really seem to care as she has made no effort to contact me.

She spread horrible lies about my mother in order to convince me to move in with her and father so they no longer had to pay child support. She got worse with her treatment upon moving in. I was miserable and had horrible anxiety and depression. Any contact leaves me an emotional wreck as she is so awful to me. She also manipulates my father into thinking I was leeching off of him and I was the reason he had financial issues. She also has him convinced that she treats me better than my own mother.

Anyway, at Christmas she and my father complained to everyone except for me that I didn't call my father enough and I never once called her. After they left the Christmas party (I refused to go to their home), my family members harassed me and questioned how I could be so ungrateful and unloving to the people who raised me? They didn't. My mom and my daddy (wonderful step father who raised me as his own.) Raised me.  

Since then, my grandmother brings it up everytime I speak to her. I don't want to call my step mother, but she says I am obligated to forgive my step mother because she is ""my mother"".

My question is, am I the asshole for not calling her? I get that she is my father's wife, but she never behaved as a mother. She gaslight me, verbally abuses me, and when I was younger even physically abused me. I've told this to my father and he accused me of lying. The rest of my father's family keep using the ""but she is family. You have to forgive family"" line. 

Tl;dr:
I'm being harassed by my father's family for not calling my step mother who was emotionally abusive my entire life. Family says I have to forgive her and build a relationship with her because she is family.
Am I the asshole for refusing?"
309,dj8ole,"AITA For getting a tattoo with what I thought was the designers blessing I have a tattooer friend. She's not very experienced.
It started when I decided to contact her again after a while to see what's up with her, and we got to the conclusion that I wanted a tattoo. She spent some time on a design I thought was really cool and she did too. After talking with my parents, they decided they would want me to do it in a studio and not with someone like that. Understandably I agreed, and apologized to my friend and offered to pay for the design as much as she charges, for the time and effort put into it. She said it's okay and also that I can tell my mom that i went to a studio with her design but do it with her. Or st least that's what she meant. You see, in Hebrew, the same exact sentence is exactly the same as telling my mother to go to a studio with her design and having me do it there. Since the only difference is one word, spelled and said the same, there was no way for me to distinguish, and at the time it didn't occur to me there would be anything to distinguish in the first place. So that's what I did, except the studio didn't like taking designs so they made their own based on her's. She can back to me absolutely furious. She said I stole her design and that I'm complete human garbage, saying the business is hard anyway and that she geniuenely hopes I die in a fire. I understand why she's mad, but I feel like she's completely over reacting!! I've shown the sentence to some of my friends and they construed it in the same way I did. Am I being an asshole for thinking I don't deserve that kind of behavior from her?

INFO UPDATE: i could not end up paying as she didn't give me the address by the time I did the tattoo, and after it she said she doesn't want my money. I don't see what's the difference if I paid a day before the tattoo or a day after, but either way she made it clear that's not why she's mad.

After the fight I offered to still pay because she deserves the money regardless of our relationship which is when she said that the money won't fix anything.

SECOND UPDATE: fixed the wording so it doesn't seem like I knew the wording was ambiguous and used it."
310,elvqnj,"WIBTA if I say No to boss trying to limit my only benefit? I work at a small company that doesn't provide me any traditional benefits: no insurance of any kind, no 401k, no vacation, no sick leave, no paid holidays, nothing. When I started, this was all spelled out clearly, and I'm in a position where it wasn't a problem. The only 'benefit' I get is the ability to take (unpaid) time off whenever I want, make my own hours, and work from home a few days a week. At first, I had a limited role, worked 25 hours per week, and it was no issue to be as flexible as possible. My boss made it perfectly clear that she didn't care when I worked, as long as I got things done.

Since I've started, we've grown. From the full staff being just myself and the president, we now also have a part time assistant, and an intern. My responsibilities have grown, and I'm now in the office 4 days a week, and WFH one. I'm working more like 35 hours, and obviously cannot be quite as flexible as I was before. I get my work done, and have grinned and borne it as the president keeps giving me work I don't want that takes me away from my main responsibilities. To note, I still have no benefits.

Recently, I made an appointment, and put it on the calendar about 3 weeks in advance. I specified that I'd be WFH that morning and afternoon to accommodate. My intern was not scheduled to be in that day. This has been pretty standard, and I didn't think anything of it. However, the president just tried to have a talk with me saying that now I should make any appointments or personal things that would pull me away from work on my WFH day, and need her permission to take any time on days I am scheduled to be in the office. I waffled, but I'm honestly a bit upset. 

It frustrates me that after dumping work on me that she knows I don't want, and telling me I'm only getting a cost of living raise this year despite more and more responsibility that the president is now also trying to limit my only benefit. She's also not bothering to try to provide any sort of alternative compensation or benefit. 

WIBTA to tell her no? That while I always do my best to provide notice, and talk through conflicts, I'm not going to give up the only benefit I get from this role? Short of one emergency, I've never taken time off without ample notice, I am mindful of my responsibilities, and don't abuse the flexibility. We've had the additional staff since last spring, so I don't know why my taking any time has suddenly become problematic to her.

TLDR; boss suddenly wants me to ask for permission to take time off, when flexibility and ability to take unpaid time at will was the only benefit of my job. I don't want to ask permission. AITA?"

I live across the road from a mall parking lot, and a couple times a week there are a couple cars and trucks that go into the parking lot and do donuts for a few hours each night. It's loud and disturbing to my sleep, and in my opinion it's also dangerous because this parking lot is directly connected to a public road and not separated by any sorts of sidewalks or buffers.

A week or two ago I called the non-emergency number on them and I was forwarded to the dispatch number, which I felt bad about (I didn't think it was a serious enough issue to call the dispatch), and when I looked 30 minutes later they were gone. But today they're back, loud as ever, and all the roads are iced over right now which I think makes it even more dangerous (they could slip out of control and crash into a passing car). However, I don't want to be seen as a snitch or a killjoy, and I suppose the odds of somebody getting hit are relatively low. What say you?"
312,cwdo9s,"AITA for not wanting to make a 3 hour trip to save someone 15 minutes. My brother (lets call him MB) just moved into his new home. My family and I have been helping MB move into the home over the last month and there are just two more trips of belongings that need to be made in order to finish the move. He is busy for the week and one of these trips is time sensitive, a storage unit, meanwhile the other trip can wait. My other brother (OB) and I have offered to move the storage unit belongings while MB is out, overall this is a 3 hour trip minimum.

Now OB wants us to make the second trip as well (another 3 hours minimum) as an act of kindness towards MB. This trip consists of nothing but a wheelbarrow and an ATV.

On a normal week, MB passes by where he used to live daily (where the belongings are) and even stops by for around half an hour every time before going to his new house. Because of this I think it would be best if OB and I just load up everything for MB one day when he stops by as he is already on his way to his house, and MB just spend 15 minutes unloading, rather than OB and I spend 3 hours round trip to do the same task. I’m willing to help MB but I just find this trip to be inefficient.


TL;DR AITA for not wanting to make a 3 hour trip out of kindness, when my brother already makes this trip daily and it would just add 15 minutes.


To clarify, I don’t believe MB to be involved here as the decision to make this trip was an idea by OB out of kindness. I just personally find the trip to be a bit excessive."

The thing is, when I asked her to stop she was really upset. She said that ‘it’s how she shows affection’ and ‘she doesn’t see why I wouldn’t like it.’ She seemed hurt by it

So I wanted to ask if I was being unreasonable when I asked this?"
314,a5zs9b,"AITA for verbally retaliating against my girlfriend's friend? I recently came out of a pretty serious depression during which time I put on weight. I'm in the gym and making good progress to get back to where I was but am still noticeably larger than I was. During this time I wasn't as social and as a result it's been awhile since I had been out on group activities that included members of my girlfriend's social circle.

She has a particular friend who is known for ""blunt humor"" as they like to put it, basically the ballbuster of the group. I always found it to be a convenient excuse for her to be rude and give her unfiltered opinion under the guise of ""just joking"", but never made much of it. The other day I went to a little get-together with my girlfriend and a lot of her friends were also present, including miss ""i'm just joking."" Things were going well and most people were perfectly polite and happy to see me, hugs and that sort of thing. We bumped into ""I'm just joking"" and literally the first thing she did was a very exaggerated look up and down as if sizing me up then goes ""holy shit, you got fat!"" then touches my arm and laughs. 

Again, I've never been close to this woman and I've never really taken part in her style of humor so I found this inappropriate but I figured what the hell, let's see if she can take it as well as she dishes it so I said ""Thanks! I seen how well you pulled off the husky look and figured if you can do it so can I!"" Immediately she tensed up and asked me to repeat what I said, at which point my girlfriend touched her arm the same way she did to me and said ""I'm sure he was just joking"" to mimic her. She told us to go fuck ourselves and left five minutes later and has been blowing up my girlfriend's phone calling me a piece of shit since.

No one at the party said anything and we had a good time, but now word has gotten out and some of her friends feel I was out of line, others think it was hilarious and she deserved it. My girlfriend is fully on my side. In my mind, if she didn't appreciate someone commenting on her weight, why would she do it to someone else? Nevertheless, I'm here asking, AITA?"
315,aes8hr,"AITA for my actions in this friendship and to the end of it? This may get kind of long, but here it goes.

I met this woman about 10 years ago and we became friends and whatnot. We both went down separate paths but then came back around a few years ago and began getting close again. We had our ups and downs before and continued to have them when we recently met up again.

We worked together but not at the same location. I would come to visit for various reasons and she and I would hang out at those times. We weren't too far from each other so we would regularly meet up for lunch and also hang out after work.

She meets this guy at work and she first starts complaining about him and how he's harassing her, trying to get at her and is persistent even though she supposedly doesn't feel the same way.

Eventually they end up dating one another but constantly have problems where they break up every so often. I knew the guy and he and I had talked, never had a problem with one another and he never seemed to have a problem with her and I hanging out, probably knowing I wasn't a threat and knowing that I was madly obsessed with another woman that wasn't his girlfriend. However, my friend, the woman, did have a problem with us (she and I) hanging out. She said she felt like it was inappropriate for us to hang out and talk and whatnot.

At first, she said it was because he and I didn't know each other very well and she felt like it could give the impression to him and other people that she's cheating on him with me. So I ended up hanging out with him and talking to him more and the three of us began hanging out and going places.  Then it became a thing where she said she didn't want any male friends while she was dating someone.

I was pretty upset about this. I was there for her for a lot of stuff like when she called me talking about wanting to commit suicide and I was there late at night when she and he had fought with each other and had broken up...multiple times...I felt really upset that I was being put to the side because of what's between my legs. She knew full well that I was obsessed with another woman. I never tried anything with her. She and I did like each other many years before all this, but nothing ever came of it and we hadn't talked about it since then. The way she talked about this felt kind of sexist as well, like me being a man, I can't possibly keep it in my pants and I'd try something with her. Either that or as a man I'm too weak to hold her back and I'd let her basically rape me one day. Either way I put it just made me feel very offended with the way she was handling this.

I'd be lying if I said she wasn't there for me as well, because she was and I really did appreciate that about her. That was part of the reason why I was so upset. I really relied on her friendship for a lot of reasons and really valued her as a person. I felt she had her faults but that she had a great, positive influence on me.

Even though I disagreed, I told her that I felt her decision to limit time with me (hanging out, talking over the phone/texting) was stupid (I did use that word) but I would respect her wish, no matter how I felt about it.

We limited our time with one another, only hanging out and talking seldom. Most we'd say was a greeting and ""how are you?"" and then keep moving with our day.

But then she'd break up with her boyfriend numerous times during this time and who would she turn to for a shoulder to cry on? Me.

To me, it felt like I was a light switch. When life gets dark, I'll just flip on that convenient BestCaptain switch and let him brighten my life! And then I'll shut him off when everything goes back to being peachy.

I grew tired of this. I felt like either be hot or cold, but quit being one or the other *when* **you** *feel like it*.

Eventually, it just grew on me and I stopped talking to her altogether. I stopped hanging out with her. I was civil, especially since we worked together, but I wasn't being the overly friendly person I used to be. I still would say hi or good morning if I saw her, but that was it. Until one day when she saw me and gave me this weird look and then just ignored my ""good morning"", which she usually didn't do. From there on out, I stopped all the talking with her. Any interaction we had was strictly for work purposes. She seemed to want me to come around and I think she'd make up jobs for me to do to come around and then she'd try to get me to talk, but I maintained this bland demeanor of answering questions with a period to end the conversation where it was. I stopped going out of my way to see her like I had been doing, I stopped saying hi to her if I did see her unless she was with other people, and I only replied to texts/phone calls if it was work related and during work hours (she never did text/call after work, as far as I remember, but I would have ignored if she did).

She ended up getting a job somewhere else as did her boyfriend and I never heard from either since then, which was about 3 months ago. I still think about her and honestly wish her the best, but I often wonder if I was the asshole here with the end of it all. Or maybe an asshole sometime before this.

What do you think?"
316,d5vkn5,"AITA for being mad at a ""gift"" my boyfriend bought me? I'm a natural blonde, but I dye my hair dark colours, usually somewhere between medium brown and black, because I'm not very smart. I'd say that I'm of average intelligence but because I'm blonde me taking a minute to do some maths or asking stupid questions is amplified from a little gap in my knowledge or mental buffering to just me being seen as a total bimbo. I've told my boyfriend about this, and we have this conversation every time I dye my hair. I find that dark hair means people are more likely to forgive any dumb questions/comments I make and I'm just generally taken more seriously.

I went to my boyfriend's place last night and the first thing he does is pull out this little cube of wrapping paper, about the size of my palm. I asked what it was and he only said ""saw this and thought of you"", which I thought was really sweet but I wasn't expecting it as there was no occasion. I opened the paper and the gift was a tin of mints. The tin said ""*Caution: Blonde Moment in Progress*"". He was laughing, so I put the tin down and left without a word. By the time he realised I wasn't kidding and came out to follow me I was already in the lift, and he's called me about 20 times between me leaving his place last night and now, and sent a bunch of texts saying he thought it would be funny, that we could laugh it off, and if he'd known I'd react like that he wouldn't have done it.

He called my roommate asking if I got home alright, and he sent me flowers as an apology but hasn't actually said the phrase ""I'm sorry"", even over text. I'm a combination of upset and angry and I really don't want to talk to him right now. My roommate says he's now calling her repeatedly and is begging her to put me on the phone, but I'm not speaking to him. I feel completely justified but my roommate is asking me to just answer the phone, even if it's to tell him I'm not talking to him, just to shut him up, but I refuse. AITA?"

318,cam5in,"AITA for not looking after my neighbor's children? 
My neighbor is a single woman with two boys, twins aged eight. I don’t know the mother well but I often see the boys, as they play outside in their front lawn pretty often and I’m always working on my yard. They’re cute, sweet, charming kids and I enjoy talking to them from time to time.

Anyway, a few days ago they’re playing outside as usual and the mother comes out and asks me if I can keep watch to make sure they’re ok while she works on something in her basement. I say okay. They are doing normal kid stuff and I’m trimming some bushes, when I hear them arguing. At first I assume it’s a play fight. They are tousling around a bit, and then suddenly one of them slaps the other super hard across the face. The kid falls to the ground, holds his cheek, and starts sniffling. I quickly go over and ask them to calm down,  if they’re ok, what’s going on. The kid who slapped the other starts frantically apologizing, and then both of them tell me that they’re ok and ask me not to tell their mom. I chalk it up to boys roughhousing and tell them just to be more careful and considerate of each other.

Half an hour later they go inside, and one hour after that I get a knock on my door. Their mother has one of the boys in tow and there’s a giant pink and red blotch across his cheek. In hindsight, it actually looks really bad as the kids face is very pale. The mother is very irate and asks me why I wasn’t watching the kids, why I let this happen, why I didn’t immediately call her, etc. she also says her son probably fractured his finger from falling. I tell her sorry, I thought they were ok. She continues yelling and tells me that I’m irresponsible. She literally even pulls out the racism and says that “the Hispanics” like me don’t know how to raise kids. The argument ends with me telling her to get off my property and her continuing to yell for several minutes after I shut the door. I’m speechless. The whole thing seems like a non issue to me, but maybe it’s because of how I was raised.

The next day the two boys come ring my doorbell alone and apologize for what happened. I tell them it’s okay, just don’t fight each other from now on.

Am I the asshole? Is the mother right to be angry with me?"
319,b7ikm1,"AITA I told a Jehovah's Witnesses lady that her religion is evil  JW is kind of cult like and are known for their abuse so fuck them. I am aware the members may not be aware of this so I usually tolerate them and excuse myself. I haven't seen them around in a few years so I was surprised when I saw one in front of my house. I was going to ignore it but she literally said my name and that my car was here so I was a bit freaked. Turns out it was one that came and gave me her number after 5 minutes of JW jargon a few years back. She apparently wanted to tell me about it more, though I already told her I am not interested in religion. She came because she wanted to try again since I was probably ""too shy"" to call her.

Back then I was more patient but now I didn't have the time to listen to her so I told her I wasn't interested and to have a good day. This only made her want to explain more. I've had this debate too many times so I didn't even respond. She went off and I tuned her out until she asked to come in. Obviously I didn't want crazy in my house so that was a big no but I understand that she probably been in the house (my dad can't say no to these people) so she didn't think it would be a big deal.

She wanted an explanation, I already told her again that I was not interested in religion and she wanted to know why. She kept trying to guess what happened to me ( media, friends, abuse). She asked about  abuse to a literal stranger it! It is weird because JW is known for abuse then using religion to blame them. I kept saying it was just not my thing but she didn't accept that so I said ""In my opinion religion is evil, especially yours"". That...did not go very well. She wasn't angry just very sure that I was confused and something must have happen to me. I basically told her I had something to do and quickly close the door.

I don't know what I could've done! I tired to give a simple answer but she wouldn't just accept it."
320,ah01yi,"AITA for refusing to give preferential treatment to a ""famous"" rap group at our after hours diner? Boss is furious with me. So bear with me in this one, I don't feel like the asshole but who knows, boss my have a legitimate complaint. 

I work at a 24 hour diner but since we are right down the street from our University town's party district, by far the most lucrative hours are between about midnight and 7 am with a real peak between 2 and 4 AM. Students and club goers have eaten at our restaurant for 60 years and up until recently it was owned by the same family. I worked for both the old family and the new owner and things have changed dramatically. Old family's basic rule was every single customer gets treated equally. For example we get a 30 minute wait list every Thursday, Friday and Saturday and old owners were somewhat famous for making a presidential candidate who was wanting to dine with our teams football coach wait over an hour for his table. 

New owner is a little bit more social media savvy and he'll let our city's famous instagramers, members of the football and basketball team, his friends, etc... but he's never formally revoked the ""everyone gets treated equally rule"" because most of our customers love it. 

So Saturday night I was working the host section and working as manager, at about 1am we had a 45 minute wait list and kitchen, busing and wait staff were all busting our asses to get people in and out.  All of the sudden an entire entourage was standing in the front of the line just acting like entire self entitled douche bags. It created a minor stir in the restaurant as I guess these guys are famous enough to get noticed but it wasn't anything like an A lister like Drake or Cardi B popped in. The manager of this group came up to me and said they'd like to be sat. I told them we had a wait list and its the policy that there's no special treatment. The manager pulled the ""do you know who we are and what we can do for you"" line and I told him he could see by the people that were in line out into the parking lot in January that we really didn't need any help and I'd be happy to put their name on the list. Then the ""star"" of the group came up to talk to me and he was just a total obnoxious piece of shit telling me that he would put me on Instagram ""in a bad way dooooodde…..""
 and that he and his crew were hungry. I told him I'd take his name and call him when his spot came up. He basically said as loud as he could ""fuck this shit we're going to Denny's"" and then left without causing any more trouble. I had to ask another person who he actually was to find his Instagram to see if he blasted us but so far nothing. 


So I got off shift at 8am the next morning and by 10 my boss was blowing up my phone asking me how I'd made such a horrendous mistake and basically furious because I'd ""blown"" so much free publicity by not letting this group get preferential treatment at HIS restaurant. I told him about the policy and he told me (and I quote) ""that policy was fucking stupid and you're fucking stupid if you think we're still enforcing it, use your fucking brain."" 

I calmly asked if he'd put it in writing because those of us who'd been around for a few years were very used to the old way and he told me (paraphrasing) ""it would be a public relations night mare to OFFICIALLY change something like that so he relied on his managers to not be fucking idiots every once in a while."" 

He didn't fire me which is good because I really need the job but I'm fucking pissed that he talked to me like that. But worried I could have just been a little more flexible and avoided the whole situation. 

basically AITA?

321,bb20fv,"AITA for telling my neighbor to call the cops instead of just threatening it? Okay, so my husband and I moved out of state recently. He moved before me and about two weeks after he moved, I came for a visit to bring the pets. In our new rental house, we don't have a driveway or parking, so we street park just like everyone else on this street. On the last day of my visit, my husband and I went out to eat and when we got back to the house, our neighbor came out of her house to inform us that we shouldn't be parking there (on the street in front of her house). She talked to us for about ten minutes about people parking there and having to get the cops involved and how she was mad about the way our rental was constructed, which has nothing to do with me or my husband. She finally stopped talking and we went inside with a funny story about our crazy neighbor.

That was about a month and a half ago, and now I'm living here. My husband started parking his car further down the street to avoid more interactions, but I recently purchased a car and there isn't room elsewhere to park, so I started parking there again. I'm not in the no parking zone, so I didn't see the problem. There's a clearly red-painted part of the curb, so I always make sure I'm not in the red, so to speak.

Today, our neighbor came pounding on our door to tell us that she's going to call the cops on us because of where we're parking, but she's trying to be a nice neighbor and ""tell us how to live in this neighborhood because I've been here for 66 years, this is just the way it is."" She also went on to say that she is unhappy that we have two dogs and she doesn't like where we put our trash bins. She continues to drone on with complaints and at one point says ""I could just call the cops, but I'm trying to be nice."" I got mad and said ""So call them."" To which she responded to my husband, ""And watch that, her mouth is going to get her into trouble one day."" Eventually we got her to leave.

After she left, my husband was kind of upset with me for how I responded, but I felt it was incredibly disrespectful of her to speak to us like that in our house. This is not someone who has earned my respected, so she doesn't deserve it. I'm not trying to cause problems, but I'm a firm believer in standing up for myself. So, am I the asshole?

323,bp2ye1,"WIBTA if I don't care if I wear the same dress as another girl to prom? I'm planning to go to my high school's junior prom this year, and I haven't picked out my dress yet. I was planning to just go this weekend and buy a dress less than $200 for the event.

&#x200B;

I don't have many regular female friends that I hang out with, but in class today the topic of prom came up and I was talking to a few classmates about buying a dress. Someone asked me if I had checked the Facebook group, and I told her that it really wasn't a big deal to me if my dress matched with someone else. All the girls were taken aback and shocked that I matching dresses wasn't a big deal to me. They then tried to explain to me how upset someone else would be if I wore the same dress as them to prom, and I really can't wrap my head around it. So what? We're wearing the same style dress, or we're wearing a similar color. Why does everyone else make it a big deal? I even asked them (rhetorically) ""what would the other girl would do, deck me? Cry?"" and to my surprise they answered yes. I can't fathom how materialistic someone has to be to react so seriously to wearing similar clothing.   


I personally just felt that if I liked a dress, and if that dress looked good on me, I should get it. I don't like that fact that I have to change my choices based on other people's choices. The other girls can wear whatever they want, and I can wear whatever I want too, so why is it such a big deal? My classmates also told me that it's ""inconsiderate"" because I'd be ""ruining their night"" or whatever. But seriously? Wearing a similar dress to some other girl is going to ruin her night? That is another level of petty, from my point of view. The only people that I'm making a conscious effort not to copy would be my two close female friends. Other than that, I don't really understand why it would be a big deal to, let's say, a student that I rarely interact with that goes to my school or something.  


Would I be an asshole if I just went out and bought whatever dress I liked, and didn't bother checking the Facebook group (since it wouldn't matter because I would just pick out a dress I liked anyway?) because there are like 150 girls part of that group and I am *seriously* not about wasting an hour to look through all of those dresses."

I wasn't super thrilled her boyfriend was coming because I had only ever heard her questionning whether she really liked him so from the beginning it felt weird. They have been together for over two years, they don't have children or joint responsibilities. The last time she came over without him she hooked up with one of our other friends but didnt tell her boyfriend when she returned. She has continued in this relationship and continued questionning their being together. 

I kept an open mind to them coming and put a lot of effort into hosting them both for four days, cooked them meals and made plenty of plans as he had never been to England before and I live in London - so there's a lot to consider. 

Her behaviour towards him, I thought, was very cold - she made plenty of jokes at his expense. When she shouted ""you're so dumb"" in front of a group of people, I called her out for being mean she said she had learnt all about how to be mean from me. I was floored that 14 yr old me was somehow to blame for how she treats people today. 

That same night we had a lot of drinks, her SO when to bed and me, her and my partner stayed up for a bit longer. She then dominated the conversation talking about how much she didn't liked him, didn't find him attractive, thinks she is still in love with this guy who was dick to her when we were 18 (the guy she cheated on her previous long term boyfriend with) 

After they left, I felt really exhausted, hugely unsettled and just genuinely disturbed. I put some thoughts down on paper and deliberated for some time on whether to confront her but felt the need to set some boundaries as there was some expectation for them both to come back to England and the four of us go on a break together - the idea filled me with dread. I also decided I would want a friend to tell me if they had felt concerned with how I was treating somebody. I spent some time trying to make the message softer but ultimately still clear. I said she was being cruel in stringing him along that it probably wasn't making her feel very good. I was shocked she would let him consider quitting an amazing job to move here with her. I urged her to take responsibility for actions and try and push herself in a positive direction. I also said I wouldnt be seeing them both together again because it felt uncomfortable and waste of everybody's energy - not least theirs. 

She wrote back a huge message in which I could see she really didn't appreciate that I had said what I said, she said I was horrible for judging her and for not wanting to see them together again. She is apparently, ""very fond of"" her boyfriend and I am sanctimonious.

5. What’s the end game here? A serious relationship, marriage? Have you (the dude) discussed what will happen if the young woman gets pregnant?

I know, I’m not the girl’s father, but no one else in her family is asking these questions. Her mother is fine with the relationship (which boggles my mind). 

So, fast forward to the visit. Niece and old dude show up. I’m cordial. I wait till evening, after everything is settled and dinner is over, and I invite the dude to join me on the porch for a beer. Just me and him. Then I start asking my questions. 

After only my second question, the guy starts getting defensive. He told me this is “None of my business.” I got a little pissed at that. 

I told him he’s staying in my home for a week, I can ask him a few questions. And the girl is my niece, I’m not out of bounds here. He told me I was making him “uncomfortable”. I replied that I’m uncomfortable having a dude who’s clearly taking advantage of a young girl stay in my home. I said You can answer my questions and act like you’re a stand-up guy, or feel free to hit the fucking road.

Well, he left. My wife and niece were upset with me. They said I acted like a jerk and that if my niece is happy, to let it go. Again, I was told it’s none of my business. They have since broken up, which I am glad about. Not sure if my actions were the cause.

So Am I an asshole for questioning this guy?

EDIT: some info:

I asked my questions in the order written, and only asked him the first two before he got “uncomfortable”.

I would certainly do the same thing with any older woman my son brought home. 

When I took the old dude outside for a beer, I neglected to mention we had 5-10 mins of talk. We discussed the new Star Wars movies of all things.

I would love to discuss more with some of you, but I was a bit hot-headed and appropriately banned for 5 days. So it goes.



FINAL EDIT: Some of you wondered if I would accept any of the dudes answers to my questions. Of course, all he had to be was respectful and honest in answering and I wouldn’t have a problem. 

Talked to my niece this morning. She and I are totally fine. Knew my actions came from wanting to keep her safe. I apologized for my actions regardless. 

Asked why they broke up.

The guy was cheating on his wife. He confessed it to her and said he would get a divorce for her. Has three kids. All her age or older. She dumped him."
327,c04s7l,"AITA for half-saving a spot in line? Just happened and I honestly don’t know. Must say that I hate even this little amount of confrontation.

Just was at a small clothing store. It has only two changing rooms and was very busy today. I pick out my clothes and go to the line to try them on which has 6 people in front of me. The lady directly in front of me asks if I could hold her spot for a little while she goes pick something up. I say ‘sure’ expecting her to be right back. I continue standing in line and during the span of 10-15 minutes all of the people in front of me go through the rooms. As I am the next person to go right in the lady returns and asks where was her spot as she goes to stand in front of me. I then tell her that she can stand behind me as she was gone for so long and I had been waiting in line for all that time (at this point there are 3 people behind me). At this point she gets angry and says that I should have just told her that I will not hold her spot. 

AITA here to make her stand behind me? Should have I just told her ‘no’ in the beginning? Was I being unfair both to her and the people behind me? Or was I right in the situation because it was such a long time to be gone?"

my boyfriend (25) loves my daughter, he spends time with us, buys her things, and treats her good. we have only been together for about 5 months so we haven’t moved in together, but things are getting pretty serious. i adore my boyfriend, but i’ve always had trouble trusting men. my father was never around and i had a step-dad growing up who did inappropriate things to me (i think you can guess what) so this all makes it harder for me. 

my boyfriend was excited about all of it, he kept asking about the babysitting arrangements i made, but i always dodged the question. i told him last friday because that’s the day i left for the trip and he went on to rant about how i didn’t trust him and that i’m an asshole for leaving my daughter with someone else. i told him that i wasn’t leaving her with strangers, that she was with family, but this made him even more angrier and he said that i was implying that he was a stranger (i wasn’t). 
it totally ruined my the rest of my trip, but once i came back, it got even worse. he tried to make it seem like he was over it, but i can tell he’s not. he makes passive aggressive remarks about it whenever he can, i tried moving on, but he keeps bringing it up.

i don’t want him to leave me, but he’s making me feel more guilty as time passes. it’s been a week and he still talks about it, AITA?

Edit: for anyone who cares, i ended my relationship with this man. thanks for everyone who took the time to reply! and making me feel like a good mom:)"
329,dtssqb,"WIBTA if I don’t wake my husband up but still get upset at him? My husband and i are supposed to go to a national park to go hiking today (its 2 am and we are supposed to leave around 9). We’ve been to this national park to hike before, and I absolutely love it and have been wanting to go back. I am really excited to go. 

The thing is, my husband is still up playing video games. We have had many fights about his video gaming and how i feel ignored and not prioritized because it. 

I know that he will roll into bed around probably 5 or 6 and if I don’t wake him up, then chances are, he will sleep all day and we wont get to go hiking.

I know that it sounds really childish, but i want to not wake him up because I’m tired of having to make him choose me over video games. But i also know that if he doesn’t wake up in time, and we don’t go hiking, that i will be pretty upset about it.

So i am here asking, would i be the asshole if I don’t wake him up later, but still get upset since we didn’t get to go hiking?"
330,d9a94o,"AITA for Venmo requesting for a shared Uber ride two days after? This past Saturday, I called an Uber for me and two buddies going back home. The Uber was around $19. I forgot to split the Uber at the time, so last night I was going to Venmo request them each for $6. 

But then my friend, who was one of the passengers on Saturday, tells me that it would be incredibly distasteful of me to request for an Uber over 2 days after it being called (we were hanging out previous to this issue coming up). Moreover, he was upset at the fact that I was even considering trying to get back a measly $6. He also noted that if I Venmo requested the other friend, who we were not with at the time, that other friend would certainly think less of me for being stingy.

In my friend’s mind, by not explicitly establishing THAT Saturday night that this Uber was going to be split, it was assumed that I was going to pay for the Uber and that they would “get me back” at some point in the future. My friend also stated that he didn’t mind paying the $6, but he was only telling me this because he didn’t want me to continue making this mistake with other people and be perceived as stingy in the future. So I understand that he’s coming from a place of concern.

From my point of view however, if I were ever in an Uber called by someone else, I would assume that it was going to be split and would gladly accept a charge more than a few days later. I understand that $6 might not be a lot of money, but don’t I have a right to request payment for something that should reasonably have been shared? I’m not a stingy person per se, I’m very generous with tips and buying people drinks and whatnot whenever I go out, but this particular situation seems to warrant repayment."
331,bba5qr,"AITA for telling my mum that I don't like my bday gift? This happened a while ago but my mum still likes to bring it up so I decided to share this story and ask you guys for your opinion.

I (25f) am nothing like my sister (27) and my mum and my whole family is aware of that. I have different interests than they do and it's fine (with me).

So last Christmas, my sister got a bracelet from a certain brand. My mum asked me if I'd like to have one too but from the very beginning I said no thanks because I'm just not that into jewelry.

When my birthday was coming up a couple of weeks later, my mum asked me again if I'd like to have a bracelet just like the one my sister got for Christmas and I told her I don't care much about jewelry so no, thanks.

A couple of days later, she asked me what I'd like for my birthday and I literally said: ""Please anything but that bracelet.""

Fast forward to my birthday, guess what she got me: The bracelet.

On a sidenote: This is not the first time, something like that has happened. My mum would very often give me gifts my sister really liked but which weren't quite a fit for me. Up to this point, I always said thanks and accepted them because, hey, it's a gift. But she'd always notice that I didn't really use said gifts and at later points I'd carefully mention that it's just not what I'm into.

So when I saw that I got the exact thing she knew I didn't want to get, I couldn't help but feel hurt. And I told her. I asked her why she would give me the one thing I told her I didn't want. She said I was being ungrateful and we got into a huge fight.

Before my bday I gave her suggestions as to what I'd like to get (I got some of these things too which makes me feel even more like a spoiled child) but I also told her that I'm saving up money for travels so cash would be fine. I realize I sound like a brat for not being thankful for a gift, especially since she got me other stuff too.

But I was truly unhappy with it. Not because it's a bracelet but because of what it represents. It showed me that my mum didn't listen/care all these times when I told her I'm not into that type of jewelry & I'm not gonna wear it and I feel like this was just another low key attempt to change me & make me assimilate to her & my sister. And it also made me feel bad because it was a waste of money too.

So, Reddit, AITA for telling my mum that I don't like my bday gift? I feel like yes. But I can't help it, I couldn't hold my feelings back & I wanted to avoid similar situations in the future.

TL;DR: I told my mum there was one thing I didn't want for my bday and she got me just that. I told her I wasn't happy about it. AITA?

**Edit/Update:** Thank you so much for all your responses! Some of you are saying that she might have bought the bracelet already when she got the one for my sister. I don't think she did because my bday and Christmas aren't really that close together. But who knows? If I had known that she'd already got it without knowing that I wouldn't like it, it would have changed everything. So I guess she would have told me if that was the case.

After I wrote this yesterday, I thought a lot about this situation and I came up with an explanation as to why all of this happened. On other forums, some Redditors keep mentioning the languages of love. I'm absolutely positive that my mum's language of love is gifts/presents. But mine is not. So when I told her I didn't want the bracelet, but I'd rather like other stuff (the suggestions I made were less expensive) she probably didn't know how to handle the situation. I'm assuming that that's why she got it for me anyway!?"
332,bzjo5r,"AITA for asking my Lyft driver to change her radio station away from the Christian/religious rock it was on? I want to rate her drive 0 stars. Maybe 1 for the lovely beginning we had.. I got in the car and didn't really hear the music. Everything was good, totally nice lady having a full on conversation with me. We turned onto a busy road and that's when the talking ended and she kinda turned up her radio which was playing a song chanting ""Our God is amazing"" Fifty times later after the guy sang ""Our God is amazing"" again I just got too annoyed and asked her to change it or turn it off.

She said ""No, it's my car."" In a snarky tone. I decided after about 2 songs later it was a good time to mention I was going to give her 0 stars for semi-forcing me to listen to Christian music. and she said ""Really? You're going to rate me based off of my music taste?"". The rest of the FIFTEEN minute ride was silent (Well, aside from the fucking GOD IS GOOD SHOVE GOD DOWN YOUR THROAT OR GO TO HELL music playing in the background).

I'm at home now and on the rating screen. Would I be an asshole to give her a bad rating, because of this reason? I feel like I'm being a little entitled, but I also think it was (haha) like hell, sitting in a car listening to that music for 20 minutes and she should accommodate to her customers requests. (or just not listen to religious music in the first place while inquiring with other people.)

&#x200B;

EDIT: I didn't blackmail her.  I didn't say ""If you don't change the music you'll get a bad review."" I said ""Because you didn't change the music, I am giving you a bad review."" Mind was already set.

EDIT 2: for the love of Satan this isn't about the dammed music people."
333,efj1ru,"WIBTA if I don’t answer the face time? This is a live situation unfolding...

I live 1k miles from nearest family.  My brother has two small kiddos. My parents (divorced), gma, brother’s in-laws, etc all meet on Xmas day for gift opening. On the years I don’t go home, they face time me in so I can watch my nieces open presents, say hello to all, etc.

This year, I asked what time they’d be calling so I would be ready and could organize my plans around them. My SO and I have 3 Xmas events today but all got scheduled around my “plans” with family.

They’re over an hour late and I have to leave in 10 min.  I have messaged several family and they’re all “people still arriving”.  I suggested they just call me so I can see the kids open my gifts at least. Now crickets.

My nieces adore me. I want to participate. But based on the times my family gave me, I agreed to be at SO’s family thing.

So my options now are to step away from another event to take a call (rude) or just not answer."
334,bxujuf,"WIBTAH if I reported an employee for their conduct off hours at a casino? I’m sitting here with a potentially very career damaging email and I wanted to know if I’d be the asshole if I sent it. 

Yesterday I went to a casino near a convention center after they had their first summer outdoor music festival and things were going great at the craps table. Now I don’t know if many people have experience at these tables but typically on any dice roll you can bet with or against the shooter along with a number of many other bets. I point this out because this is NOT about people winning while others lose because that’s a normal sore loser thing you encounter at these tables.

This guy walks in and jumps the shooter line, typically a faux pas but nobody really cares including me but it all started to go down from there. He was badgering and belittling the shooter, telling them out loud how much he sucks and other choice words. This almost got him into a fist fight and removed from the casino. He would also talk out loud about how large his penis was and how he’d fuck all of the waitresses.

He got progressively more drunk and gave me the same shit on my throw and here’s where the whole report to employer came in. He decided that I must be a barista and called me as such (because I’m young?) and generally badgered me about it. I mentioned to someone else who was nicer that I worked for a large chemical manufacturer in the area and instantly he became uber friendly towards me. 

He was wearing a company shirt the whole time and several times he referred to himself by his first name so it was quite easy to find him on LinkedIn. He happens to be a higher role at a supply chain consultant firm and while I’m not sure if my company uses them it’s definitely something we do contract out.

So what do you say? WIBTA if I sent this professionally scathing email?

**EDIT for info: Part of my job is to be the face of the company at similar conventions and frequently interact with vendors and consultants"
335,aqadzn,"WIBTA if I just followed the terms of mom's will as it was written, 12 years ago? I've shopped this problem around at r/legaladvice and r/personalfinance, and now know that I am only obligated to fulfill the terms of mom's will. Hearsay changes outside of the will, especially the ones you only hear about after mom's dead, don't count.  I guess what I'm looking for is some sort of absolution for what I'm about to do.  


Mom died and my brother and I are supposed to split her estate 50/50. He's a moocher. Not only has she provided 100% of his support for the past few years, she let him live for free on her property ever since his divorce 20 years ago. I've never asked her for a dime, and even arranged for her to meet a nice guy with a good job, which gave her health insurance (as a young widow), along with an annuity upon his death, which ended upon her death.  


Here's the sticky part: Mom's health took a nosedive a couple of years ago. She had major heart surgery, survived, even thrived briefly, then went noncompliant on her meds, took up heavy smoking again, and just did whatever she felt like, whenever she liked. I know that even as recently as a year ago, she was having to remind him to do simple tasks (renew driver's license, pay electric bill), and confided to me that she just wished he would move, she wanted to move into an assisted living apartment.  


Cutting to the chase, during her last hospital stay last fall, she was diagnosed with dementia. Neither one of us know when it started. Yes, that's right: Once she went non-compliant on foods and meds, I distanced myself a little. When she took up heavy smoking again (he smokes, too) I was very distant, and usually just called. In an effort to motivate my brother to take better care of her, I offered him her land and home. It didn't work: His genius idea, and hers (she loved to smoke) was to just tell the Uptight One that everything was, ""Fine, just fine. No need to visit. We're doing very well."" She wasn't. Her death caught me completely by surprise. The way my brother and niece now act, I don't think they were nearly as surprised.  


Supposedly, a couple of months before her death, she told my niece to just sell the place, and move her dad (mom's son, my brother) in with her. While mom lay dying, my niece told me she DEFINITELY didn't want to do that. They've also gotten really crappy about a couple of CD's they say were purchased for them. Mom has three $5,000 CDs, the oldest of which names me as beneficiary: the two she bought last year have no beneficiary listed.  


After all the yadda and accusations (""I never saw you there!"" says my niece, who visited rarely, from 100 miles away), I'm just about ready to split the entire estate right down the middle, 50/50. WIBTA, even if I gave them the chance to buy me out, or partitioned some of the  acreage away from the home, or otherwise tried to make up for the fact that for the last few months of mom's life, I basically bailed? My brother and I were both pretty crummy kids, but he didn't have a job or income, all he was supposed to do was care for mom, and I feel like he didn't do that. (As she lay dying, ""Tried to feed her a chili cheese dog last night. She wouldn't even eat two bites!"")"
336,c22qcx,"AITA for engaging one of my Girlfreinds besties on her behalf? I have a **G**irl **F**riend with regularly debilitating depression. It reaches into most parts of her life; impostor syndrome, uncertain self image, abandonment issues. Her coping tactics are avoidance, comfort eating and self medication as far as I can interpret. She is awesome when shes not beating herself up and I'm a relatively recent component (4 years) as far as her friends and support group go.  

&#x200B;

This past week, one of her top two **L**ong **T**ime **F**riends posted an image of them with two other mutual friends at some music event years ago. My GF's apparent demeanor in the pic was seemingly unenthused as she is with most picture moments and the LTF commented with posting ""GF looks so enthused"" laugh/cry emoji.. which wasn't off the mark and not done in malice im certain.  But as a few of her tactics have begun to take their toll on her being as of late, GF interpreted it as an affront on her appearance and image and it was enough to send her into or exacerbate a depression cycle to the point where she cancelled her commitments for the remainder of the week. The details of the picture were not revealed to me until a couple days after as she didn't want to talk about and revisit the emotions, so all I knew at the time was a social media pic set her off.

&#x200B;

After seeing this cycle into the third day, I texted the LTF and said '*hey, not sure what the pic was but it got to GF enough that shes cancelled work and still not taking it well. I know it wasn't intended to be mean but GF has no grounding for any image/self based humor right now. Please don't intervene now, just please please be aware of it for the near future*"". 

&#x200B;

LTF was outraged and speechless that I would contact her and 'tell her what to do', and it wasn't my place and I was all kinds of out of line by sending her that.  And she did intervene, even after I asked her to hold off if she was determined to, immediately contacting GF which made things even worse.

Yes, GF is hypersensitive and Long Term Friends have been patient and subjected to or witnessed a lot of irrational behavior.

A few days after shes making her way back out of her low point, GF texts apologies to LTF for being hypersensitive to which LTF accepts apology and says she also expects one of me. AITA?"
337,cvxndq,"AITA for snapping at my stepdad, telling him that I can't stand being around him and I frequently question why I keep coming to his house? Obligatory on mobile, so sorry about formatting. This story starts when I was 5 years old, and my mom married a man from a more conservative area, who has a conservative parenting style. I was always an awkward kid, and it turns out that I actually have Asperger's, which was only made known a couple years ago (I'm 16 now, but he still doesn't know about my Asperger's because I don't feel comfortable sharing that with him for the reasons listed below.) So as a result of my awkwardness, I was, and still am, the butt of many jokes from him. I am fine with a few occasional jabs from close friends, but this man joked about almost every little quirk of mine for 11 years, which I am certain contributes to my crappy self-esteem. Fast forward to last night, where I snap at him, already angry about a previous conversation in which he said some homophobic things (I am closeted bisexual), and he tries to tell me that he's only trying to toughen me up with these jokes. I then dropped that as a result of the constant joking, I can't stand being around him and I question why I keep coming to his house instead of staying at my dad's (I'm out to him and he's 100% awesome and supportive). At this point, he went off on me about how he fed me and clothed me for all these years, as well as putting me in contact with someone who could help me get into a very competitive college. He also claimed to be the same way at my age (which I am highly skeptical of), and told me that he understands. If he understood, why is he doing it? More info is available on request."
338,ccj0x9,"AITA I don’t want to take my kid to an autism specialist Parent of a 16 month old boy. Lately I have been wondering if I’m being the asshole in raising my child. He has shown a few signs of what could be considered signs of autism (ie staring at ceiling fans, an obsession with wheels, only says a few words). My husband I brought this up to our pediatrician when we first noticed them and she didn’t seem overly concerned and pointed out several reasons she didn’t believe he did have autism. All seemed fine until grandparents started stating their own concerns because they read an online article about autism. 

Now it seems like every time they babysit him they bring it up. They even went as far to send a list of concerns. Some of them were valid but others weren’t. I am a stay at home mom and spend majority of my time with him so I feel like I know him best and what he can and can’t do.  My husband casually brought his concerns up to a child behavior specialist he works with and she was unconcerned. She said IF he does have any form of autism it would be extremely low. 

On his next pediatrician visit we once again brought up the grandparents concerns and the pediatrician was not concerned about autism. We told the grandparents this and they weren’t satisfied with that answer and want us to send him to a specialist for further evaluation. They say “early intervention is the key”. I want to do the very best for my kid obviously and keep addressing the subject with the pediatrician but am I the asshole for not wanting to pursue it further when I, the pediatrician, and child behavior specialist all don’t think he has autism?

Edit to clarify: Some people seem to think we are refusing to have our child tested for autism and that is absolutely not the case. We insisted on having him screened at the pediatrician office at all his appointments and so far none of them have come back as having any concerns for further evaluation at this time. The next step will be a vision and hearing test to rule out any of those concerns and THEN to see a specialist if any of those tests come back concerning. The issue is the grandparents are wanting us to ignore/skip all of those tests and jump straight into therapy BEFORE he has had a diagnosis because they have google diagnosed him. So to clarify we ARE following the steps of autism testing we just have not received recommendations by a trained clinical person yet to further send him for a diagnosis."

My boyfriend (18M) is moving for college on the last day of the trip which we didn't know about before planning the vacation since it was planned in advance and his schedule was released later. I didn't really want to go on the trip because I wasn't interested in walking around Georgia in the middle of the summer, and while the other family is nice I'd be hanging out with three fourteen year old boys, my mom and their mom. I agreed to go because my mom pressured me to go as she does quite often. I'm currently on the way back from another family trip with my mom and brother where we visited family and friends. I also need to work as I'm paying for most of my college classes/expenses and I need time before I start classes for my own wellbeing. I originally didn't want to go on a previous trip because of an emotional issue involving my ""father"" (the man who was more of a father to me than my dad) since he had passed and I wasn't ready to go back.

I am currently working at one of the biggest companies in my country on a 4 month co-op. So far it has been fine, they offer me food on the regular which is really nice of them. 

But yesterday they had ordered a massage therapist for the team members and my boss (small boss) asked if I wanted a massage and I said no thank you. 

Then the big boss asked me and I again said no thank, but thank you for the offer.  But he said, that this is team perk and I have to say yes. 

I had hoped that would be the end of it but it was not. The small boss came to my desk and said big boss was really mad that I refused if I continued to refuse the big boss would be mad at me and her. She tried for 3 minutes to convince me but I continued to say no thank you, I am uncomfortable with the idea of a massage.

She left saying that big boss would be mad at me for refusing.  As if it were me who had done something wrong. I think that she (small boss) and big boss were wrong in this situation but I am not so sure.

We have done a lot together and are very close. They recently sold their house and are currently staying with Sarah's parents until they find a new one.

 I know her parents fairly well, and on the rare occasion will go over for dinner at their house. Ben and Sarah have two dogs and in the past,  I have watched them/house sat on the weekends when they go out of town. I do this for free, as they are my friends. 

A month ago, Sarah mentions ""Oh, by the way, we need you to watch the dogs at my parent's house the week of July 26th.""  I figure it is just the weekend, but apparently it is Friday-Friday. I tell her I really don't want to do that and that'll be an inconvenience seeing's my work is 40 min away and I have to be up super early. She mentions that she will pay me (half hearted) and I tell her it's not about the money, and that if she can find anybody else, I will do it. 

Fast forward to last Friday, and I get there after work and there is a itemized note for me. Halfway down the list the parents mention ""if you can mow the lawn, we would appreciate it, here's $40 for your troubles"" also, I smoke, (nasty habit) but would never smoke inside someone's house (I figured given history, that would be known, but number 8 is ""thanks for smoking outside"". That comment heavily annoyed me, because it seemed very passive aggressive and not needed. 

Well, I work in a factory 50 hours a week and it gets upwards of 130 degrees. The last thing I want to do is mow a lawn in 90 degree weather when I get home. The only reason I did it, was to be nice. Anyways, they have their dogs on leads, and the whole side of the house is covered in dog poo. I mowed the front, sides and skipped over that section. 

I text Sarah, that I mowed everything but that area, and that Ben could finish it when he got home.  I get the text back ""Please tell him that so it gets done. She paid you and I don't want it to be unfinished when we get home"". That sent me over the edge and I was fuming. I am going out of my way to watch their dogs and she can't be compassionate and realize I don't have to do it? 

Anyways, I kept my cool (for the most part) and responded ""I'll let Ben know. Your mom can keep the $40 though"".  I feel that I did them a huge favor and I was taken for granted. I am still hoping i'm not crazy they realize they were in the  wrong.  So, AITA here? 

TL;DR I was expected to navigate through mine fields of dog turds for $40"
342,dfs5s3,"AITA for ordering wine when out with family and then abandoning them in a foreign country? I (18F) had my 18th birthday a few months ago. My parents aren't vehemently anti-drinking but they're very pro-21+ and have never been the type of parents to let their underaged kids have a small sip of something alcoholic. I've drank before, usually in friends' basements or at parties but I've never been dangerous about it. I graduated from HS in June and am taking a gap year to work and save up some money before starting college next fall. My parents graduation gift to me was a trip to Europe, because I've always wanted to go and I've been learning French, Italian, and German for several years. We did a tour of those three countries and Great Britain. The legal drinking age in France is 18, I checked. Even Americans can purchase and consume alcohol at 18 though the law in America is 21.

On our first night we went to dinner at a nice little place in the 17th arrondissement. Everyone ordered their drinks, I ordered a glass of water and a glass of Bordeaux. My parents had brought my grandparents and my aunt and uncle with their younger kids. Everyone was acting like it was the biggest deal. 

I would like to note, I paid my own way to Europe. I had some graduation money saved up and I've had a part-time job with very little by way of bills and expenses so I had a nice little nest egg saved up. I paid for my ticket and my Euro-Star tickets, all souvenirs. My parents paid for hotel rooms and meals. To compromise with my parents I offered to pay for my one glass of wine on a separate tab. My mother in particular was absolutely pissed off at me for the wine, she kept insisting that ""she was going to have to drag my drunk ass around Europe and I'd ruin the trip for everyone."" 

My aunt and uncle are mildly Fundie christian and teetotal so they were convinced I'm going to corrupt their children. They ended up ruining my first night in Paris because they wouldn't stop harassing me. I literally had one glass. I never go over one glass when I'm in public. Their dramatics over the wine ended up making me leave them. I went back to our hotel, grabbed my backpack of clothing and sundry items and found a hostel. I ended up bee-bopping around Europe by myself for several weeks.

My family does not speak any foreign languages. They brought a language guide and their phones to translate everything. I have a pretty decent grasp on a few languages so I was fine. I plan on studying language and customs at school next fall. From what I understand my family ended up returning to America after four days instead of staying for the full two weeks that were previously planned.

I thoroughly enjoyed myself and returned home. Mom was still as angry at me as she had been that day in Paris. AITA for everything I've detailed above?"
343,e31xkv,"AITA for not wanting my dad's internet love interest to be at family Christmas? There are several layers to this story.

1) My dad just got a smart phone for the first time in his life this year at age 62. Prior to this he never owned or operated a computer, and doesn't understand what the internet really is. He is now learning, just as millennials had to learn as kids while the internet became more widespread. However, all the pitfalls of the internet that came over time for millenial children, my dad is facing all at once. For example, he doesn't understand the concept of catfishing. He just falls for any woman online who's willing to talk to him and tell him what he wants to hear. My dad is extremely gullible. Has given his SSN to strangers.


2) My mom and dad have been divorced since I was 5 years old. My dad wasn't around much when I was a kid, but he got his life together when I was older, and has really tried to be there for me, my brother, and my mom. I have no desire for my parents to get back together, so lets just get that out of the way. My mom deserves way better. My dad tries to help and be there for her, which is great, but I think they're better off as friends. 


3) So my mom is taking care of her mom's house while her mom is in a nursing home. My mom had been living in the in-law unit at her mom's house before her mom went into the nursing home. Now my mom lives in her mom's side of the house, and my dad moved into the in-law unit last year to help my mom by paying rent.


4) My dad started talking to this woman on Facebook a few weeks ago, and he wants to meet her. Which is fine. I just feel like he should meet her on his own first, and they should get to know each other in real life before having her meet us. 


5) My mom has dated other guys in the past, and while some of them have spent Christmas with us, they've always been introduced after my mom has known them for a while and not introduced on a holiday. I would have no problem with my dad bringing a woman he's seeing seriously to Christmas, but I would really prefer to have met her under normal circumstances--not a family holiday. Meeting new people is stressful, and I can't really get with the idea of having a stranger at a family holiday.


6) For most of my life, Christmases have included my mom and my dad, even when my mom was seeing someone who was also present. So I would have no problem with my dad's lady companion being present if they were already serious and I already had a chance to get to know her. I didn't bring my boyfriends home on a holiday to meet my family.


7) I am pregnant with my first child, my parents' first grandchild. I planned to do a reveal with gifts at Christmas. I don't feel comfortable doing it with a stranger there. We were also going to bring my grandma home on Christmas for this purpose. Having this stranger there just makes it feel completely wrong. Like hi, welcome to the family, you're an instant grandmother! I hate it. AITA?"
344,bgqoud,"AITA for talking to the investigators So I'm part of a student organization that is currently being investigated by our college for some hostile environment stuff (hazing/sexism/other bad dynamics sort of stuff). I am aware of a lot of these problems and have experienced many of them first hand. Without getting into details, one member of the organization was pretty homophobic and really did a number on my enjoyment of the activity. The only reason I have not quit this organization is that I really love the activity. 

As part of the investigation, interviewers were supposed to talk to each of us and try to determine whether the problems we had with the hazing event were characteristic of larger dynamics. They never interviewed me and I had some things that I wanted to say, so I contacted the disciplinary board and asked if I could talk with them. We scheduled a meeting and, while I didn't lie, I said some true things that may have increased the amount of trouble people were in."

As he does this he goes all over the place. From the pub, to a friends, to our house etc. and I absolutely hate when he’s in the house with his friends. They usually stay in the kitchen, and I usually stay in the living room. They can be loud and I don’t really feel comfortable when they are there. Not to mention there can sometimes be hash and cocaine, And can get themselves into a right state. My mum usually goes to bingo on a Thursday so a lot of the time it starts then. I tell her that I don’t like them there and that I feel very uncomfortable, but she just tells me that he has the right to have friends over and that I’m being horrible for not being okay with it. We have quite a big shed out in our back garden. It used to be lovely, but the years of partying and drinking in it has ruined it. My other brother and him sometimes go in there with their friends but not often. When I ask my brother or mum if he and his friends can at least go out to the shed to do their thing, my brother says that it’s too cold and my mum just gets stressed and tells me to stop overreacting. There is a heater out there, but it costs about €4.00 an hour and if they want to turn it on my mum demands they pay up. So they always end up in the kitchen. My mum also says that she’ll be home at 10:30 and will kick them out if they’re extremely drunk, but she never does. She’s a very naive person and can be a bit of a pushover. He also always says that its only him and like two people but more of them always end up coming in. When they’re there I feel so uncomfortable walking into the kitchen. So help. am I overreacting, or are my feelings justified?"
346,e2sc15,"AITA for constantly asking my boyfriend to drink less? My (20F) boyfriend (20M) comes from a family where getting pretty drunk at social events is the norm. On my side of the family, my mom has sworn off drinking, and the only alcohol that has been in the house for the last ~25 years has been for cooking off in sauces.
I respect my moms decision but my boyfriend and I both like to experiment and try new kinds of alcohol, generally drinking them pretty casually.
Recently though, he has been drinking upwards of 6 drinks/night on weekends (we are both real lightweights, 6 is enough to be thoroughly drunk). One night while I was out doing homework he drank 9 drinks and called me, at which point I promptly returned to his apartment and helped him safely vomit and checked him periodically during the night to make sure his breathing was normal, etc.
Since that event especially I have been trying to make him understand that 6 drinks, or even 4 drinks, is not really a “casual” amount for him, and on weekends I will often get more and more upset as he continues not to listen to me and drinks more and more. Since it at his apartment usually though, I generally just warn him about the last time he went overboard, but don’t do anything else.
Now however it’s Thanksgiving and we are hanging out with my Dad’s side of the family. His side likes to have a classy glass of wine or IPA with dinner. This year for the first time my parents gave us go-ahead to drink. He decided it was appropriate for him to drink 4 drinks in an hour and a half, all the while talking with my mom and sisters. Even he admitted he was slurring. He likes to say “I’m fine” but I can’t seem to get him to understand that I am not comfortable with that situation and I want him to take it MUCH easier, maybe 3 drinks max over the course of the night, so that my family respects both him and I. AITA?"
347,82renn,"AITA for getting mad at my friend for speaking a different language A friend and I had plans to go to a concert. Said friend is from France, and speaks both English and French fluently.

A week before the concert, he says his brother (who is also bilingual) and brothers girlfriend (english only) were going to come too. I was totally fine with this, the more the merrier.

However, from the time we arrived at the venue to the time we left, him and his brother hardly spoke a word of english, and he basically ignored me the entire time. Leaving me stuck with his brother's girlfriend, who I hardly knew and was frankly not the person I envisioned sharing this experience with.

She was pleasant, but it was clear she was just as uncomfortable with the situation as I was. Even going so far as to apologize and say that this happens to her a lot with them, which I found kind of sad to be honest. 

So after we all parted ways and me and my friend were eating dinner, I brought up how awkward that was, to which he became very offended, and he has been distant towards me ever since.

So reddit, do I have a right to upset about this? Should I have tried harder to switch the conversation to english?

348,edjkaw,"AITA for lecturing/punishing my siblings because they stole? REPOSTING because I got a few YTAs, panicked, and deleted the post. But that felt cowardly. Judge me, I'm ready to accept my fate. 

This literally happened a couple hours ago. I (24M) dropped my siblings (21M and 18F) off at the mall and left to get some errands done. I picked them up a couple hours later and they showed me what they got, and then jokingly/casually told me they stole them. I expressed my disbelief and disappointment, my brother shrugged it off and basically told me to fuck off for acting all morally superior. 

I asked my sister over text about it and she literally said ""Obviously it was wrong but who is it affecting? the billionaires running the company? They don't give a shit"" If we were dirt poor, and they were stealing necessities, I'd understand. But I know my brother's financial situation and he can easily afford the $20 of stuff they took, most of which weren't necessities. I also work in retail so this bugged me even more. Between my sister's attitude and and both of their lack of reasonable excuses, I'm pretty upset with them. 

I'm not devoid of faults. I'm responsible (financially) for getting groceries for my house, money with my parents is tight so I help out. A few times when they asked me to get stuff from the bulk section that's on the more expensive side like dates, I'd write down a different code to make it a little cheaper. It's wrong, but money has been tight for me too paying for groceries and half the bills in our house, my parents aren't terribly sensitive of the fact that I don't have an unlimited grocery budget. It made me feel a bit better saving some money but I didn't feel good about it overall, haven't done it since. I feel that they aren't the same thing but I realize both are stealing and I'm being a huge hypocrite (even moreso for working retail myself) for lecturing them about what they did. 

I usually help my sister with buying stuff online, as she doesn't have enough money for a bank account or anything. I give her $20/month to do some of my chores so she gives me cash and I buy her the stuff and we're square. WIBTA for no longer doing her any favors like buying stuff for her, maybe not giving her any more money etc? AITA for lecturing her on this?

I was annoyed, so I asked the guy, ""do you have a bag for that?"" and he just shrugged and offered a dismissive apology without breaking stride.

352,e3t9b7,"AITA for being friendly with a 16 year old? Title sounds bad but bear with me.

In my city there are bi-weekly lan parties that I've been attending for about 3 years now. These are open for anyone to come and play with us and there's both regulars and people who come by once or twice and never return. I've been coming to these almost every time they're hosted and consider the regulars to be close friends to the point where we grab dinner and do other stuff regularly outside of these meets.

We were surprised one day when one of the people who wanted to play was a younger girl who's 16 who I'll call Jane. There haven't really been any rules in terms of age and people from 15-35 have come. A lot of the people who show up are also women so when Jane showed up I didn't really think much of it. Everyone just played, talked about the game and it was just another night. She has her older brother pick her up and he even stayed to play a few games. Its been a good 7 months since then and shes showed up to every meet save for a few. Just like everyone else, I've been friendly, though I don't really talk with her about things outside of the game we play and general chit-chat (stuff going on in the city, other games... ""how's life"", etc). Still I guess I'd call her a friend? It does feel weird calling a 16 year old a friend but acquaintance sounds a bit too cold so its somewhere in-between. Although Jane's a regular at this point, she doesn't come to any of the stuff that happens outside of the meetups and I don't chat with her outside of these also (besides the group chat for the event).

Me and my gf, who I'll call Jenna, went to the local electronics store recently cause I've been wanting a new TV and she needed new headphones. While we were browsing around I hear a girl call out ""hey, OP!"" and I turned to find Jane there. My side of the conversation went something like ""hey, hows it going?"", ""oh buying a new keyboard? nice"", ""by the way this is my gf Jenna"", ""me im just here to look at the TVs"", ""cool, I'll see you around"". Something I should mention is that while Jenna knows about the meetups, I never mentioned Jane showing up to them. Didn't think it would be important since I never see her outside of the meetups anyways and Jenna has never cared about anything or anyone related to it.

After giving me a pretty worried look I explained. Jenna seemed like she was upset that I was even friendly to her at the store in the first place, and that a 16 year old girl and a 24 year old guy have no business talking. She said there's no reason for someone that young to be hanging around and playing games with people who are older, and that its creepy that we let her join in the first place. After asking her what she would've wanted me to do at the store, she said I should've just ignored her, walked away somewhere else or only said hi then left, but these are pretty cold to someone you see regularly I feel like. Personally I see nothing wrong with any of this so I gotta ask, who's the asshole here?

Edit: Lot of responses after going to bed haha. I'm going to try to show Jenna this thread and talk with her a bit more and hopefully that'll ease her concerns. Thanks for the input."

354,bqmgqp,"AITA for wanting to drop a 15 year old friendship for my 6 month old relationship? My friendship with Dave- he’s been my mate for 15 years, we’ve been through some shit together, and he’s always been my most solid friend. He’s always been prone to get jealous around me with girls and whichever women are in our lives, either separately or together, he will get very weirdly competitive. However, for various reasons both of us have been single pringles for longer than we’ve been in relationships, but he’s honestly like a brother to me. He’s been a shoulder to cry on when my mum passed away, I helped him buy a house, he bought me my first dog, etc. 

My girlfriend Safia- I’ve known her since last November. My gym buddy had been pushing me to meet her and despite me not really wanting a gf, it happened one day and we hit it off big time. I’ve known her 6 months and I can tell you right now she’s the fucking one for me.

She is never in a million years the type of girl I’d go for. She is completely out of my league. Lip fillers, makeup obsessed, runs around making friends with cats on the street, loves pink anything, calm as anything, has a degree in biomedical science, works for an organisation that *advises the bloody NHS* and is sharply intelligent. When I introduced Dave and Saf to each other I was sure they’d love each other. But nope. Despite me thinking Safia is the most interesting fucking person to walk this earth, Dave has been nothing but hostile to her and is openly rude. She first took it well and privately I apologised profusely to her. Asked Dave wtf his issue was and he called her a bimbo, vapid, etc. 

Since then it’s progressed into him openly calling her blondie (she has dark hair), him telling me she’s after my money, him telling me that I need to break up with her because she’s only using me and someone like her would never want to be with someone like me. Safia has said literally nothing about him, and I know she has an insecure streak where she feels like people don’t like her as it is, so naturally I’ve stopped seeing Dave as much. 

He’s called me drunk last night and told me how I’ve let a ‘loose pussy get in between him and I’ ... I’m honestly done with his guy. Am I doing the right thing by severing this relationship? In the last 6 months my life has been getting better and better- and coincidentally I’ve been seeing him less and less. Him disrespecting my girlfriend is the nail in the coffin as far as I’m concerned, but my other friends think this is a classic case of me being caught up in a shiny new relationship and not seeing the bigger picture."
355,d2lf6e,"AITA for not wanting to pay for a ticket that was bought for me, without first asking if I was available that day. Long story, semi short. Also phone formatting, so...sorry.

Two friends of mine asked me about a year ago if I was interested in joining them to go to a concert of a band we all like. I said that was was very interested and if I was available I'd love to go. When I asked when the concert was I was told ""somewhere in September 2019."" Alright. Plenty of time left.

It wasn't mentioned again until May this year when I asked for an update on the concert situation. The reply I got was. ""We'll look into it"" and it wasn't mentioned again. 

So, 2 weeks ago, on the 23th of August. I get a text message from those friends. ""Ticket has been bought, €60. Its on Sunday the 15th of September. At 12:00""

My immediate reply was ""I can't make it that day, i got prior engagements"" the other party immediately realized that we never communicated in an actual date. Just ""somewhere in September"" and we would see if we could find someone that was able and willing to go in my place. 

I asked around, they asked around. Sadly, no luck.

Then yesterday, on the 10th of September. 5 days prior to the concert. I get a message from them saying ""we put the ticket on a ticket trade site and hope for the best. But if not... well it was €60. What are we going to do about that?""

And at this point I was slightly annoyed. This ticket was bought without consulting me about the price or date. The last communication was made 4 months before that. And frankly, I completely forgot about it. The concert itself has 3 repeating shows at the same venue, the 13th, 14th and 15th. So even if I took the initiative of seeing when the concert was. I still wouldn't have know what day they picked. I work in a line of work where I have weekend shifts at least once a month. And they themselves are very prone on making clear that they are busy and get togethers have to be planned well in advance. 

Now they claim I accepted their invite to join and agreed that while they should have communicated better I still said yes. That I agreed last year that I wanted to go. And so I should at least pay for half of it.

And I disagree. I expressed interest in joining them, if I was available, and they bought the ticket without any communication what so ever.

Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend my much needed money on a ticket i never had a say in?"

To make things simple I'll call them Z and H. However, a few things have irked me about them in particular. One such case was that one time we ate at a restaurant a few weeks ago: 

We were looking at the menu and had been deciding of what to eat. I've told both Z and Y of my general avoidance of spicy food on numerous occasions due to a hemorrhoid problem I've just experienced and my general low tolerance of pain. However, Y really wanted to order the 24 spicy wings platter and because Z wasn't very hungry, Y wanted to share it with me. I was hesitant at first but eventually gave in as it seemed he really wanted to try it. He was nice enough to pick the medium level of spiciness. Unfortunately, once the wings arrived, although both Z and Y found it not spicy at all, I was sweating profusely after the first few bites. I admit I was and still am a pussy when it comes to a lot of things including spicy food. I could only eat around 2 or 4 wings before I gave up. However, Z and Y made fun of me for not being able to eat any spicy food. I told them that I really couldn't handle it and that I shouldn't eat too much of it because of the hemorrhoids. They told me to stop using my hemorrhoids as an excuse and that I should 'train' myself to eat spicy food. I told them that it shouldn't matter to them whether I could eat spicy food or not as it doesn't even affect them as its just a matter of preference. They then told me about how its 'important for your future in the event that colleagues would take you to eat spicy food' and it would make me 'look like a bitch if I refused'. I just dismissed their advice and attempted to change the subject. Now, I'm in no way on bad terms with my friends due to this. It is after all a small matter. However, Z keeps on making fun of me on occasion about the fact that I don't want to force myself to eat spicy food. I just ignore it but it is getting to my nerves. Am I the asshole here?"
357,dvb7i4,"WIBTA for going on a trip that had been a ""guys trip"" in the past? I started volunteering this year at this organization and made close friends with some of the other volunteers. They're a group of guys and I'm not, but they've never made me feel awkward about it. It's mostly guys who volunteer there because it involves some hard physical work but I like it because I'm fit enough and it keeps me in great shape.

Joe, who's a good friend of mine, told me that every year, they do a cabin trip, go drink and fish and whatever for a weekend. And he was organizing it this year because his dad has a vacation house we could use. He invited me and we figured out what I'd need to bring in terms of food and drinks to share. 

Nick and Harry, who are also some of my closest friends there were helping him organize the trip too. And when I asked if it'd be weird because I'm the only chick, both of them and Joe said ""no way, we all know you like fishing and boozing just the same as us all, you should come."" And  ""You're one of the group just like anyone here""

Then, a few weeks later, after I'd taken time off work for the long weekend, another guy Dylan talked to me and said he'd always told his girlfriend it was just a guy's trip, and she couldn't come. And me coming had changed things. Now I don't know Dylan all that well and I was confused why he was bringing that up, so I was just like ""that sucks, hope y'all can figure it out""

A couple days after I'd talked to Dylan, this guy Todd who's friends with Dylan told the group chat that he couldn't go because of ""the old ball and chain"". I didn't think much on that other to be like ""yikes, why's he with someone who he's just thinking is a drag all the time""

Then yesterday, Todd said in front of everyone including me that inviting me was ""ruining the guy's trip for a lot of people"" and I'd ""totally blown off Dylan wanting to talk about it"" and I felt totally shocked.

I said Joe, Nick, and Harry invited me, and it was rude of him to act like I was some party crasher. I'd be there and I wasn't going to try any funny business, and if they wouldn't either, I didn't see why there needed to be a problem.

Todd snapped at me that his wife was the problem and I said that all I ever hear about her is bad shit, why is he even with someone if that's all he ever has to say?

Dylan got mad at me for being disrespectful and I dropped it because I didn't want the drama. But I feel like the group has split in two since, between my friends and I, and the people who are closer with Todd and Dylan. I feel like I'm in the middle of it and I don't want to be.

This is a clear violation of my personal space, and I feel very much uncomfortable having my primary care doctor on speaker with my direct manager. I told my mom that NYC laws makes it against HIPPA and such to do this, but she said my job is too important. She also said that law does not apply to me.

I feel pretty boxed in. I will be fired on Friday if I do not produce a doctors note. I only had 2 prior sick days anyways, once in August, and once in September. I am so confused if I am being completely arrogant in this or not.

359,cnytyf,"AITA for asking our neighbours not to park in a spot that we don't use often? Partner and I live in an apartment complex with an assigned parking lot out the back. The lot is semi difficult to get into, and I find it easier to park on the street. Our neighbours have been parking in our spot sporadically for the last month, and they recently parked across the lines into their spot - meaning that we couldn't even park in their spot if we needed to. 

I wanted to ask them not to park there, as they have a spot and we do use ours occasionally. Partner thinks I'm being unfair by asking them to not park in a spot that we don't use - my argument is that they have a spot and they only started parking in our spot a month ago, they weren't parked there before we moved in and for the first month that we lived there. 

I ended up writing them a note asking for them to not park in our space, or to talk to us if they wanted to park there. 

He still thinks I'm the asshole. Am I?"

We take a short break and I see a ton of missed calls on my phone. His girlfriend that lives in another city was trying to call me saying that he was a bad panic attack from the PTSD. She told me that I needed to go and help him. I told her I couldn't, but she kept insisting that I do. I was the only person she knew to call, but I had an entire group of people depending on me. I didn't go and now she's mad at me because of it.

361,ctxkib,"WIBTA if I stopped inviting my friends to my home over another friend's marriage Recently one of my friends (Johnny) got engaged to another woman. I was very happy for him, most of our friends were happy. A couple of days ago we were together playing Street Fighter and Smash (Johnny included). The friend who’s usually crushing all of us (Andrew) was having a bad day. Johnny beat him and he had an outburst. We took it as him just venting (I was about to start shouting that same match) until he started directing his anger toward Johnny's fiancée. 

He was so pissed over the idea of some “African” dude marrying a Japanese woman. No one in the room even thought about that, his fiancée was born in America and speaks English. And Johnny is definitely not “African” he’s African-American. She’s also American as far as were concerned.

Andrew left. After we were done Sam texted me saying Andrews definitely being a dick, but his position was understandable given he’s been treated like cancer since elementary school on account of him being asian, and he genuinely felt insulted that Johnny was now marrying the woman he admired.

I didn’t feel like that justified putting him on blast. I’m going to hang out with them again today, hoping things get better. But I don’t want this happening in my own home. So would it be wrong if I decided to ban both Andrew and Sam from my house until further notice? I will still meet and hang out with them in their homes unless they don’t allow me, today were at Johnny's house, but I don’t want to deal with this kind of bs if I don’t have to. I might want to ask another on of my friends out for a date (According to Andrew, I shouldn’t bother with her since she’s “Taken” by him. I’ve yet to see him talk to her). I honestly don’t have time for how he’d react to a second “cancerous BMAF relationship”."

When I’m footing the bill, I just would rather we decide on one item and share. 

His daughter always wants a cheeseburger grinder. She likes pizza, she just wants something different than everyone else. I feel like that comes across as entitled, and tonight when I am footing the bill I do not want to buy her a cheeseburger grinder. I don’t want to buy my own daughter something individual either.

About 2 months ago, I was told that my contract would expire in Jan but a new permanent position would be created and I could apply for it.

Well they decided to hire someone else and so I resigned early and will be going back to my old job shortly. Me resigning has potentially delayed the large project and this impacts like 150 staff and could cost heaps to fix it.

They made lots of promises that I would be a natural fit for the new job and 'leaked' how much it would pay to me.  This is now the 7th time that I have been promised a new job and worked hard to get it, only to have them give it to someone else.

364,dr4hzp,"WIBTA if I took a bucket I paid for? So, I live with some people who have dogs, and I’ve got my own dog. Me and my dog are on a different floor of the house then everyone else. Anyway awhile back I wasn’t really going up there very often and when I was my dog didn’t always take time to drink. So I bought a water bucket just for him that would stay on that floor. The bucket upstairs was falling apart and all chewed up, so I paid a little extra for a better quality bucket, it’s meant to hold up to livestock so I figured it could handle a dog. Anyway about a year and a half ago, maybe longer, the dogs were outside and since my bucket was closer we brought that out for them all. But then for some reason I don’t remember it got brought upstairs, and the bucket that was falling apart got tossed. They asked if they could continue to use mine and I said, as long as they pay for me to get another. They never did, but it was fine because at that point I was spending more time up there and my dog was drinking more. Anytime I’ve mentioned it though they’ve offered for me to use the outside bucket that’s covered in algae and all chewed up. “Oh just clean it up and use it.” Imo they should use that because I paid for the better quality one. But I don’t say anything because it’d just cause unnecessary conflict. Anyway, here comes the part where I might be an asshole. I’m working on moving out, and I don’t have a water bucket for my dog. Especially with the recent string of dogs getting sick from algae, I’m not comfortable using that bucket even if it’s cleaned up. I’d like to take my original bucket with me, because otherwise I’d have to pay for another one, and I’d go for the same quality so again, paying a little bit more. My original bucket is still in great condition, so there’s no reason for me to get another one other then the fact that my housemates are using it for their dogs as well. So, WIBTA?

Edit, I know if I did take it they’d buy another one and not use the outside one, so their dogs would be safe and healthy, and not drinking out of the algae bucket."
365,dtag51,"AITA for cutting off my friend for a while after her new boyfriend creeped me out? Some context: a very good friend of mine is a serial monogamist and got out of a serious long-term relationship in June. She hasn’t been single for more than a few weeks since she was 13, and the remainder of this summer was the longest she had gone with being in a relationship in 6 years (we’re both 19.) At the beginning of this semester, she started talking to two new guys. She is one of my best friends and we value each others’ opinions on things a lot, so she introduced both of them to me on separate occasions. The first one (A) is a student at our university and is a super chill guy. The second one (B) is not in school, and is actually a felon, having been to jail for causing a car accident while under the influence. They’re both also 19 years old. Unfortunately, A is going into the marines next summer and neither he nor my friend want to do long distance, so she ended up in a relationship with B that officially began about three weeks ago. 

Another thing to note: I am a lesbian and present extremely masculine. Every boyfriend of hers that I have ever met has been intimidated by me, both because of my appearance and because of the close nature of our friendship, though it has never been anything but 100% platonic on both ends. When I met A, I could tell that he was intimidated by me, but he handled it very well and was overall super respectful and friendly. When I met B, I could also tell that he was intimidated by me, but he handled it by slamming half of a bottle of wine in 30 minutes and blacking out in her bed with his penis out on a Wednesday night. It was a very uncomfortable situation for me, and I told my friend that I didn’t think it was a good idea for us to see each other if she was going to continue to date him. She blew up at me and got super defensive of him even though he’s done similar things at least two other times that I know about. The fight was over a week ago and haven’t spoken since.

Am I the asshole for this? I don’t think it’s unreasonable for me to want some distance because he was seriously gross and weird towards me and creeped me out a lot. Plus the whole blacking out with his penis out thing while I was there didn’t make the best first impression. She and I have been friends for almost six years and I don’t want to lose our friendship over this, but I don’t want to be around her if she stays with him. Thoughts?"
366,awbhry,"WIBTA: Moving on During Marital Separation Backstory:
My soon to he exhusband was abusive and a cheater. He is in the military, and I caught him sexting and owning a tinder account while deployed back in January. He also had multiple affairs before this, that I dumbly forgave. We almost got divorced over a year ago as well, when the cops were called when he assaulted me at a party in front of multiple people. He manipulated me in going back to him, as at the time I was jobless and homeless, and constantly pressured me into coming back as I pretty much had nowhere else to go.

Now, I live with my grandparents. We are seperated as in my state, you have to live seperately for a year to get divorced. It has been three months. In my state it is legal to see other people while seperated (I haven't)

I started talking to someone who is very kind, but they live an hour and a half away. We want to meet up sometime soon, and have both expressed interests in eachother. However, based on my past traumas, I feel very nervous that if I begin seeing someone, he would get angry and find a way to mess with my life. He constantly posts my photos on social media expressing how much he misses me. Constantly messages me about how sorry he is and how sad he now has nothing to come home to after deployment.

I am 100% over him, no chance of ever taking him back. EVER. However, because of his manipulation I feel very worried that somehow i AM the asshole. He knows i want to see other people and constantly calls me, messages me, and etc crying. Am I the asshole, wibta if I end up dating someone. even if it's not the gentleman who has been talking to me. For all I know, we just end up good friends. But a lot can happen in a year and I worry that somehow I would be the asshole moving on and finding someone new.

One person did point out how it seems a bit crazy still being worried about my ex, but as I told them
""I often find myself still questioning myself after many years of gaslighting. With time, I know it will get easier. We started dating when I was 13 and he was 16. I believe, because I met him so young he definitely influenced my rational thinking."""
367,chphc4,"WIBTA if I only walked my dog most of the time So my mom’s border collie who’s is only five years old has aggression problems. As a year or so ago my mom’s ex threw him and now he has ptsd of men. As any time I walk him he’ll go and bark at any guy I pass. If I let anyone pet my dog who’s only one he’ll not allow it. As the people need to walk close to pet her. My issue is my mother since she says I’m making excuses on why I won’t walk him. I can outline two incidents with him since he has proven he will bite if he has the chance. 

For one incident someone had their two pits out and the dogs ran up to sniff my dog and him. He didn’t react much till their owner a white male ran up towards us to get his dogs. My mom’s dog jumped at the guy trying to bite him right away. He also barks at this group the owner hangs with every time I walk past them. 

The second incident is I let a older guy pet my dog every walk I do. As he’s outside enjoying nature usually. Thing is every time I try my mom’s dog will bark non-stop at him. The guy ain’t scared of him since he understands my mom dog just has ptsd in a way. But I’m scared every time I’m on a walk since I don’t want to be held liable. 

Now reason I think I’m an asshole is my mom is mad I don’t want to take her dog on a hike today. My 6’3 childhood friend and me are going to a park. My friend is a male and I’m afraid he’ll bite my friend. As my friend is autistic and will hug a dog without thinking. My dog loves attention, but my mom’s dog will get him. She says I’m worrying too much.

370,eoj08e,"Aita for refusing to serve mould bread to customers. Posting for my boyfriend. Will talk like I’m him to make things easier.

So I work in a hotel as a waiter, and part of our job is to make toast for people during breakfast shifts. 

One morning I find the last loaf we have left is mouldy on the first couple layers, I show my manager and he says just to remove those first couple slices and serve the rest. However, having a mother with health issues I know how deadly eating bad food can be and refused to serve it out right and had an exchange with the manager that more or less amounted to 

“Just serve the bread”
“No”

This went on until the manager just walked away. Since I’m the most experienced waiter there I say to them not to serve the bread and just say we’re all out, so we didn’t serve toast that entire morning. 

Now, my logic is if any slice is mouldy the whole thing is contaminated, and if I serve that bread and someone gets sick that’s going to come back on me. In the past we’ve had members of the kitchen staff with cars run down to a local store to pick up ingredients if we run out so there’s no reason we couldn’t have done it this time in my opinion. My mum seems to think though that I should have just done what my manager said, despite having worked as a chef for decades and knowing basic health and safety in the kitchen, and this seemed to be a common consensus. 

My manager was a little funny for a while and didn’t put me on a couple of functions, but a few weeks later when I finally seen him again he seemed alright with me. 

I feel like I was standing by my principals and still think I was in the right, but AITA that just made things more complicated for the staff and managers?"
371,ci1l0f,"AITA for staying out of a fight between my brother and mother? My family is made up of me (M21), my brother (M13), my mother (F43) and my step-dad (M43). We live in a smaller city, with a population of 60.000 inhabitants in Germany, if that matters.


Anyway, to give a little background information, my mother is not a person one argues with, never being able to accede a point or admit own faults, you could never argue with her. Not me, my brother or my step-dad, for that matter. They already aren't in a happy relationship, but that's not the point of the story. She is definitely mentally ill, perhaps bipolar or borderline from what I can gather, though she would never admit she has issues and would never seek therapy. ""She is an angel, after all."" 


My brother is a person who acts out and lashes out irrationally when he gets faulted, often not knowing when he is fighting an uphill battle, and is a lot like my mother. Easy for them to get into arguments. Likely also has mental issues. 


My dad doesn't play a part in this story directly, but he often gets pulled into these situations. He is often called while at work by my mother, like a child telling on her siblings. I am usually the first person she goes to when they fight, expecting me to somehow ""deal"" with my brother, like she isn't to be faulted for anything. Because a fight doesn't take two people, right? 


My dad is at work. I have off today and wanted to sleep in. My mother is getting ready for work right now after the deed. My brother is home ""sick"". 


Apparently my mother insulted my brother's music taste or whatnot, and my brother got aggressive and ""grabbed her from behind and choked her"", from what I can gather. 


I am quite literally sick and tired of having my mother bursting into my room, waking me up and screaming at me to deal with my brother. A fight with my mother never ends well, and my brother knows it. I haven't the energy to deal with her anymore. So I shouted at them both for waking me up, telling both my mother and brother to shut up and grow up. My mother is of course insulted and says she will never do anything for me again (not that I care, she died in my eyes years ago, that ship is sailed) and my brother is angry because I don't ""understand him"". He can't see it out of my perspective yet. He hasn't given up on somehow winning against our mother. I can't fault him for being angry, she has that effect on people. But I've also told him many times that it's pointless. They're still arguing to this moment. After all I've been through in my short-lived life, I just want peace and quiet. 


I feel bad for my brother. But he is at fault for this whole situation, and I am again being pulled into an argument I can't win. They are both mentally unstable and anything I do could and would make things worse anyway. Why get in the middle of an immovable object and an unstoppable force? Everything for naught. 


AITA for wanting to stay out of the argument? For wanting my peace and quiet?

372,atitsh,"AITA For not giving my group mates credit We were assigned a group project however we were all getting separate grades regarding the presentation. The only thing we had to work together on was a movie trailer for our presentation. That was literally the only thing we were getting graded on as a group, and they failed to contribute. Their slides still aren't done and we present on Monday. My slides are up to the top notch on the rubric and everything. 

In regards to the trailer, I told them at the beginning of this project (2 months ago) that we needed to get it done because it'll take awhile to edit due to the fact that we all have 0 experience editing and I knew they'd fuck around. 

Twice every week I'd propose a new plan to get together and film this shit to get it done. Each time I was blown off or told they were busy. It's ok to be busy but every single time I proposed it they shot me down. 

Fast forward to Tuesday the 19th, and the Teacher tells us that the trailer is due on this upcoming Monday. I panic obviously, so Tuesday and Wednesday my group and I made plans to film and what do ya know, they don't show up. So late Wednesday I talked to my instructor and he said I could do the project by myself and get a single grade for it. I jump on the opportunity and now all my free time has gone towards filming. Today I go to edit and my group comes up and tell me we need to film ASAP. I told them that I already did mine and that it's not ok for them to have messed around and put me off for so long. I told them that they're not going to help me edit and they're not getting credit for it. And then they decided to tell me I'm a bitch and other names.

I, sadly, stayed in a neutral tone even though I wanted to throw them out of an airplane with no parachute. 

Anyway, Was I the asshole to not give them credit? 


TL;DR group members put me off and procrastinated, didn't help with project, I'm not letting them get credit for my work. AITAH?"
373,9swcnp,"AITA for moving abroad while my dad is sick? About 1 1/2 years ago I moved abroad for a temporary transfer of my job to a European office, about 6-8 hours by plane from my home city.  Soon after I moved I met someone at work, fell in love, yada yada, now we're living together and have been going out for about a year and are talking about getting married.  She's really wonderful and supportive and I'm sure she's the one. 

My parents issue with this is two-fold: first, they do not approve because she is not jewish (which is fine by me, we are both agnostic/atheist). Second (the most important reason) they do not approve because we've decided to stay abroad as she is from here and is not ready to move, and we both have good jobs and lives here already.

Another issue is that my dad is legitimately not well and can't travel because of his health. Its nothing life-threatening, its basically a condition causing chronic inflammation that leaves him in a moderate amount of regularly occurring pain, and a severe amount of pain when walking for long distances or doing other physical activity.  And the stress of my leaving is definitely not helpful to this.  

My family feels that I have betrayed and abandoned them.  The way they are going about expressing it is not ideal.  Saying I am destroying their lives, subtly blaming me for their health problems (e.g. stress is causing me X problem and Y problem and you being away is crazy stressful), sending me pictures of my deceased grandparents to try to guilt me, saying I am betraying and abandoning them, mom having panic attacks, dad saying I wake up 4 times a night thinking about how you are not here and I have nothing to live for, etc.

I try to call/facetime a few times a week and visit every 4 months or so to keep myself present in their lives, and I try not to react too badly to what they are saying (like engaging in a shouting match for example).  I've also tried to rationally explain to them why I am doing what I'm doing, but it doesn't really register.  Personally I am not too conflicted in my decision and am very comfortable with my decision to stay abroad and build a life here.

For those who take that word at a surface level, it doesn’t just mean she’s dependent on my dad- she emulates and manipulates to get what she wants. I know this because I do this. I go to therapy to help myself and Codependency Anonymous meetings. 

Now that I see her manipulation, I am nothing but angry and resentful. She guilt trips me all day long, but she truly believes she has the best intentions. i’m so angry and resentful i can’t even look her in the eye. I have no respect. 

If I could not feel this way, I would. What I wouldn’t give for a good relationship with my family. But i wear my heart on my sleeve and i can’t fake it. She keeps trying to connect with me and I keep rejecting her. I can’t do it.

I told her what her problem is- I said she has a problem with codependency and she will never be free until she addresses it. She threw it back in my face. Everyone else is always the problem. 

So AITA for not wanting a relationship with her unless she helps herself? I am in so much pain over this. I feel like an asshole.

"
375,awrjd2,"AITA for getting my roommate expelled out of the hostel for smoking inside our room with doors and windows closed and harassing me while our examinations were going on, basically making him homeless? I am a senior year undergraduate, and our college has several in-campus hostels. Each student is allotted a hostel to live in, and there aren't any better places to live around our campus.

This incidence happened a few months ago. I didn't want a roommate, but I arrived late for my semester registration, so, they only had one double room available. So, I and my batchmate, who I didn't know very well, decided to share that room. A few weeks passed, and we were getting along pretty well. But, he almost always seemed high on something or the other, which was not a problem for me on the condition that whatever he did shouldn't affect me. But, he would always be moaning and making weird sounds and doing some stupid stuff which was disturbing.

He was a chronic smoker, and I am a non-smoker. And smoking is not allowed in our hostel. I didn't have any problem with him smoking. My only condition was that he shouldn't smoke inside my room.

Days passed, and things started to fall apart between us. I always tried to be patient with him and often compromised, even with his ridiculous demands. One of his requirements was to switch the lights off whenever he wanted to sleep, which would sometimes be pretty early. Irrespective of whether I was studying or working. But, I complied and started using a small table lamp instead of room lights whenever he used to sleep. After doing this for a few days, he asked me even to keep the table lamp switched off. I did that for the night he asked me to do so. Things started to escalate that night when he asked me to change the orientation of my bed and table so that the light from my laptop won't disturb him. It was painful to rearrange a bed and study-table, and I was working, so, I said that I would do it in a day or two. When he insisted, I strictly told him that I wouldn't do it.

Next day, he was in a bad mood because of last night. So, he started smoking inside the room to irritate me. He didn't stop at that. It was a hot and humid summers day, and he began by closing all the doors and windows of our room (while he was smoking). The switches to control lights and fan in our room was on his side of the room, so, he switched them off and told me that I couldn't switch them on as I was no longer allowed on his side of the room. I warned him 10-12 times to stop doing this, but he didn't listen.

So, videotaped him smoking in the room and sent an entire narration of the events of that day along with the proof. Soon, they allotted me a new room, and he was expelled from our hostel while our examinations were going on. It's a tedious process to get a new hostel, so, he was probably left homeless. The warden reported him to the Dean of Student Affairs. I didn't follow up on what happened to him after that.

So was freaked out, and I tried to comfort her as best I could while not being physically with her as I was visiting my family in another state for the holidays. Well, a few days later, we meet up and long story short, she broke up with me. Little bit of context: I wanted to marry this girl. I told her I wanted to, and she said she reciprocated those feelings. I was head over heels for her, so when she called it off, I was devastated because I was losing my best friend/girlfriend that I thought I was going to spend the rest of my life with. 

The night we broke up, she sends me a text saying that she wishes the best for me and so on. Since Sunday I think I've smiled once. Everything has been so emotionally draining and even people I was at a NYE party with knew that something was wrong, but I didn't want to bring it up, kill everyone's mood, and ruin the party. 

Yesterday, she sends me a message saying that her grandma got better, she was getting out of the hospital, and she could go home with routine visits to the doctor. I tried sending a message a few times, but ultimately I didn't respond because I broke down crying the few times I did. 

Today I got a message from her essentially saying ""Wow nice to see you care, I won't ""bother"" you anymore. Goodbye."" I sent a message back saying how confusing it is for me to get messages from her and expect me to respond like nothing happened, and she responded with ""It's not about you."" I finished by saying it's a little unfair that you said you'd give me space, and then get mad at me when I'm not ready to respond yet. She didn't text back, and now I'm wondering if I really am the AH here by not responding or at least acknowledging that I saw the message?

377,dino11,"WIBTA for telling my mother what she can and can't do? I'm going to attempt to make this as short as possible but I have a habit of making short stories long and long stories longer so bare with me. TLDR at the bottom.

My (25F) mother (53F) fled our state three years ago after getting in trouble with the law involving drugs and getting a felony charge. She was unable to get a job and pay her fines and had a warrant out for her arrest so she fled. Since then she went to rehab and stayed in their sober living treatment facility and paid off her fines and no longer has a warrant.

Since she's no longer wanted in this state she wanted to move back to be closer to me, my daughter, my minor (14M) half brother, and my grandmother who recently got diagnosed with cancer (her mother). 

I opened my home to her under the stipulation she stayed out of trouble. She's been here a week and is having trouble adjusting since whole staying at rehab she was constantly around other people and didn't have to cook or do laundry for herself. I haven't been around much because since she's been back, I work four days of long hours and then have four days off which starts tomrrow. 

She's expressed feeling lonely, which I understand, and because of such has recently told me that the next time I go back to work for four days she will be leaving to visit friends. I do not agree with this because said friends are the people she hung around with when she got her felony drug charge a few years ago and still live in that very same town.

I feel like her being around the same people and being in the same area could very well lead her to relapse. And while I sympathize that she isn't taking to being alone a lot more than she's used to, I also feel like she's going to need to get accustomed to this as this is very typical of being off on your own and she has me and other family to keep her company. To clarify I'm not against her having friends, just against her going to visit friends who aided in her addiction (although they are supposedly sober now) in the town where she got in trouble with the police and most likely knows where to get drugs if she isn't strong enough to stay clean.

TLDR my now sober mother is living with me while she gets back on her feet but has made plans to go visit previous drug addict friends in a town where she got into trouble with the law and knows where to get drugs. I disagree with her doing this. 

WIBTA if I told her that while she is staying with me she is not allowed to visit these friends otherwise she will have to find somewhere else to live?"
378,em266s,"AITA for sending my brother a replacement bowl? So back in September my mom stayed at my brother's house and watched  her grandkids while he and his wife went to Vermont. Last night he told  me how she lost their ""favorite giant metal bowl"" and they were so upset  and looked all over the house for it. Under beds, in the garage. I  legit was cracking up laughing at the story. He even mentioned that she  had to ""do a half batch of cookie dough"" because ""they didn't have the  right bowl. So I sent him and his wife a GIANT metal bowl on Amazon.

 He just informed me that she is PISSED that I sent the bowl (it was a  $20 bowl) because ""She wanted to pick out the replacement"". WTF? I even  included a gift note that said ""For your cookie dough."" I thought at the  least they'd get a laugh out of it, even if they never used it.  Mind you it's been since September. And the way he told the story, it was legitimately funny. Even joked at one point that they considered asking me and my husband to see if it was at our house (my mom lives with us). 

Was I in the wrong here?"
379,bdq4fb,"WIBTA for not bringing my roommate home for easter after a fight? (Throwaway account because my roommate uses reddit)

My roommate (20 M) relies on me (20 F) to give them a ride home during weekends while we are away at school. He had asked me last week if I could give him a ride home for easter. Which initially, that seems like a great idea. I live 4 hours away from school and it would mean that I wouldn't have to be alone for that ride. Now he has been my best friend for two years, he has helped me through a lot of stuff and in turn i've helped him.

Now recently, He has started to act really weird around me. I just got accepted to another school for next year in my home state and would be far away from him. He just got a new girlfriend. We have had our own lives and in the past we have been able to make it work. But what has been going on lately was that we would make plans with friends and he would cancel on us like 15 minutes before we were going to leave. His reasoning was always either he wanted to hang out with someone else (girlfriend or other friends). It didn't even matter if it had been planned for weeks, we would get the same BS reasoning. I'm a rather passive person and usually just let these roll off of me, and we would still go and have a good time. Until last week, we had changed these plans to accommodate my roommate, so it messed up other people joining us because we really wanted him to join us. A mutual friend and I checked in the morning of these plans and he seemed super excited, face lit up, and said of course we are still going. He suggested we go and get coffee at a popular coffee place near our campus, basically inferring that i should drive him and his girlfriend. I agree and we go, everything seemed normal.

Later in the day, like 45 minutes before we are going to leave, he comes home and mutual friend and i are sitting in our living room. Roommate says he doesn't want to go anymore. He would rather be with other friends. I finally snapped and had to leave the room because i'm so sick of being treated terrible by him. I cried in my room like a child because i don't understand what has changed.

I sent him a text later in the day saying that it wasn't cool how he was treating me and that it only seemed like he wanted to see me when he needed a ride or just needed something from me. Our mutual friend also texted him because I only have a few weeks left at this school before summer and i'm transferring to a different school in the fall. He responded to both of us saying that he was just overwhelmed by school. Now whenever he ditches us, it's to see a different friend or his girlfriend. Not to study. I understand yes, new girlfriend is exciting and everyone has other friends. But when it has been the past 4 or 5 plans, some even HE came up with and wanted to do.

Would I Be The Asshole for not wanting to drive him home for easter anymore? I gave him until Tuesday to try to clear things with us and since he didn't, I don't want to spend 4 hours in a car with him."
380,6f0zxh,"AITA for not wanting to hang out with my ex Ok, so My ex and I broke up like a week ago. We broke up because she has serious trust issues, and swore up and down I was cheating on her (which i wasn't, I'm not a cheater.). I got tired of feeling like I constantly have to prove myself to her for nothing. (I  also know that when a woman constantly accuses you of cheating, and you know you're not, then they're probably the ones cheating.) 2 days after that, she came over and we talked so she could have closure. I guess she construed it as I want to get back together, which is far from the case. So she wants to give me a second chance that I didn't ask for. So this morning, she calls me and asks if I want to hang out with her, I say no, I have things I need to take care of. Rent's due and such. And she goes on this tangent about how I'm an asshole and how she was so in love with me, and I betrayed her and all this hoopla. Mind you, we only dated for 2 months, when last year, I didn't even know who this girl was. And she's in love with me? No fucking way. Anyway, Am I the asshole here?

381,ck9cy4,"WIBTA if I abandon my friend in a long-term abusive relationship?  My friend who I've known since school has been in and out of a relationship with a sociopathic gaslighting manipulator for nearly five years on and off.  Each of the (6?) times theyve broken up, I've been there- and now I feel tired, disrespected and feel like I'm helping an addict here. 

That take on her is his own btw. I have nothing against this girl apart from what I see in him each time- confidence sapped, financially broken and losing his shit every. Single. Time. 

Now up until this point I've been like - just be there. Be supportive, let my bro know my thoughts yeah but just be on hand when he needs it. Because he does need people round when he's broken type thing.

But this final time getting back with her recently has got me both bit pissed off, and thinking- am I simply helping or even enabling an addict? 

Some context: this time they split up because his grandma is sick, he wanted to spend more time with his family and she said no, so he walked. (His story)

I helped him again emotionally, to get on his feet with well worked job references and interview prep. Within a few months he has a new job, is nearly out of debt and is on course to moving out of his mom's (who also, in despair keeps supporting him each time and often calls me about it).  

BUT NOW HES DISSAPEARED AGAIN, presumably back with her.  Now im thinking- Its not her thats the problem - it's him. For not having the strength to follow through staying away- and breaking promises to me, disrepecting his mum and his grandma. I'm becoming unwilling to waste my efforts again. I feel like I've been bullshitted year after year.

By hanging out and being supportive of him next time it goes tits up, I feel like I'm backing up the person who is harming my friend I.e himself. 

Next time they split up 'for good',  I'm thinking tough love is needed. In a quite literal sense don't have the time for this all over again as I now have a child- who is far far more important than this recurrent soap opera.

So I'm probably going to straight tell him to leave me alone - at least for a good while until he's sorted his own shit out for good.....But Would I Be The Asshole?"
382,cj3fw3,"AITA for peeing in the night, waking up my mother? For context, I (19F) am home from college for the summer so living with my parents again. 

I almost always need to pee during the night when my mother is asleep, as I usually go to sleep after her and I sometimes wake up needing to go. The issue is that my mother is a really light sleeper, and so sometimes gets waken up by this and precedes to rage at me for *any* noise I have made such as ""tiptoeing too loudly"" or creaking the floors or opening my door and often accuses me of doing this every night. 

I think this is unreasonable as I really do try to keep noise to a minimum, I don't even flush the toilet or run the taps even to get a glass of water after she's gone to bed to try not to bother her. Also she often accuses me of doing this night after night but I only seem to hear her wake up maximum once a week and she'll probably get angry at me once every couple of weeks. 

This is not a new issue either, my mother has always been a light sleeper, and I have always liked to sleep later than she does meaning I often got told off for this when I was younger too, so I think I have become much better at keeping quiet over the years, but now I'm back from college it's different and I feel like an asshole when she complains to me about how badly she sleeps because of me. 

So, aita and do I need to change my behaviour?"
383,bfmw1n,"AITA for getting annoyed that my mom tries to fix everything for me So the title probably sounds pretty bad, and it happened like 5 minutes ago so this post might be a little rant ish but I'll try to keep it short.

About me: I'm 17, male and I'm in my first year of college and have had this job since I was in my early 13s.

So I work at a grocery store, and my mom has worked here since I was about 6 or 7 so at least 10 years now. She often tries to fix things for me there or help me out, which I know has good intentions, but it's often stuff I was planning on doing myself.

This results in my coworkers and managers telling me I should be doing those things myself, and that my mom can't fix everything for me. I know that. I'm trying to do my own thing, but I'm only there 2 days vs her 6 days. She always beats me to it.

Now yesterday she told me to get a replacement for Thursday in 2 weeks. So I said I'd do that. Now I wake up and she's already gotten me a replacement, which I got pretty upset over. I told her that it's nice but she didn't even give me the chance to do it myself, and that I'm gonna get crap from coworkers for not doing this myself.

She demanded I give her an explanation of when something like that happened, but I honestly can't tell her. I have a bad memory and live in the moment for the most part. So I usually only remember that something happened, not what exactly happened or who was even involved. She knows that. But got mad at me for not being able to tell her and kinda guilt tripped me about being ungrateful.

I am grateful that she's willing to help me, but it doesn't help me in the long run and gives me a generally bad reputation at work.

AITA?? Im honestly not entirely sure at this point, since she blames me and gets mad at me for a lot of stuff, but also always says I blame everyone else."

So one of my roommates is super irresponsible with money, and somewhat disrespectful of everyone’s space. He constantly takes our food and borrows money without ever repaying it. For his birthday this year, a couple people got him small gifts, I was not one of them. I instead told him that he was absolved of his debts, which I thought was a generous gesture since he owes me over $50. I know this isn’t a lot of money, but I live tight, and money doesn’t come often for me. He got pissed off at me, and some of his friends said it was a dick move for not getting him a gift since he is my roommate.

385,cx8xxs,"AITA for complaining about employee smoke breaks and eventually getting them taken away? My employer allows two 15 minute paid breaks and one unpaid 30 minute lunch each full day as is standard. It used to allow two 5 minute extra paid breaks a day for smokers only. This pissed me off since I don't smoke and thought it was unfair I was denied a special privilege. Also this was not company policy, just our site.

So I started taking the breaks anyway. I was told that's not OK since I wasn't using them to smoke. So I started doing things like blowing on an empty water bottle or a makeshift roll of grass I'd pull up and standard paper. Eventually I got told by the site director's this was also not OK and if I took an extra break without a cigarette or cigar again I'd be written up. Did I mention he's a smoker?

So I went to HR and complained. HR admitted it was at the site director's discretion and not company policy. I stated this was unfair and discriminatory to punish me and all other non-smokers for it and threatened to go to corporate HR. Eventually I got HR to agree to ""look into it"".

A week later we all got an email the extra smoke breaks were bring done away with and employees would have to punch out for extra smoke breaks now. Lots of people complained. Luckily I didn't get identified as the ""culprit"" but people are still very butthurt. It's pretty clear this was forced by corporate after I pushed our HR to look into it. I'm scared to reveal I did that to the floor.

So asshole? All I wanted was fair and equal treatment, let us non-smokers take extra breaks too and not ne discriminated against."
386,c3nvnp,"AITA for bringing a dog to visit family when they wanted me to? Hi there! I’m feeling like an a-hole, but also confused by this situation... 

My sister is engaged. We planned a ladies hiking trip for this summer. I live 14 hours from my sister. My boyfriend and I have a new dog, and my sister encouraged me to bring the dog on the trip. It’s a dog-friendly backpacking loop and is the perfect opportunity to get him in shape for summer. 

So, I drove down to my sisters’ to get situated before heading out on the hike tomorrow. I got in at 8 pm, we’re leaving at 8 am. (Giving me 12 hours at she and her fiancée place with the dog)

During this time, her fiancé has made it very clear he is annoyed with the dogs presence. He pooped in their yard, I picked it up quickly, he asked numerous times if I’d picked it up.He whispered about how my dogs nails were scratching the hard wood to my sister (they weren’t, I got nervous and checked this after). I asked her if they actually had, and if so, I would repair it. She said they hadn’t. They have a cat I’ve kept the dog away from, or tried to gently introduce, and he was panicked the entire time. He was upset about the dog sloshing some water and said that the wood would raise, though I wiped it up. 

Needless to say, I know that he hates the dog being here. I do feel badly about it. But, I am confused because my sister encouraged me to bring the dog? He is young, but not naughty. I also know that not everyone likes dogs, and it is his home. However, I had no idea that he would hate the dog being here... I will never bring him back, but AITA here? 

Also, my sister wants me to stay for the weekend after our trip. We will be done Friday, she wants me to head home Monday. I want to spend time with her, but feel that her fiancé would NOT like this. I feel torn,should I just say that I don’t want to overstay our welcome next weekend, and leave after the hiking trip? 
Thanks!"

I think I have done anything I could to make sure I stay a good brother.  I even spent months making a photo album for her birthday and drawing highly realistic photos of her friends or just anything she wanted me to draw.
   Now, I honestly know next to nothing about ariana grande but my sister runs her fanpage and has been a pretty huge fan of hers for the past year or so. I am sure ariana grande is a wonderful, kind and amazing role model and wish her the best, but her birthday falls on the same day as mine(tomorrow)  and I am pretty upset by the fact that my sister seems to be completely ignoring me.
   We moved into a new neighborhood last month and I don't have any friends since I just finished school. Parents don't have a solid relationship with us either and they have never really cared about me or given me any gifts or anything. So I guess I placed an unusual amount of burden on my sister by expecting her to spend time with me on my birthday. 
But she is moving to her friend's place for the day and they are going to listen to ariana grande all day or something,  and are even cutting a cake for her.
I took a month to make a life like photo of ariana grande for my sister's fanpage and expected that to be the end of it.
But all this noise about tomorrow being her day and my sister telling me that I should feel blessed about having the same birthday as her made me snap.
I called her selfish and obsessive. She left crying.

388,ais2mp,"AITA For Making My Fiancé Stick To His Side Of The Deal? We have a dog. We have to take turns taking her outside to use the bathroom. Yesterday evening he asked me to take her out, but I said no as  it was his turn, and he hadn't taken her out at all that day. He kept begging because he couldn't be bothered, but I was adamant and didn't want to be a push over. 

He eventually came up with the deal that if I took her out then, he would take her out every time the next day and I wouldn't have to take her at all. That sounded like a sweet deal to me, (Taking her out is a bit of a hassle, especially in the current weather) so I accepted and took her out. 

I Went to bed that night and by the time I woke at about 5am he was still up but about to head to bed. Just before I left he told me to wake him up when I got home, as I usually take her out as soon as I get back from work, and obviously he'd have to take the shift.

I Arrived home later that day and gently roused him, as I'd been instructed. The first thing he did when he woke was ask me to take the dog out. I Reminded him of the deal but he started moaning that he'd hardly slept and begging me. When I didn't cave in he got very mad, even told me to get out his house at one point. He throws that around all the time when he's angry, so I didn't take him serious. Instead I just went to the bedroom (He's fell asleep on the sofa) and stayed there for the rest of the day. He did take her out not long after that confrontation, but was obviously not happy about it, throwing her lead  across the kitchen and leaving it there in the floor instead of putting it away once he was done.

I Had to go out somewhere that evening, and he still seemed a little annoyed even at that point, refusing to say goodbye to me. I Got home again a few hours later, and once again he asked me to take the dog out as he was in the middle of an online game. I Simply Responded with, ""You know what I'm gonna say.."" So he just told me to get out. Now once again, I am banished to the bedroom on my own, where I sit and write this right now, and he is again in a mood with me.

So, am I being unnecessarily stubborn by wanting to stick to our deal? Should I have just done what he said?

If I can defend myself for a moment, I wanna say that I did this out of principle. It wasn't that I just couldn't be bothered taking her, it's that I don't want to be to be a pushover like I have been in this and past relationships. My fiancé is kinda manipulative and good and getting me to bend to his will, so I wanted to start making a stand and end that pattern.

But, it's for you to judge.

UPDATE: Thanks for all your thoughts and advice. Him and I seemed to have sorted things out now. After I was done writing this (I Began just after he told me to leave the room) I snuck back into the living room where he was. He heard me but said nothing and carried on with his game. A little while later he was talking casually to me, even gave me some leftovers from his takeaway, and seemed in a better mood all round."

I’ve texted her once about me craving a snack I couldn’t remember (was hoping she would) and she immediately linked it to me being pregnant.

update: thanks everyone for your responses! to clear things up, i have already talked to my mom about it and she thinks it’s valid to ask me. i however don’t think it’s valid in every conversation. i also should’ve cleared up that she strongly discourages me from getting pregnant at my age and especially with the boyfriend i have now. so her reason for asking is mostly to see if i’m pregnant or i guess sexually active with my boyfriend? idk still annoying."
390,cz85l9,"AITA for taking my family too seriously This happened a while ago, but shit is still coming up about it.

To keep things fairly short, I was a sociology major for a time, I never had any goals other than to help people when I was in school. I told my family in high school that I wanted to be a Case Manager and they told me that I would hate my life and didn't support me whatsoever. I eventually fell into a depression during college that made me swap majors to appeal to my family and then dropping out all together when I was too exhausted to show up to class. 

When I dropped out, I had a talk with my parents about it. We got into a fight because they wanted me to be a big famous artist (unrealistic in today's society and with my level of skill) and I was throwing away my life (which I was). The whole case manager thing was eventually brought up. I confronted them saying that I was surprised they weren't at least proud of my for trying to dedicate my life to people in need and that their constant comments of me ""eventually hating that line of work"" and ""never going to have the money to support myself"" finally got to me and that was my reason for switching majors. I had never received any support in my efforts but once I switched their attitude completely changed. 

But when I brought it up, all they had to say was that it was my fault for taking their words so seriously and they were just trying to guide me into using my talents. 

Am I the asshole here? Did I really waste over three years of my life because I was too stubborn to see the truth and overreact? This has been on my mind for a while now. I just need to know."
391,afslk9,"WIBTA for telling a stranger her husband cheated on her repeatedly? Hey fellow assholes! Alt account; my friend might see this.

&#x200B;

About two years ago, my best friend told me his longtime girlfriend had confessed to cheating on him several times with a guy at work. I didn't ask too much about this other guy, but later found out from a mutual friend that the Other Man is married and the cursory Facebook sleuthing I had done to identify the guy was accurate. My BFF and his girl tried to work through it but eventually broke up, and nobody ever told the Other Man's wife about the dalliance. My BFF doesn't want to get involved and is just over the whole thing.

&#x200B;

(Based solely on social media, admittedly,) This guy's wife appears to be a TOTAL GODDAMN SWEETHEART. She has posted (not constantly/braggingly or annoyingly) some photos with her husband and seems 100% gaga over him. She is endlessly positive and adores her husband, who she's been with for over a decade. I don't know this woman and I don't have any particular emotional attachment to her situation (I'm female, married, never been cheated on to my knowledge), but my heart breaks for her.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: WIBTA for sending her an anonymous message advising her of her husband's long-ago affair? Asshole because I suspect it might be to absolve myself of guilt for knowing about it all this time. Asshole because maybe he just did it with this one person to get it out of his system (I suspect he & wife were high school sweethearts or something), and I don't want to potentially blow up their lives just to make myself feel better.

392,dkc159,"AITA for telling my family about my brother's ""tramp stamp""? I recently got a tattoo on my upper forearm, on the inner part right below my elbow. It's not an identical tattoo, or even a matching tattoo, but my fiance has a similar tattoo, and we got them around the same time. My parents do not know we're engaged, only that we're in a relationship and we live together, and we were going to tell them tonight at dinner. My brother and sister, who already know about the engagement, were also going to be at the dinner so it felt like a good time to do it considering they don't really like my fiance (he has other tattoos that they've seen and that is the sole reason they dislike him).

My brother, years ago (he's 30 now and he got it when he was in his early 20s), got a ""tramp stamp"", by which I mean he got a tattoo of the boy dog from *Lady and the Tramp* on his lower back. He thought it was funny at the time but once the hangover kicked in it was suddenly a lot less funny to him. I accidentally saw it a few years back and he begged me not to tell our parents because they hate tattoos more than anything and have said to all 3 of us kids, more than once, that if we got a tattoo that would be the final nail in the coffin for them, and have said that our grandparents would ""roll in their graves"". They said that the only way a tattoo could be worse was if it matched, because that was ""both ugly and stupid"".

I wore a white shirt to dinner which I guess was a little sheerer than I thought because at one point my brother loudly commented that me and Fiance must be sure about each other to get matching tattoos. My parents immediately asked me what that meant and I know as a grown woman who is financially independent and on track to getting married I should not have been scared to tell my parents I got a tattoo but I panicked. So when they started questioning me I said something like ""this coming from the guy with a tramp stamp"", which then set them off being mad at him. The louder reactions died down pretty quickly (we were in public) but they were angry at both of us for the rest of the meal, and they still don't know I'm engaged because of this.

I then got a message from my brother saying that was a ""dick move"" and my sister saying that ""yes, Bro was being a dick, but you didn't need to go to his level"".

AITA?

Everyone agrees on everything up to this point.

What is disputed is whether my needs are actually being dismissed, or whether I'm being unreasonable. I moved back home, as I said, and my room is in the basement. I'm taking summer classes online and will be commuting to school in the fall and spring to finish my degree - I'm a full-time student and also work 15-20 hrs/week (from home right now, although that may change depending on internship opportunities).

While I lived away, my younger brother (13) - we'll call him Winston - developed a game he calls ""QWA."" The game is throwing a yoga ball around the basement. He does this for hours. He broke several things that I left outside my room, has put holes in the walls, etc. but my family generally laughs it off like it's a totally normal thing to do. And I ignored it until I moved back home.

But now I'm back. And the first issue was that it's very upsetting to my cat, who lives with me. He's developed stress-related health issues and Winston locks him in my room for hours to play this game, and often forgets to open the door when he leaves.

The second issue is that, obviously, I am working in my room in the basement. I simply cannot work while he is throwing a yoga ball against my door, and I don't think I have to defend that.

My mother gets really upset with me when I suggest that Winston shouldn't be allowed to play this ""game"" now that I'm back. The only argument that holds any weight (imo) is that this is clearly a coping mechanism for dealing with his issues with my dad. What I would add here in my own defense is that when I was 13, I was being really, really abused - had developed an eating disorder, depression and anxiety - and she explicitly told me to just take it to ""protect my brothers."" So it's difficult for me to accept her argument that he should be allowed to do whatever he wants because my dad is sometimes mean or controlling to him. It's also relevant that I have repeatedly suggested other activities like basketball (we have a hoop) or tennis (we live near courts) which (a) would resolve this conflict and (b) probably would be better coping skills bc they are normal games and could be played with others in a healthy social environment.

Clearly I have a lot of resentment towards my mom, and clearly all of this is bogged down in decades of unhealthy dynamics. I just need people who aren't in it to tell me - am I being totally unreasonable and prying away a coping mechanism from my younger brother, OR is this a reasonable complaint to have in light of all the extenuating circumstances and possible solutions? In other words, AITA?"
394,cnt3s9,"AITA if I’m constantly arguing with my parents about how much money I give them So basically right when I started working I had to start giving my parents money to help around the house, I was ok with that no problem yet. As time starts to go by, they keep asking for more and more money and I give it to them. After a year of working I get laid off and tell them I won’t have any income for about a month while my time resets with the company I work for. The month of being laid off they say they need extra money so I give them $1, next month they are short again and need $1.2k. Finally my hours are reset and I’m good to go back to work and tell them I won’t be able to give them anything this month as I just gave you guys a lump sum of money the last 2 months let me recoup some and instantly my parents are getting anger with me because I need to help out blah blah blah. So I cough up another $1k and the following month they had basically emptied out my savings at this point (only been working for a year while giving them money each month and my own stuff to pay so never really had a chance to save) and they need more money. At this point I’m kinda fed up, I have my own car payment, phone, internet bill, and ect on top of whatever I give them for the month and tell them no. I need money for my own stuff and we get in a huge argument and still refuse to pay them for the month. I bring up how they have a car that’s roughly almost $3k a month and can BARLEY get by each month paying it and it just really gets intense at this point. Still won’t pay them, AITA reddit?"

She started crying and then I was forced to apologize to her for being mean to her. AITA?

We mostly use this chatroom to show each other memes and news. Recently, a coworker tagged me in a video making fun of my hairstyle and telling me to be less sensitive. This video included some homophobic views of masculinity. I replied to the video, ""Homophobic, but a good sentiment."" The coworker just replied with ""snowflake"". This prompted me to call him out for writing off homophobia as being overly sensitive. My brother stepped in to try and calm the situation by pointing out my ""boomer"" jokes and how those are directed at a people too. I didn't see this as an even argument and continued to argue this. My brother then purged the chat stating he didn't want toxicity in the chatroom.  I am not homosexual, but have very close friends who are.

397,cpnah8,"WIBTA if I quit my job after one month notice? I am a contractor and the contract ends in 6 months (the date's there in writing).  As a courtesy, I let my employers know 1 month in advance that I don't plan to renew the contract.  They emailed me back thanking me for the contribution.  There's still more than 2 weeks before my contract ends.

About a week ago, a co-worker wanted to talk about me rolling off the project.  That's how the conversation started.  She let me know in words that the project isn't going so well and that she knows it's not a fun project.  It was kind of left at that, but I think what was implied is she wants me to stay longer.  I'm not sure if she speaks for the owner, but she has a lot of sway at the company.  She's practically the most trusted advisor to the owners.  

As for me, I *really* don't want to stay.  In fact, every single night, I tell my GF, ""I hate my f__king job"" and I wish I didn't have to work tomorrow.  (She's a saint for putting up with me.)

The main reason is that the co-worker mentioned above is a huge asshole and I have to work closely with her.  She makes me feel stupid every time I interact with her and seems to take out her frustration with the project on me.  I have to interact with her a lot, and there's no way around that.  She's acknowledged publicly a couple of times that she's sorry she's been in such a bad mood (apologized to everyone, not me specifically), but the behavior hasn't changed.  This has made the experience almost unbearable to me.

The reason I took the job in the first place is I thought this female co-worker had a lot to teach me.  I made that detail clear to her before I started, but because the engagement has been going so poorly, she has not had time to teach me anything.  I empathize with her not having time. Whenever there is a learning opportunity, she makes me feel dumb for asking questions.  Half my energy is spent trying to figure out how to not look dumb when I say anything.  I feel like I'm leaving this job with a lot less confidence than I had going in.  I wish I never took it.

If this person was the nicest person in the world, I'd still want to leave.  I'd like to take a shot at becoming an entrepreneur. A week or month delay isn't going to ruin my chances, but that time would still be soul crushing.

If I left, would the project be screwed?  Hard to say.  I think it might be screwed with or without me. If I left, it'd definitely have a negative effect because it would take time to find and train my replacement.  But in my mind, it's not like that situation would be any different if I left a month or two later.  I'd bet the project still would be going poorly and it still wouldn't be fun.

The only reason I'm considering extending is because I'm worried about burning bridges.  It would be nice to be able to use the owners as references.  I think if I quit when the contract ends, she could convince the owners I'm not a team player and I f__ked the company over."
398,dbetld,"AITA for taking down a picture of my ex? Preface: My dads girlfriend has a history of sneakily talking to me about my ex-girlfriend that I dated for five years when my current girlfriend is in a different room. It’s very weird, she thinks I still want to talk about her, or it’s like fun to gossip when my girlfriend is only a few feet away and can obviously tell we’re talking about something when she enters the room we’re in. I tell my girlfriend about it later because she knows we were talking about something she didn’t like and I don’t want to hide anything. 

Anyway, I recently moved out of my dads house and into an apartment with previously mentioned girlfriend, which was immediately followed by my dad’s girlfriend moving in and putting a lot of her stuff in my old room, no biggie. A week or two later, me and my girlfriend go to my dad’s to visit. While my girlfriend is downstairs saying her hellos, I run up to my old room to see what it looks like now, and I’m greeted by an old prom picture of me, my dad and my ex-girlfriend wedged into the mirror on a dresser. I don’t think my dad would put it up, so I’m thinking my dads girlfriend did. Weird right? I know it would upset my girlfriend to see that when she comes up to see my old room, especially because of my dad’s girlfriend talking about my ex, so I simply just take it down and put in a drawer. I think maybe my dads girlfriend would understand why it was taken down. 

A week later I return to my dads house alone to use his printer, which is located in the room next to my old. I stop back in because I’ve lived there for 20 years and I’m still grasping the fact that I don’t live there anymore and bang, the picture is back up in the same spot. I think wtf man, this lady is super weird. It’s like she’s trying to still picture me, my dad and my ex girlfriend happily together. What I think is the strangest part, is that my dads girlfriend isn’t even in the picture! It was also before she was even around. Anyway, I get this weird feeling in my chest and I say fuck it, I’m just gonna throw it away. I take the picture, put it in my pocket and put it in the garbage. I don’t think twice about it. 

Apparently she noticed about the picture being missing again. My dad calls today, upset with me about the picture, claiming I shouldn’t have touched the picture because my dad’s girlfriend claims that her and my ex are still friends (she shops at the store my ex works at). I proceeded to tell him about how I think the picture is very strange and how my dads girlfriend always about my ex to me. Still upset that I touched the picture, he tells me he’ll talk to his girlfriend about talking about my ex in front of my girlfriend. 

AITA for removing the picture of me, my ex and my dad my dad’s girlfriend has displayed, strangely, on her mirror in my old room? It’s a picture that she’s not even in, or even knew my dad when the picture was taken."
399,c0xp8l,"AITA for refusing to wear a wig to my friend’s wedding? Just as a little background, I grew up in a very strict Christian family where I wasn’t allowed to cut my hair, ever, because “hair is a woman’s crown”. It was down to my knees by the time I escaped at 18. Ever since then I’ve either had a pixie, a buzz cut or have been totally bald, because I cannot stand the heavy feeling of long hair or all the brushing/washing/detangling after dealing with it for so many years. So that’s a big reason I’m so stubborn about this issue. Also, all of my friends involved in this story have always known me as the girl with no hair. Right now I’m bald because I always shave my head completely for the summer. 

One of my good friends is getting married in August and she chose me to be one of her bridesmaids. Everything had been cool, she’s always been the sweetest person and she showed no signs of going Bridezilla before this, until she called me up about three weeks ago and asked me if I could do her a favor and wear a wig to her wedding. She explained that she wanted all of her bridesmaids to match and that she wanted us all to look good in the pictures. I told her I really didn’t want to get a wig, and we’ve been on bad terms ever since.

All of our friends are on her side because “it’s just a wig” and “it’s not like she’s asking you to grow out your hair for the wedding, so she’s not the one being unreasonable.” And I know I can be very stubborn sometimes, which I guess is the reason I’m posting here. 

The thing is, I don’t know how many of you will be aware of this but a wig that will actually look good/realistic is expensive. I’ve already paid for a bridesmaid’s dress, new shoes, and plane tickets, as well as a small deposit for the person who’s going to do our makeup. This wedding has already cost me a fortune. I could afford a wig if I wanted to, but do I really want to spend the money on something I’ll never wear again when I’ve already spent a ton? Not really.

Also, this is going to be on a plantation in Louisiana. In August. I’m already going to be hot and uncomfortable, and a wig will make things a thousand times worse. 

My biggest reason-and this is why my friends are saying I’m the asshole-is the principle of the thing. I feel like it implies I look bad because I don’t have hair, which I personally don’t think is true. Is being bald so hideous I’ll ruin her pictures? Is she going to make her balding father wear a toupee? And I think the “I want us to match” thing is stupid. We’re already wearing matching dresses, why isn’t that enough? I know it’s “her day” and we’re supposed to make her happy, but isn’t there a line? 

I’ve offered to wear a cute headscarf as a compromise if my bald head is that offensive, but she’s not having it. I’m still in the bridal party and invited but I don’t know for how much longer, honestly. AITA for not wanting to wear a wig?

EDIT: Just to add two things: 1. She’s not willing to pay or reimburse me for the wig, in part or in full 2. Along with the headscarf I’d also be willing to grow my hair out into a pixie cut, the wedding is at the beginning of August so it’d still be really short though."

401,aw37cr,"AITA for this I will start off by saying that I suffer from depression and anxiety and paranoia, I mention this because it is important later, also sorry for the layout I'm on a phone.

About 2 and a half years ago I started college where I met my ex best friend and my ex bf, when I started I dated a guy in my class for about a month then he broke up with me and I didn't think much of it, a month later was when I started dating my ex bf and things where going really well, we did everything was going really well and I quickly fell in love with this guy, we spent alot of time together and took me on romantic dates and I thought he was perfect. 

My best friend, we also dud everything together, had lots of sleep overs, I organised birthday party's for her with things she loved doing ect, we even went to Italy together on holiday and she dated the first guy I mentioned that left me after a month.

Half way through our relationship my bf told me that he felt he shouldn't say this but wanted me to know that the other guy I dated had actually left me because he liked my best friend and because I have paranoia and anxiety I ended up getting worried that my bf would do the same so I asked him if he liked her, which he responded with only as a friend and I trusted them to not do anything. Which was a mistake.

Beginning on November last year, my bf out of the blue breaks up with me, which crushes me because a few weeks later would have been our anniversary and I had bought promise rings for us, I told my best friend while crying and she said she was sorry. Then I started to notice that my beat friend was starting to stop talking to me and that's when it clicked that my bf had also left me for her which was confirmed when I was invited to a party for new years, but it wasn't them that told me, it was one of my other friends who told me with my ex best friend in the room refusing to look at me. I was hurt and I said that I felt like I was stabbed in the back and betrayed because it was the second time and my friend got pissed off with me. That night I couldn't sleep because I was soo upset and the loneliness triggered my depression and I ended up cutting myself, I realised that I shouldn't have done that since I was at a friend's house but I wasn't thinking straight. Luckily it wasn't to bad but I still have scars. The next morning I broke down again because I was still very down and eventually got my dad to pick me up and take me home. After I got home was when I started getting messages telling me how I was in the wrong and how my ex best friend has done nothing wrong and that I was over reacting. I now have lost all my friends who I thought I could trust. Am I in the wrong?

Edit: I should mention that since this happened I have been going to therapy and seeing my doctor about my depression, thank you everyone that is concerned."
402,errpxw,"AITA for refusing to be friend’s guarantor So my friend has decided to get a loan to tide her over for a few months. She is having a lot of financial difficulties and feel it’s her only option which I understand. She has also decided to ask me if I would be a guarantor for said loan in case worst case scenario she defaults and I point blank refused. 

A few years ago I had stupidly taken out a phone contract in my name for my ex unaware of all the issues associated with it. He defaulted and I got a letter from bailiffs and had to pay £500. It has left a very bitter taste in my life and I’ve learnt my lesson and I have no plans on being that reckless again.

I told my friend that I was really sorry but I wasn’t comfortable being a guarantor due to past experience and also the fact I didn’t want to be responsible for someone else’s debt and that I didn’t have the financial means myself to do so. 

She got really angry and started crying saying i wasn’t being a good friend by helping her out and that I was selfish as I was letting her suffer just because I didn’t want to be her guarantor. She has other people she can ask like family so it’s not like someone wouldn’t say yes but she’s kicking off at me for refusing.

Update; thank you everyone who took the time to comment! I spoke to my friend again and once again explained my reasons for refusal and I hoped she would have realised it was wrong to ask me by now hit I was wrong. She again accused me of being selfish and I also learnt she had pulled this move on a few other friends we have and I’ve decided that it’s in my best interests to cut ties with her."

This morning I got up in bed with my gf because our son was awake and ready for breakfast (he's one.) I walked over to grab my sweats out of my closet and saw that my laundry basket had a bunch of clothes in it. In my usual morning confusion I asked if these were my clean clothes, to which my girlfriend replied that they were (she had taken them out of the dryer for me and put them there, which I do appreciate.) All I said was ""oh, these are my dirty clothes"" and proceeded to soet the clean ones out and separate them. She told my that I had ""low-key freaked out"" at her for putting my clean clothes there and proceeded to tell me off for being upset.

405,cunlba,"AITA for exploding on my father's wife Throwaway  

Hear me out on this one.

In regards to ages, I’m 17, Dad is 43, and father’s wife 27 or 28.

Six years ago, it came out during couple’s therapy that my father was cheating on my mom and that his mistress was pregnant. My mom initiated divorce. Six months after the divorce was finalized, my father married his now wife and they had three kids. My dad has apologized for his actions and we are still doing therapy, so one day I can truly forgive him.

I do not like my so-called stepmom, but in regards that she is father’s wife, I begrudgingly show respect. I have never called her out of her name until later in this story. If she speaks to me, I will say something back. If I am in her home, I will clean up after myself. However, I will always refer to her as my father’s wife and she will never be a prominent figure in my life. This is something she cannot accept.

I have never let my true feelings about her be known, until the other day. While at my father’ house, she attempted to make a cringe-worthy joke about my girlfriend with the saying “The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice,” and said that I was good enough looking boy and she was confused about why I would go out with a dark-skinned black girl and not someone white like myself. I guess the look on my face told her to shut up, so she changed the subject.

She then revealed that when my dad gets back from his TDY (Temporary Duty Assignment); she had booked a photoshoot for family portraits of us and she wanted to do a special photo of me and her two sons holding signs that say “Don’t mess with her,” with her 2-month-old daughter. I have never been in any of the previous family portraits because I refused to and my Dad said I didn’t have to.

I told her I was not going to participate

She asked why I was being difficult and that just she wanted family pictures with all of her children.

Six years’ worth of hurt came out. I told her she was a fool to ever think I was her child or that I considered her family. From my perspective, she was nothing, but my father’s racist side chick, who had nothing better to do, but chase after a married man and sit on her ass all day. I took it a step further and fully implied that her daughter wasn’t my father’s child because she looks nothing like him.

She turned red and started crying, saying how disrespectful I was and I had no right to talk to her in such a manner. I fully admit I called her a Bitch and stated she didn’t even deserve any respect from me because she didn’t respect my mother’s marriage and if she ever disrespected my girlfriend again, she would live to regret it. After realizing what I had said, I left and haven’t talked to her since.

Everyone that I have talked to say I should at least apologize for calling her a bitch and I don’t mind doing that.  However, certain people say I shouldn’t have gone off on her, because my dad was gone and she just had a baby, etc.

So who is the asshole?"

Not to get to into the details of the affair but he had a long term affair with a coworker who was his subordinate, never apologized to my friend, decided to walk out on her and the kid, manipulated her extensively, etc. To be fair to him the marriage had not been great. That's about as fair to him as I can be because I can't bring myself to think that's an excuse. My friend has been devastated and has been forced to become a single mother because he wanted little to do with her and their kid. She keeps hoping that, even though he treated her like shit (told her he hated her) that he will come back. I never thought he would come back but recently he has been showing interest in coming back (probably because his girlfriend left him). He's still not apologized. If they were to get back together WIBTA for telling her that I love and support her but that I won't be around him or let him be around my family?

407,aa5iny,"AITA for calling the cops on my friend when I thought they were in danger, and then being angry at her after I found out she was okay? Before I went to bed on Christmas night, I was added to a group chat with 3 other people (all men) by my friend (who is also a woman). She messaged us and said, ""If I don't get back to you guys at midnight, call the police."" She then left an address in the chat.

I was very confused and was asked what was going on. One of the guys in the group tells us that she was messaging some guy on Tinder and decided to go over his house. Weird that she's asking us to do this on Christmas night of all nights, but I get it, she doesn't celebrate it. My other girlfriends and I ask each other to watch out for each other when we've gone on tinder dates in the past but we've never had to call the police before.

15 minutes past midnight we all call and text her and get no response. The guys insist that she was probably okay and we don't need to call the cops. I get really frustrated by this, thinking that they don't understand that women do this stuff all the time (asking each other if they make it home okay after a night out/on a date, and have plans to call the police if they don't get back). I tell them that if she asked us to call the police if she doesn't get back to us, then we should. I volunteer myself to call the police as a result.

I call the non-emergency line to the police and let them know what happened. Right as they were about to send people over, she texts us that she's okay. I apologize to the police and tell them she's alright. 

TURNS OUT SHE SIMPLY FORGOT TO GET BACK TO US. But she also said she didn't get our calls (which I'm pretty sure is a lie, because I was able to connect to her voicemail and have a log of the call going through to it).  She ended up going over to the guy's house and just cuddled with him and lost track of time. Her exact words were ""Oh God. It's 12:20. Thank you and sorry."" I am livid. I tell her she wasted my time and kept me up (she also kept my boyfriend up and we had an early flight to catch), and left the chat.

I am so fed up at this point. There has been a bunch of things she's done in the past where use uses me as an emotional crutch or has forced me to be the ""responsible friend."" This is basically the final straw and I decided that it wasn't even worth confronting her about this any further. She's been posting on social media and talking to all our mutual friends as if nothing has happened at all, which makes me even more upset.

I am worried I am being unfair/overreacting too much by deciding to just cut her out as a friend, so that's why I'm here.

So my birthday is tomorrow and I’m inviting some friends tomorrow to play smash ultimate. I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who’s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don’t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I’m not against him staying the night I just don’t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don’t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  

Am I the a hole??

Edit: I didn’t expect this to blow up like this . 
Anyway here’s some answers to some questions.

I’m 14 turning 15 

My mom says I’ve seen this kid before, but I feel like it’s in the sense of that Aunty that changed your diaper when you were 1 year old that you don’t remember.

I asked my mom if we’re cousins that I maybe didn’t know about . She said no.

Apparently my mom gives my old clothes to him . 

I don’t think I’ll stand up to my parents. Maybe if I were older and had something to fall back on.

My dad said the kid is staying because his mom wants to go to church and they live really far so it’s just easier to stay the night.

This isn’t the first time they pulled something and didn’t tell me. Around Christmas time my mom signed me up for volunteering at a Christmas play and she didn’t mention it until we got in the car.  We were there for 5 minutes and they didn’t mention we were doing this as a family. The Christmas play was late night and really long so it wasn’t what I wanted to do on my Saturday night. I guess they realized they were in the wrong and didn’t make me go.



Edit 2:  Hey guys I’m back . I’m gonna tell you about my birthday party. So of the 5 people I invited only 1 came and the 10 year old. We had a good time laughing and stuff and I’m pretty friendly with the 10 year old now. The friend left around 15 minutes and we’re just here watching  American idol.

She said she was going to be gone for three days and I saw her last on Friday. We hung out and she had all her bags with her. She told me that she told her parents that she was gone camping with me which is the first red flag of this story. She also said that I was the only person she told she was going on a trip to and the tplaced all the responsibility on me. 

We both live in the same neighbourhood about five minutes from each other and this lie didn’t even make sense. Before I could say anything else she left as her boyfriend picked her up. 

Three days later and I haven’t heard from her at all and I was getting worried. She promised she would tell me when she got there but nada. She was off all social media and my texts weren’t going through and I couldn’t contact any of her friends since she refused to let me meet them too. I may be salty. 

I started getting anxious as I kept thinking she might’ve been murdered or had an accident so I went to her brother first and told her what was going on and then we both spoke to their parents. Her mom went into hysterics and we immediately went to the police department to file a report. 

The officer working with us was encouraging me to try and hack her social media to find information as well as find the social media of her boyfriend. Eventually they were able to reach her boyfriend and it turns out she flew to Cuba and didn’t consider the consequences of her lies. 

She said I broke her trust and that I ruined our friendship because I was worried about her. AITA?

We’re all adults btw. I realize she can do whatever the hell she wants but it was unfair to me and I feel like I did the right thing. I miss her so much but she treated me so poorly. Am I just too clingy or should I have just not gotten involved? Smh 

Edit*
Best friend and I are both 20, her boyfriend is 25+ 

The police actually told me to keep trying her social media. It was how we found out she left the country and the name of her bf and pictures of him. She was boutta be on the news. "

this happend a while ago but i remembered it and cringed. 

I have a twin sister who is the complete opposite of me, it has caused some issues growing up as joined birthdays always failed because I hated princess and she hated pirates. 

it came up to our 16th birthday and we both got Taylor swift tickets, here is the issue I hate Taylor swift and my family knows that, I would always complain about how annoying she is. the only reason I got the ticket was because my sister is the biggest Taylor fan and mum wanted us to go together, mum did not care that I disliked the gift as she wanted to force me to go. 
it was also the only gift i got (I'm not complaining just mentioning)

I told mum (after the party had ended) that I really dislike Taylor swift and would rather not go but I would love to give my ticket to one of my sisters friends so my sister can enjoy it with someone who likes Taylor swift. 

mum got mad and called me ungrateful and told me that I should accept my gifts, I was forced to go, I had a horrible time and my sister was angry that mum made me go as she knows I hate Taylor swift. she wanted to take a friend with her, and I would of given my ticket if I was allowed. 

I tried to like the consert but I could not sing along to songs I hate.

Her family is basically my second family. She has a twin sister getting married in a month. It’s a destination wedding and I already booked the flights and what not. It also happens to be the day after my stepmother’s 60th birthday. However, as it’s a destination wedding, I plan to be there with my GF and her family a few days before.

My stepmother married my dad a couple of years after my mom died. So she’s been my stepmom for like 18 years. I have an alright relationship with her, not overly close.

Anyways, my dad yesterday said he’s starting to plan for her 60th birthday party. I told him I wouldn’t be able to make it because of the wedding. He then got mad and said it feels like I care more about my girlfriend’s family than my “actual family”. I told him that I consider her family to be my second family. He said that was “foolish” and that I should let my stepmother know personally that I can’t make it for her birthday dinner and that she’ll be very sad. 

Am I the asshole? Birthdays come every year, and yes, 60 is a big milestone, but my GF’s sister only gets married once (hopefully)."
412,ci7oc6,"AITA for refusing to call my brother to wish him a safe trip? I'm 26 and my brother is six years younger than me. We never got along very well growing up and our relationship was further strained when he left for college in a far away state two years ago. He is entitled and frequently blames my parents for all of his mistakes despite the fact that he is independent and living in another state. He has no hobbies, spends most of his evenings and weekends inside playing video games. But what bugs me more than anything else is his ill spirited demeanor towards my mother and his girlfriend.

Since he's been back home this summer, he has his girlfriend over nearly every week and through closed doors I can hear them playing video games as he yells at her.

\*in the game\* ""Why the fuck would you do that?!"" ""Pay attention!"" ""Don't fucking go there!""

It's disturbing, they keep me up at night, and when I have people over it makes me uncomfortable because I kinda have to explain to my friends that they're in an abusive relationship.

Today the two of them are leaving for an overseas trip and my mother texts me ""Hey, your brother is leaving for Poland later today, give him a call and wish him a safe trip since you won't get to see him.""

He moved away when we were in the 4th grade and I rarely spoke to him after. Fast forward 9-10 years I'm 18 now and life has been great.  

So essentially he pops up out of no where in the same neighborhood we used to live in.  I still live here and he wants to see me.  I already made plans that day so I wasn't really in the mood to go but I did anyways. 

So I see him and he  gives me a hug kinda and says how much he missed me.  Which coming from a guy made me feel uncomfortable just because I don't say ""I miss you or I missed you"" .  I quickly get over that and invite to see my parents out of kindness.  So I just spend time with him catching up by walking around the block and talking which was the first thing that offset me.  

1. He used the n-word..I'm black, he's not.  Pretty straight forward. Some black ppl are cool with it.  I'm not one of them.  Dumb to assume everyone is.
2. Asked if my gf was ""proper"".  I don't like being questioned about who I'm in a relationship with by anyone apart from my family

So I go to my originally planned day and leave him and I don't really have intentions of speaking with him. I have him my socials out of kindness and not upsetting him. ( This was before he said all the wierd stuff).  

He returns a week later and we're playing basketball.  We play 1v1.  Just out of kindness again. Not wanting to hurt his feelings. I train for basketball so I'm relatively good. I'm just taking jumpshots and making them btw because it's 30 degrees out and I don't want to sweat profusely.  I guess he started trash talking and started calling me a p***y and a f****t for always shooting.  I'm generally cool with ppl talking trash, but it wasn't really about the game he was really just insulting me.  I just didn't want that at the time but I let it slide. He kept asking to hang out but I kept putting it off saying I'm busy.

He really holds on to our childhood and thinks that I'm that same kid but I'm not anymore. I'm more reclusive and I enjoy my alone time more.  He even makes false events in his head that certainly didn't happen when we were kids.  I'm sure he's nice but I don't see it to hang out with him.  I'm not holding grudges but I just don't want to."
414,dj09hb,"AITA for ensuring my lease is upheld? I've talked to some people and they're torn. Some say I should push for my lease and rights, others tell me to drop it because there are more of them and I'm the odd one out and they are doing it to be spiteful.

Background:

I moved into a 4 bedroom appt with 5 friends. 4 females and a boyfriend. The problem is that this is a female-only appt with single occupancy rooms and with animals in our bedroom. All of this is on the lease. This is student housing and we rent by the room not the appt so the common area isn't the same as it would be for a normal apartment. Anyway, I'm currently paying $250 more than anywhere else to ensure this and I'm not getting it. I've been looking to sublease but it's hard since I also have a cat (why we were paired since it's an animal friendly appt)

The thing I could put up with the bf except that I'm right next to the bf/gf room. They get home at midnight and I can hear them talking/banging the walls/moving furniture and/or having sex almost every night. This has been keeping me up and has messed with my schedule. I like to go to bed around 10 and up by 6 but I've been kept up until 1-2 am and am sleeping through my classes.

&#x200B;

Story:

Tonight a roommate asked me to turn my music off (volume 2, door closed, no bass) at 9:30. This is after they were all yelling and hanging out in the living room from 7-9pm. As she was talking to me I could hear bf/gf talking and moving furniture and banging the walls beside me. I told her that I only have it on because I can't sleep either and that [gf/bf](https://gf.bf) are loud constantly. I told her that by letting bf live there and them being so loud after I talked to them about both those issues several times (most recent was last night) is not ok. I then explained for the 5-6th time that I signed a very specific lease, that I choose to pay more for that lease, that I live here too and that ignoring the lease is a giant F-you to me.  I then also told her that the cat needs to be in gf's room because at that moment their cat came up to my open door and I had two cats hissing at each other across my feet. This is extremely frustrating because I've told gf a million times that their cat can't be out and I told her twice yesterday. Her cat spends it's day just outside my door hissing at my cat and pawing under the door terrorizing it. They also start hissing and swiping at each other when I open the door so I can't get in or out of my bedroom.

&#x200B;

Anyway, AITA? I'm aware that I've made my appt very, very tense but I'm ok with that if I can get the lease upheld.  I can't leave until I find a sublease but that might not be possible until May.  My next step was to talk to gf one last time about bf and cat before going to the management. That's what people are torn about but from my pov all I did was be the odd one out and expect my lease to be upheld."
415,c3luoe,"AITA For uninviting a girl to the school ball As a bit of backstory, our highschool is pretty well known in our country, but despite having some of the top academic scores in the country for several years running, our students have been up to too much mischief, and our school ball gets axed for a few years running as a result. This year is the first in a while in which the school actually sponsors the event, meaning the police won't crash it after 30 mins of it starting. As a result, I'm able to go.

Backtrack to about 2 weeks back or so. Ball tickets on sale, and the event's in a month, so on the back of people's minds. I go to an arts performance tournament, if you will, where I can perform my thing with my group, but also get to meet people (read: girls. Unisex schools are fun) from other schools. A small group rocks up to play a game of cards, get their names, yadda yadda, and two of them friend me on fb. Not long after, one of them asks if I'm going to the ball, hadn't bought tickets by then, but was considering, and she asked if I were willing to take her friend. Now, I'm not the most socially clued in kid by any stretch, certainly not the partygoer type, but I know myself to be at least conventionally attractive on a good day. Given that the previous two years a girl's gotten a crush on me at these events, I assume the same for this one, too. As a result, I said yes, but would like to get to know her first. 

Starting the conversation with the girl who wants to go with me, I discover that she really just wants to +1 so she can hang out with friends, though clued in that she wanted to go to pre ball things with me. On discovering this, I declined to take her, despite having said yes previously, citing my reasoning that I thought she was interested in me, and not my position in being able to go to the ball. 

If it matters, we're all around the 16-18 age range, and apparently the first friend was ""super annoyed"" with the second friend as well.

So, AITA for uninviting this girl after already having said I'd take her?"
416,a4b98h,"AITA for bringing up the ""Baby it's Cold Outside"" controversy with my girlfriend? Context: We have been together four years, and love each other very much. She struggles with complex PTSD in relation to her upbringing, as well as past relationships. Especially one where she was raped and had an abortion.

Last night I asked if she had heard of the controversy surrounding the song and how it had been pulled from the radio, just making small talk. I was expecting small talk and got an earful. Her stance is fully in line with #MeToo, and if I thought for a minute I probably wouldn't have brought it up. 

I attempted (poorly) to relate why I personally thought the removal of the song was excessive and set a bad precident for artists past and present. I tend to look at a much broader picture and enjoy reading about the history of songs and looking into their meaning. I didn't do any of that before I stepped on that particular landmine.

I didn't want to trivialize her views, but I still wanted her to understand why I felt the way I did. Without any evidence beside my gut and a cursory read of an opinion piece over at the CBC.

Needless to say, I slept on the couch. 
I woke up to another shouting match, and having read into more of the history and circumstances around the writing and original (pre Neptune's Daughter) thought it would be a great idea to try again to offer my point of view, back with further knowledge on the subject. You know, instead of just backing down and waiting until shit blows over to apologize for being insensitive. 

I feel like I ruined our Friday night, possibly our whole weekend. As if I needed another reason to hate Christmas music.

Edit:
Further clarification added at the suggestion of u/Imsotiredomg.

>Maybe I could have been clearer with my line about waking up to another shouting match. She started yelling at me while. I was still half asleep on the couch, she brought it up again. But yeah, I was an idiot for playing into it thinking I could make the situation better with the same shit that didn't work the night before. "
417,bzkmn1,"aita for not clapping or standing for a military reunion?  

At an award ceremony for my middle schoolers for things like grades, perfect attendance, orchestra, sports. This school is in a city just outside a large Army base. The school is made up of probably 50/50 civilian/military kids. This is a huge Army base. In addition to Army, we have a very small number Navy and Air Force here as well. I myself am military (19 years Army).

The awards ceremony was going well, kids were being called up, pictures taken, people clapping. There was commotion backstage, curtains moving, and some confusion on the stage itself. The ceremony paused and then another kids name was called. This particular kid was called onstage, and instead of the principal handing him his award, an Air Force Captain handed him his award. The kid and this captain hugged and it was announced that, his dad had returned from a 6 month deployment a few weeks early, so that he could surprise his kid at this ceremony. This dad then grabbed his sons hand, held it up like a prize fighter and ref in a boxing match win. Lots of cheering from the crowd, standing ovation. After a pause, the other kids just got their name called and kept the line moving, lots of kids, little time. Not me though, I didn't stand or clap. After the ceremony, this particular Captain stood with his son by the auditorium exit doors talking to his family. He stood close enough to the doors that he would be noticed and congratulated and thanked by just about everyone passing by, but far enough away from the door that he didn't look like he was waiting for it. My wife congratulated him, thanked him for his service and scorned at me when I declined to do the same.

In the I was asked why I didn't shake his hand and congratulate him and his son. My answer was:

We have been deployed multiple times since 2001, it's not a big deal anymore.

I can't watch CNN or Fox news or any other news source without seeing some dad or mom jumping out of a box at their kids school or throwing a baseball out at their sons little league game or some ridiculous ""look at me stunt"" trying to get attention and I am sick and tired of it.

It was a 6 month deployment, AND it ended early for them.

There were over 100 kids at this event, each with their own story, why feel the need to steal their thunder.

These reunions aren't about the kid, it the service member making it about themselves.

There is no draft, it's a job, he volunteered, got paid, knew what he was getting into, it was less than 6 months, and came home uninjured. No different than any other job out there.

My wife has deemed me an asshole, she won't argue with any of my points in particular, but has deemed me an asshole in general over this. She says her friends and coworkers agree with her, but I think she is just saying that, doubt she asked them. I returned with ""I guarantee everyone at my work would agree with me""

Well my work just called me and said I was scheduled today (Monday), Wednesday and Friday of this week. I told them I can't go in and they sounded upset at me. 

Something else to note is that I very well COULD have gone in today, since I was technically scheduled after school.

Eventually, she and her husband moved into a new house and gave it to my wife and I for free since they were upgrading and would otherwise have just gotten rid of it. 

We had it for a few years ourselves until we eventually upgraded. After asking around if any family members wanted it, we decided to sell it online. SIL saw a posting on fb marketplace and stirred up a minor drama over it. According to her and MIL, it is weird for us to sell it after having gotten it for free. I guess it would have been ok if we had just taken it to the dump or given it to Goodwill?

Monday night I was on a walk with a new-ish friend. She is a older than me by a little, in her early 40s. We were speaking of my recent recovery from a long term illness, and she was saying how it's good that I am healthier now because I'll be wanting to have kids with my SO soon - ""maybe two!"".

I replied ""Hmm, nah, I wont be having children"" trying to keep it casual and move the conversation on. But she pressed the issue. 

I can't remember verbatim how it went *exactly*, but she would keep arguing whenever I would say ""No, I wont be having kids"" after that. i.e saying ""Oh you MIGHT do"". I'd reply ""No I wont be having kids!"". She would press more, ""but it might happen?"". Again, I'd say no. She'd say ""But you and (boyfriend) have been together quite a while now, you talk of marriage, you might be having them soon!"" etc.

And honestly I got super annoyed. I couldn't believe that at 30, someone was arguing with me about this. I am an adult and know my own mind on this. I was also SLIGHTLY annoyed that she related the benefits of me getting better from a serious illness to me now being 'healthy to have kids' rather than, you know, it being a good thing that I am healthier for myself. Like somehow my purpose in life is to have babies. But that was probably be looking too much into it I guess... Anyway.

I didn't even think about it at all before I said it... but I was so annoyed I blurted out ""I wont be having kids because I can't have them!""

She went quiet instantly and went ""Huh?"" and I panicked and said ""Yeah I can't have kids, I have dodgy plumbing, nothing works in there"" and she went ""Oh right"" and went completely quiet, before we changed the topic.

I was relieved that she wasn't going on about it anymore. However, since then, I have felt guilty for lying about something that's quite serious and very sad for a lot of women who can't have kids, but want them. At the same time, I really like how it got her off my back...

One of my (supportive) friends pointed out that I am getting to the age where I am likely to be prodded about it *more* nearing 40, rather than less like I thought I would be, and that thought is really exasperating... and even as guilty as I feel for lying to my friend about the integrity of my 'plumbing', I can't deny it worked a treat to get her off my damn back.

It's a working man's job and could easily be considered a prime example of the place where you would find ""locker room talk"". The guys tend to give each other nicknames and call each other different things, often light-hearted, without any bad intention. We all really seem to appreciate each other there and if there's a problem for some reason, it's public.

When I was pretty new to the job, my co-workers found out pretty early on I was largely an introverted person. I think this has changed a bit, but this make me stand out a lot in the group. 

At one point, my co-workers were calling me the ""school shooter"" for reasons I could only discern as me being introverted. I'm well past high school age and I didn't even stay in college, and I'd never had the intentions to be a shooter. It was certainly a weird nickname for them to give me, but I never did find the reason behind it.

One day, we were outside in front of customers, and my co-workers were ragging on me as they sometimes do. They were calling me the ""school shooter"" in front of complete strangers. I really didn't like that, and I already didn't like the nickname at all.

After we got back inside to our 'office' I began telling the guys how I felt about the nickname and I told them, not asked, to stop calling me that. A couple were a bit taken back, with one of them just leaving the room entirely. In my mind, I think I was justifiably mad about the nickname and the incident. After all, who wants to be called a school shooter?! It just seems so horrible in my mind.

423,dxc9zm,"AITA for not wanting to be my best friends carer? A couple of years ago, my best friend from middle school was in a bad traffic accident. He was in a coma for months and the accident resulted in some brain damage. He suffered memory loss and became very childlike, having to spend months learning to read, write, talk and walk again.

We were best friends in middle school but grew apart during high school due to different classes. We pretty much lost contact when we went off to different colleges.

All his old friends and classmates cut contact with him after his accident and his girlfriend ended up leaving too. Even though I hadn't seen him for well over a year at the time of his accident, his family personally asked for me to visit and obviously I cared about my old friend. I traveled back to our hometown once a week to visit him while he was in hospital and continued for about half a year after he went back home. 

Now I'm half way through my final year of college now and the workload is awful. Every day I'm either in class, doing assesments or working, I hardly have time for myself, never mind hanging out with friends. That being said, a bunch of our high school friends decided to have a joint birthday/reunion and they planned it enough in advance for me to make time to go since I want a chance to relax and catch up with everyone.

Someone suggested we invite our friend since no one else had seen him since the accident. The issue is he would need me to be his carer for the evening (I've had to sign things and have briefings with his mom before we go out), which would mean me going to pick him up, making sure he can take time to rest, making sure he doesn't talk to strangers, taking him home before 9pm and definitely not drinking. I said I didn't want him to invite him because I wanted to be able to relax and drink, not essentially babysitting him. They called me an asshole for only thinking about myself.

They've all had at least two years to arrange something to go visit him or plan something we could all do together. Hell they don't even message him so why am I the asshole? But my parents and girlfriend agree saying I should think about my friends feelings and how lonely he's been since the accident. 

Am I the asshole?"
424,a17tmp,"AITA for breaking up with my girlfriend at her birthday party Using a throwaway and changing some details because she is a redditor. In the title I say girlfriend but we never had the conversations that defined what our relationship was. I had been seeing this girl for about 3 months, the last month and a half we have been spending almost every day together, she would stay at my house or I would stay at her house 3-4 days a week, so I had just assumed that we were exclusive and that the conversation defining our relationship was soon to come.
	
Her birthday was a week ago and she was having a birthday party that weekend to celebrate it. She asked me to come over and help make some food for the party, so I arrived at her house a few hours before the party had started. I had just assumed I would be spending the night over there since we hadn’t seen that much of each other (besides on her birthday we went out to dinner and had a great time) that week because of the holidays, so I brought a bag with a change of clothes and a toothbrush, ect.  So I helped her set up for the party and her friends and co-workers start to arrive. This was my first time meeting a lot of her friends and the night was going really good. It was a small party maybe 10-15 people, her friends all seemed really cool. The whole night she had been giving me a lot of attention (sitting on my lap, holding my hand, taking me aside to kiss) until her co-worker “bob” showed up. As soon as he walked in the door she got really excited ran over to him and gave him a big hug. After this point she began to completely ignore me and was pretty much hanging off of “bob”. She had introduced me to all her friends before bob had arrived but after he arrived she was just all over him.
	
I try not to get jealous, but watching this person who I care about flirting with someone else can really get to you. after about an hour of her ignoring me and flirting with this other guy I was starting to get angry, so I stepped outside to have a smoke. From the front porch you can see into the living room and I watched her and bob go over to the couch and she sat in his lap and began to kiss him. At this point I was pretty drunk and very angry, so I called an uber went inside to grab my back pack and as I was at the front door she came over to me and asked were I was going and I yelled at her “I’M FUCKING DONE WITH YOU, GO BACK TO  BOB!” and went home.
	

That night I received a bunch of calls and texts from her calling me an asshole and that I ruined her birthday party, I didn’t respond to her. The next morning I called her and told her I was going to come over and get my car if she wanted to talk. When I got there we talked and she said that she didn’t feel like she did anything wrong because we had never talked about being exclusive and that I was overreacting. I pretty much told her that I guess it was my mistake for assuming we were exclusive but what she did was still fucked up and that we are still over. This past week I have been receiving messages from her and her roommate calling me a piece of shit for ruining her birthday party, and that I am over reacting. Maybe I shouldn’t have yelled at her in front of people but I feel that making out with someone in front of the person you are dating is an asshole move.

Also, my girlfriend is the sweetest girl, cooks and cleans, works two jobs and doesn't ask for anything crazy on any holiday except my company.

So over Christmas we had a party, family was there and obviously my girlfriend was there. Afterwards, I leave to drop her off at home and go back home, he tells me ""why did you bring that trash over, you're ruining your life that I built up for you, you're the worst investment of my life."" I fucking had it after that. Didn't say anything. Just haven't spoken to him since. For those that may say I should try talking to him, I have, and he just doesn't care to listen.

Now. My mom and sister think I'm a dick for ignoring him and I should mend the fences with him. I told them I would if he agrees to stop badgering me and being unkind to my girlfriend.

Extra info: I live at home becusse I'm finishing up medical school right now and the hospital I'm at is 10 minutes from my house so saving money is a huge plus. So cirretnyl moving out isn't an option for another year. 

So reddit, AITA here?"
426,epkktk,"AITA for not letting an autistic guy be near my friend? Hi so this is my first post on reddit so I’m bound to do something wrong so I apologize in advance BUT anyways
Me (F18) and my friend M (F18) have been friends for 4 years. She’s from Japan and has always been uncomfortable with how touchy Americans are (stuff like hugging someone you just met, handshakes, teachers touching her shoulder in class ect).  When we first started being friends in hs I would just hold her pinky because that was what she was comfortable with, but I avoided hugging her unless she initiated it. She’s a super passive person and will not step up and tell someone to stop doing something that makes her uncomfortable so over the years I’ve been kinda....cockblocking a lot of weird boys for her (stuff like pulling her away from a conversation).

This semester me and M took an art class together and we are super excited about it. However on the first day as we were introducing ourselves, a guy (maybe our age?) leaned over and said “you’re pretty brave, I have autism too and have a hard time talking like that”..............she doesn’t have autism...she just has a small voice.

Day 2. The guy sits next to her while we’re working on our pieces. He would not stop talking to her. She had to stop what she was doing and actually face him to hear what he was saying, which slowed down her work flow. He was asking her questions like “Do you have any dark secrets?” “So you have Chinese eyes?” (She was pissed after that one) and kept talking about dead pets, furries, and his parents marriage. To top it off, he kept hugging her. She needed to step out of class bc of it and he followed her to the door. 

So here’s where the asshole part is.
Day 3: me and M talk about the situation. She’s unbearably uncomfortable around this guy. So we decide to switch seats. I get there early, set up my work space in her old seat, and begin the barricade her spot with a wall, some carts, her chair, and a few other students. Immediately the guy starts crying. I try to ignore it and wait for M to show up. He doesn’t do any of the assignments all class and leaves early.

We both feel super bad about this. I know people with autism have a lot of trouble making friends and talking about their problems and I probably just smacked away his only source of venting and such. But my friend isn’t necessarily the best person suited for his situation. Coming from both a trauma background and a different culture, M just isn’t comfortable with what he did. 

So AITA for blocking an autistic guy from talking to my friend?

EDIT: Ok one more time since i still dont know how reddit works lol!
More context:
-we are first year college students

-M doesnt have autism (diagnosed or not) shes just super kind and shy and couldnt hurt a fly, even if that fly publicly harassed her and called her derogatory names (bc thats happened). She says being from japan has A LOT to do with how she acts and what she finds uncomfortable.
-I agree i baby M a little bit, but not to the point where i friggin shelter her or something. In my opinion, when I step up and help her out, its me just doing what a friend is expected to do. It just gets frustrating to watch her get upset about something and do nothing! She doesnt need therapy, shes just really nice lol.

-We talked to the professor after day 2. M didnt say anything about the unwanted contact or racist comments. She just said he kept both of them from being productive in class. Prof taught classes for special ED adults and we knew this, so we knew she would help. Prof agreed with us trying to distance ourselves since on day 4 she encouraged him to sit at a table rather than an easel (which makes sense for the project we were working on). We did a small group assignment and prof tried to put him in a separate group from us, but he begged her to let him join us (we did but M was very uncomfortable and hid in the bathroom most of the time) But prof is keeping an eye on the situation.

-At the time I think switching seats and pulling up a cart was the best solution for us. It wasnt out of the blue or anything, I got to class a few minutes earlier than M the next day and sat in her spot. She pulled a cart behind her because he kept standing behind her and talking into her ear on day 2. I figured what we did was the most non confrontational and more.........unstaged? I thought it just looked like ""lalalalala i think ill sit here today!"" since we dont have assigned seats or anything. 

-M does have a history of specifically sexual abuse. She cant say no to anyone.

-Last class he stood behind her for 10 minutes so he could hug her and say goodbye. She tried to ignore him but he moved the cart and tried hugging her, but she didn't move. She just said bye. So i guess thats an improvement for M, lol.

Once again thanks for all the input. I do feel really bad for him but M is my friend and I want to help her as much as i can."
427,cc0ivq,"AITA for Lying to HR, Enforcing Double-Standards on a Single Employee, and Trying to Get Her Fired? EDIT: I made it quite clear to 'Karen' that as long as her work is being done, 'I see nothing, hear nothing' when she confronted me about my supposed snooping. I am highlighting the relevant portion from my original post since people either seem to not see it, or misunderstand it.

EDIT 2: I am absolutely **horrified** that so many people in this subreddit think that I, the supervisor, can **explicitly** tell my employees that they can just mess around on the internet while at work. **What country do you live in that allows this to be spelled out by management?** It's all nods and winks because I can't just tell people they can come to work and goof off.

I'm a supervisor and I'm pretty laid back. For my department, if you don't notice anything's wrong, then we're doing our job right. There's quite a bit of downtime and I don't mind my people going on social media, Reddit, YouTube (wearing headphones), or even planning their vacations on work computers **as long as their work is getting done.**

Enter: Karen. New hire, late-20s, is new to the job but learns fast and seems to know what she's doing. The older employees know I don't care if I'm walking by and I see someone surfing the web or watching videos. Karen's new so she automatically 'Windows Key'+M (shortcut to minimize all active windows) everytime I walk by and I chuckle but otherwise say nothing else. Since her desk is near the center of the office, I walk by quite frequently. After several times being 'caught' browsing sites, she minimizes everything and turns to me and asks if everything is alright. I say 'Yeah' and Karen's co-worker giggles.

**She takes it the wrong way and says she doesn't enjoy being spied on and that if I had a problem I should just say it. I'm stunned speechless for a few seconds and then I tell her that as long as her work is being done, I see nothing, hear nothing.**

Over the next few weeks, since walking around her area is unavoidable, I end up reinforcing the impression that I'm still 'snooping' on her. She gets so upset that she takes it up with HR. I get dragged in and when they ask me if I 'snoop' on her I say I'm not snooping on anyone at all. Karen says I'm lying since I'm always 'trying to catch her in the act' while leaving everyone else alone. To stop her from throwing everyone else under the bus, **I straight-up lie and say nobody is doing anything inappropriate.** HR wanted proof, I refused to spy on my employees for this purpose, and since Karen had nothing concrete, HR closed the meeting to 'deliberate further'.

After the meeting was over, word gets out (not from me) that Karen tried to screw everyone over and the entire department becomes a hostile workplace, with people being paranoid now of being watched. Karen goes around trying to catch people surfing non-work-related sites which just further fuels the paranoia. So now I'm angry at her for disturbing the peace so I actually 'snoop' on her to catch her in the act, documenting each time she was doing inappropriate browsing, which is the height of hypocrisy given what she accuses other people of doing. **I don't do this to anyone else, hence the 'double-standards'.**

When HR contacts me later for more details, I happily give them what I documented on Karen and tell them of her inappropriate use of workplace resources. I tell them I haven't documented anyone else doing anything inappropriate (partially true). **This is the 'trying to get her fired' part.** Everyone hates her and it's making it very hard for her to do her job so now she's basically dead weight."
428,cycpyf,"WIBTA if I ( 22F ) reprimanded a girl ( 20F ) my mum ( 48F ) took in? A few months ago, my mum took in a girl ( J ) that'd been evicted and had no where else to go.  My brother and I weren't happy about it because it was meant to be a short-term solution ( free room and board with the promise that'd she be looking for a place to stay ), but it became apparent to us that J hadn't been looking for places to live.  It's been at least four to five months now, it was meant to be four weeks.

Over time, we've received complaints from our guests about the J's poor hygiene and disrespect towards our home. Instances like leaving shed hair all over the bathroom, using our things ( my brother's protein shaker, my shoes ), and breaking a faucet in our kitchen. My mum confessed to me that she's very upset, but can't kick her out because instead of finding a place to live or paying my mom rent?  This girl *borrowed* money from her and my mum's afraid she'll never get it back if she asks her to leave. I've put my head down and abided; it's my mother's home that she built and paid off. 

My mum's en route to Dubai. Before leaving, she told me that while she's gone? I'm the caretaker of the home: I'm to collect rent, pay the bills, and clean. It's not been a full day since my mum left the country yet and I'd been awake all night because I'm trying to meet a deadline, only to notice J snuck in two male friends and a female friend. They were all sitting in her bed in the guest room, door open, while I was in the living room. She didn't ask me if she could have guests over,  only warned me once they were already there.  I was sitting around braless in a tank top and shorts to beat the heat; I felt beyond embarrassed and vulnerable that men I didn't know saw me like that.

Aside from my feelings on the matter: my mum has always enforced a ""no boys"" rule for me and a ""no girls"" rule for my brother because she's kind of set in her ways from the old country and considers it dishonourable.  I am okay with it.  My boyfriend's never been spotted around or in our home, similarly with my brother's girlfriend. My aunt across the road saw the boys sneaking out in the morning and called my other aunts;  they all discussed it and think I should reprimand J for breaking rules that she knew were important, not even a day after my mum left. They think it's disrespectful that while the homeowner's children follow and respect the rules,  a guest in the house is breaking them so flagrantly.  To be candid, I side with my aunts.  A guest that's agreed to live in our home should follow our rules, even if they feel arbitrary or outdated to her. 

Regardless, I don't think I should be the person to reprimand J because she's never been my responsibility or my choice.  I feel like I'd come across as an asshole if I tried to say anything because it's my mother's home and it is my mother's guest.  My mum said, as mentioned, that I am responsible for the house though. What do I do?  WIBTA if I told J that I've noticed a pattern of disrespect towards us and she's very much overstayed her welcome?"
429,bkmy2h,"AITA For Not Going to my mothers wedding years ago! Her and her husband won’t let it go. 

A few years back, right after I had my middle child, my mother and I were having problems. 

I lived on one of the higher floors in my apartment complex and there were no elevators. My mother thought that I needed to bring my kids to her house on a normal basis. Which wouldn’t have been such a problem. But like I tried to explain to her: it is hard to get two kids up and down the stairs, into the car, and what-not, all the time. I told her that we should compromise and she could come over to my house every once and awhile. Well, that didn’t go too well. Okay. Whatever. 

Then she said that if I ever needed a babysitter she would do it. Great. Awesome. But then she followed up by saying “ I won’t smoke in front of them but I might be high” like, lady. No. 

I used to smoke weed, but quit when I found out I was pregnant with my first. No, I have no problems with weed, but come on. Like, no, you’re not watching my children now. 

Then she tried to insert yourself into my parenting. I’m all for advice but don’t tell me what I should and shouldn’t do. 

My mother has and is still selfish. When it comes to everything. My problem with her started way before my middle child was born. 

When my first was born, his father and I lived with my mother. We kind of had own little space on the top floor. So it wasn’t really like we were living in a small little house with five or so people. But me and his father weren’t working so I told him it was over. I then moved to a smaller town near by to be a nanny for while and told my mother that I wasn’t going to move back in unless my ex left. She took his side. Said she wasn’t going to make him move. Like, this dude had a better chance of getting his own place than I did. But okay. Whatever. I moved out and made it work. 

But just everything with her started piling up and I got fed up. When her weeding came around, I didn’t go and cut contact with her for probably a year. We talk now but I keep a bit of distance. She’s my mother. I love her and my kids love her. But I’m done with her Manipulating and selfish ways."

I feel as if my family are acting like old heads about it. My mom and aunt are telling me it is disrespectful to keep a girl away from her family by spending so much time with her. My aunt keeps assuming that her father, little brother, and sister want to spend more time with her. Even if I weren't in their home, my gf spends most of her time in her room. Lately my GF and I have been falling asleep and we may accidently wake up at 2 or 3 AM. I guess that is a bit late, but I don't understand how my presence in a home after 11:59 PM is disrespectful unless I'm doing something inappropriate.

431,eqtu7l,"AITA for wanting to keep my grandmother's pearls Hi all so me (26f) and my fiance (27m) are getting married in April. This story started back in Jan 2012. My grandmother died and my grandfather, who was still alive at the time, set out all my grandmothers jewelry for all the grandkids to go through. My grandmother loved us all dearly and did a lot for us. So my aunt(50sF) who married into the family was also at this jewelry thing. She took anything of value including 3 sets of pearls. My grandmother got 3 sets so each of her sons' families could have a set. That was the beginning of seeing her greediness. When my grandfather got older and had to move my aunt went through his house before any of us could(my grandfather kept of telling us to take anything we wanted). Though he had promised items to people. She took WWII stuff promised to my brother and sold it and kept the money. She also took and sold anything else of value. My brother and I claimed some china which she took and boxed up. Now here is where things get worse. We requested the China multiple times over YEARS and she finally let us have it after my grandfather died, claiming she didnt know where it was. She did the same thing to my grandmother's veil I was going to wear. I have asked my dad to get our families set of pearls. There are 3 necklaces and I wanted our for our family. He said she said that was fine but wanted them back. I laughed and said she probably wont get them back because they are for our part of the family. She already has a set for her daughters, two of which are already married. So AITA for not wanting to give back the necklace after my wedding.

Sorry for any mistakes, first time poster."
432,bucptl,"AITA for not working un-compensated overtime to complete a project? I recently joined my company's Systems Engineering team. My company doesn't pay overtime and my manager doesn't want to give out TIL. The arrangement for if you work out of hours (weekend server maintenance for example) is:

* You can come in a bit later or leave earlier if you had to work more than your regular hours.
* This time isn't 1:1.
* I am discouraged to leave earlier because I am the only engineer based outside of the US time zone and I need to have an overlap with them.
* You must email the team if you plan to come in later or leave earlier but you shouldn't specify why this is (which feels dodgy to me) 

The problem with this is that my job responsibilities make it difficult to come in a little bit later. Given my role I am of course expecting to have to work late from time to time however the work life balance is so far off, last week I worked an extra 25 hours due to a multitude of issues, project deadlines etc. the burnout was real and because of the frequency that I was having to work late it was causing me issues in my personal life and impacting mental health. At the end of that 65-hour week I was sitting at my desk feeling miserable and un-motivated and underlying feeling was that by working so many un-compensated hours that my time value was decreasing.

Anyway, fast forward to the issue this week. I am making a conscious effort to leave work on time so I can go home and relax and spend time with my girlfriend, work on my side-business and study. However there is project this week that came back to me after a few issues came-up and because it's a related to a specialist platform that my team isn't trained on only I can really resolve the issues, instinctively I thought about working late to plough through it which is my traditional approach but I know that I won't get any sort of appreciation or acknowledgement for that and I'll end up just making myself miserable and because of my core proactive responsibilities I only really have 1 hour or 2 that I can work on this per day and this is the kind of project where I need to be able to lock myself in a room and give it my un-interrupted attention - I am keeping my team posted on this but I feel like they are expecting me to work late on this. 

I can't shake this feeling that I am being unfair for not putting in the extra effort, so please keep me in check, am I being an asshole for not giving up my personal time to get this project completed?"
433,cvcajw,"AITA for reporting my amorous but possibly clueless coworker to management He and I have been working together at a big box store for the last three years. He is originally from Uganda, I was born here in Canada and we are close in age. We are both very quiet and prefer to work independently, barely speaking a word to one another. The trouble started last October, when he told me he had romantic feelings for me. I was caught off guard and flustered, and I did not say I returned his feelings but I did not reject him at that time either. I simply went back to work and tried to forget what he'd said. I hoped that in time he would get the hint and let it go. 

But he did not let it go. He started texting and calling at all hours, and he began to talk to me as if I were already his girlfriend, calling me pet names and telling me he loved me. I did not respond to his texts and I let all his calls go to voicemail. I'm not good at saying no to people, so my plan was to ignore him until he stopped. At work I could not easily avoid him and tried to ignore him as much as possible. He told a mutual friend that he had a special bond with me.

After discussing the problem with my therapy group, I realized that I would have to be more direct with him if I wanted him to stop. One day after receiving yet another sappy text from him I finally responded and told him I was only interested in being work friends. He said he understood and for a while the unwanted attention stopped. I thought it had all just been a misunderstanding due to poor communication on my part and I was happy to give him the benefit of the doubt and move on. 

But he started doing it again. I blocked his number and social media, but I could not avoid him at work. I tried to be polite and stay away as much as I could but he would corner me when I was alone and continue to push his affections on me. I told him that it was making me so uncomfortable that I didn't even want to come to work and to knock it off. After trying unsuccessfully to resolve the issue on my own, I went to management. A manager spoke to him, and for a while he cut it out until just last week. 

He told me a couple nights ago that ""god makes someone for everyone and when you meet that person he will tell you."" Given our history I feel he was implying that he wouldn't give up on me because god is telling him to go for it. He asked for my phone number twice after I had requested he delete it in the past. I refused both times. 

Last night I caught him making googly eyes at me and I decided in that moment I needed to call him on it and tell him to stop all the other behaviors too. So I did, I told him to stop asking for my number and to stop with the comments or I would go to management. His expression immediately became angry and he said he had done nothing wrong before storming off. Before I left I told the manager he's bothering me again.

Now I'm sitting here wondering if I'm actually the asshole because I created this situation when I didn't outright reject him. Is he actually a victim of me?"
434,bygcg2,"AITA for calling my best friend out and assuming the worst of her? Alright. This happened forever ago but she keeps bringing it up in arguments and making me feel like im a dick in the situations.

Lets call my friend..Lily (not real name)

To give context, she's a bit more out there with sex and relationships, I'm the prude and normally the voice of caution about it in our friend group and I don't judge her for what she does with her body or person, never have unless I consider it terrible. This is something she knows well enough.

It was, again, forever ago, we were both very underaged at the time (maybe..12-13) and she started dating a guy online. At the time she didn't have a phone and was grounded from it so I let her use mine. She told me he was 17, i believed her and even talked with him some, becoming friends to an extent.
To put it vaguely, she was sending stuff to him and having more than pg calls with him and I didn't intervene until a school dance came around and he was fantasizing about driving down and taking her.
She slipped up, saying it wouldn't happen because he was 26.
At the time, i was fuming. She not only lied to me but knew it was blatantly illegal. She and I had an all out war for a few days, her justifying it with love is love and Im being a dramatic baby that just doesn't understand and that im being judegemental, I tried making her choose between me and her boyfriend, she only got further upset with me when I called him a pedofile. I eventually calmed down, saying I wouldn't support it and she couldn't use my phone, she proceeded to call me every name in the book while I did the same, being pissed.


Long story short, she broke up while him on her own terms, still holding my reaction over my head in this next incident.


We were having a sleepover a while later, at the time I was talking to a guy named..uh Mike. Mike was an online friend and slightly over 18, but I was older and I had no interest in him at all, nothing but friends. 
He called me during the sleepover and we talked, I go to use the bathroom and come back in the middle of it, it was fine until later she was chatting with him on my phone and I see the following:


'So did you like seeing it??' Without anything else (she had been deleting the comversation)


Now, 'it' could mean anything but I just knew what it was and took the phone, asking. He said 'personality' but I just knew he was lying because..obviously it wasnt Lily asking what she saw and he wasnt dumb enough to answer.
We ended up having a fight over it, she used MY phone and MY friend to once again do things she knew I wouldn't approve of and while I was in the bathroom no less. She cried about how I assumed she was nothing but a whore (bringing up previous situation) and even later admitted that's what went down. It blew over quickly afterward until we have little fights now and again where she breaks out that I think her of nothing more than a slut. Sure, I didn't have much to go one besides a weird message and 'I just knew' along with her deleting context but I was right in the end.


Am I the asshole in these situations? I used to think no 100% but its just kinda been on my mind that I over reacted or I was thinking the worst of her or I should've kept to myself and let her be decently happy in her relationship even if I thought it wrong.

My mom has been asking me lately to help pay with the rent and phone bills. It irritates me because I was coerced by my parents to buy a brand new car which I am now fully paying for by myself on top of internet and groceries ( we only have this 1 car). Main issue is that my dad has been jobless for the past 6 months because he’s addicted to gambling and thinks he can make a living from it, and his meth head sister sleeps in our living room and creates a mess and I always have stuff go missing if I leave it out. So I’m basically confined to my room.

My school is known for having terrible students so I am a bit of a loner... but I thought it would be different here. For my first day, I learn five pages. No ine else learned a word... I was okay with it, even though they were all there a few weeks before I came as I replaced someone before me.

Months pass, I learn more and more of the text. Half of them didn't even show up most of the time. A deadline passes. Then another one. We agree to move it to the next school year. At first I was okay with it, but now I regret accepting it.

Tbh I feel like leaving. It's not giving me any satisfaction and I feel like I'm wasting my time I could use to get better grades or get another hobby.

I just worry that the teacher will be mad at me, but can I do? I tried, I came to every practise, every time. I learned about 35 pages before they moved the first deadline, after which I was kinda ready to give up.

437,bykq87,"AITA for not saying hi to my gf’s parents This just happened yesterday so it’s still fresh in in my mind and I cannot shake it off, a third party opinion would help me a lot here 

Preface: I work two jobs, i go in at 6 am and get out around at 2pm, then go in again at 430pm till 1am. Her parents came around 4 so I said my hellos and eventually had to leave to work. 

I work at a resort/casino so I let her know to take her parents  to see the huge lake we have, I don’t think they are gamblers so not much else to do there. She later tells me that she’s in the downtown area with them.  A few hours later I take my new coworker (a good friend of mine) to the casino floor to meet a few clients and then go to the gift shop to get some coffee. I get a call from my gf asking if I was buying coffee and if so to get her some too and some things for her family, I tell her yea come in, apparently they walked by and called out to me by the door which sounds like a lie because the acoustics aren’t that bad and the cashier wasn’t too far from the door.  Anyways she comes in and I ask her where her family is at, she said they were sitting down somewhere in the lobby around the corner. I’m like ok.. apparently they only wanted some waters so we buy em and we walk out the door and she tells me “ well you got places to be so..” and take that as a queue to go back to the office 

She sent a text that she didn’t want to see my friends bitch ass face, I didn’t want to argue about anything, so I tell her well I don’t have anything to say about that. She continued and is mad that I didn’t say hi to her family and that they came to see me, I tell her well you sent me on my way and didn’t specify that you wanted me to say hi. We argue about that back and forth saying that I was disrespectful and embarrassed that I didn’t come out and say hi. And that i didn’t tell my friend to fuck off.i tell her that there was no need to tell my friend that and that her family should of went inside the gift shop OR she should of said let’s go say hi real quick.I told her that she sent mixed messages and was never clear on what she wanted to do. And I can’t read minds. 

I get home close to 2 am and she starts crying  in the couch( her parents are sleeping in the bed) and then she steps out side to cry some more, I go to her to comfort her and bring her back inside. She is mad mad like she tells me that she doesnt want to go anywhere with me, continues the argument which is circular at this point (example: why didn’t you say hi? You could of just told him to fuck off; why didn’t you initiate saying hi?) which I would give the same answers I’ve been telling her for the past many hours. I was tired and had to get up to work again in just a few hours so I just try to get some sleep.

I said I don’t know, I wasn’t getting back until December 22nd and I haven’t thought that far ahead. They kind of just brushed it off and said okay, bye. 

I left for Europe, had an amazing time and almost died from sickness on my way home, I finally arrived back and told my mum I was sick and wasn’t going to travel again. She said that was fine as Christmas at my grandparents had already been cancelled, they decided to travel (3000km away) to put their motorbike in a show for Boxing Day. 

I was better by Christmas Day enough that I could walk and not pass out, so I went to my brothers house (same town) for a quiet Christmas dinner. My other brother pulled me aside and told me that our grandparents weren’t there because they were angry at me. Apparently I said I didn’t want to go to Christmas at theirs so they cancelled it, when I asked my mum if this was true, she said yes, but I was from an argument almost 6 years ago. 

Now me and my grandparents have never really gotten along throughout my childhood, but it had gotten better over the last few years after my son was born.

My mum said the main arguement was at my sons first Christmas (8 years ago) we apparently got into and argument and I screamed at them I would take my son (their first great-grandchild) away and they would never see him again, I don’t remember this argument and neither do my brothers, my grandparents say my mum was in the kitchen at the time of the argument that’s why she didn’t know about it. I explained to my mum that I don’t remember any of this and if it was that bad wouldn’t my brothers remember it, wouldn’t she have come out of the kitchen to all the fighting, wouldn’t they have cut me off then, all I could say was that it must have been something horrible they did/said to have elicit that reaction out of me (they said they don’t know they did to start the fight), she agreed but you could still tell she was torn about who was wrong. 

Well come this Christmas, I find out that my grandparents aren’t coming and have stopped talking to everyone in my family because of me and our fight last year, and my mum said that if I just contacted them and apologised that everything would go back to normal. But I feel like I have nothing to apologise for. 

So, AITA for refusing to apologise to my grandparents just so that they’ll talk to everyone else again?

TLDR; my grandparents stopped talking to everyone in family because of a fight both last year/8 years ago."
439,7fhd56,"AITA for wanting my house to not be dirty? So my uncle's apartment is just below my apartment, and he has the keys for my apartment and everything. He normally just fixes problems or something when i am away. But the last week, when i left my town I returned to find my apartment filled with his stuff, which filled half of my living room (also dirty used pottery, and cutlery!). He apparently stored them because he had a party at his apartment. This happened without my consent, and one week after the party meaning he had so much time to clean that. I later confronted him about it (not aggressive but perhaps abrupt) and he was firstly shocked about my ""awful"" personality and afterwards he started telling me that i am an ungrateful shit, that i am a disgrace, that he wont talk to me again, that i was raised badly (i have never seen him so angry in my life), he said that after everything he has done to me i am saying that, and then he proceeded grabbing  my shirt and he would have punched me if it wasnt my grandma there. He now doesnt want to talk to me, and he says that I am dead to him. So AITA for hurting his ego? "
440,dn4w68,"AITA for leaving a new guy in charge while I left work because my relief was late So I have 2 jobs and I've always made it really clear to my second job that my main job comes first no matter what. I'm not losing my best paying job for a dime a dozen side job. This has always been clearly understood and accommodated they are really short staffed so any time I can work and help out is appreciated. I'm also a manager at the side job which is important here. 

I got a last minute text asking me to come into my main job 1-1/2 to 2 hours early the next day so I text my boss at the side job that night explaining I would need to be out earlier then usual. No response. The next morning I open up and i call him first thing in the morning to confirm he knew i needed to be out earlier then usual and he said that was fine because the night manager was scheduled to come in at the time i needed to leave so it would all work out. That time eventually comes and the night manager hasn't shown up but I need to leave soon. I text her but she doesnt respond, A new employee (couple weeks in) shows up early, he knows absolutely nothing about how the computers work but hes all I have. The other person inside working with me doesnt speak good (or any really) english.

So I give him a quick run down of the computers (because the whole time hes been here they haven't shown him how to answer phones or take orders, I only work 2 days a week and this was my 3rd time meeting him) gave him my password, and tell him if he has any questions at all to call me and I'll walk him through it. He should only be alone for 30 minutes tops because the next manager should be on their way and we're pretty slow at the time so I didnt expect any real problems. Then I grab my stuff and leave. 

I just barely get to my main on time, only had 2 calls from him and nothing sounds like it went terribly wrong but the night manager ended up being an 1 hour 20 minute late. I couldn't have waited that long for them to show up but I also feel really bad about just leaving the store without a manager for that entire time and especially with someone who was so untrained and lost.

He is one of my closest online friends. We play a lot of skilled FPS games and he is the most skilled in our friend group. He blocked me on xbox a few months ago for ""not listening to him"" when we play. We worked it out and everything was fine when suddenly today I found that he blocked me again. I asked him why and all he did was text me a thumbs up. I was genuinely confused though so I pushed the subject and asked him again why he had blocked me. I even brought up the fact that our last few games together didnt have any issues. He again only replied with a thumbs up. I left it alone for the rest of the day but I decided to ask one last time because I am concerned about our friendship and he replied with ""you're annoying"" this hurt a lot because like I said before, he is one of my closest online friends and if he is playing a game with our friend group I can no longer join in because he has blocked me. So Am I The Asshole if I call him out for being a shit friend? and what other advice do you have for this situation?

TL;DR: Close friend has blocked me on xbox for ""being annoying"" and has thus excluded me from my main friend group online. AITA if I tell him he is a shithead?"
442,4snznj,"AITA For not wanting to contribute any money to a TV for my Brothers’ man cave? My dad and 2 brothers have been working at turning our basement into a man cave for when friends come to visit, so that they’re not hogging the TV or making a mess of the living room. We’ve all worked together to paint, sand, and tile and now we’re at the point of getting the entertainment for this area. The Man Cave is, in theory, for everyone but in reality I will never use it. I have a nice TV in my bedroom, and am almost never home to use it as it is. When I do hang out with my friends it’s literally never at my house. This is a thing for my 2 brothers to take advantage of, when their friends come over to watch a sports ball game or whatever. 

Still, even though I will not be using it I both offered and agreed to contribute my Xbox One to the project so that they can play their games and watch their shows. All that’s left is acquiring TV, about $600-$1000 is what they’re expecting to spend on a decent one. Well, now they (And by “They” I mainly mean my dad) is trying to get me to go in about $200 on the TV. I’ve tried explaining that my contribution was the Xbox and games which I could have easily sold for more than that amount (It’s the Halo 5 Edition) and do not intend on contributing any cash. Aside from the fact that shelling out $200 would destroy my entire 2 week budget, which is tight in the best of times, I will not be using this area at all. I did not need to just give them my Xbox and games, and am getting rather pissed off at being pressured into helping with the TV as well. I get that splitting it 4 ways is easier than splitting it 3 but its money that I just don’t need to spend on a luxury like that. 

But now I’m wondering; since this is technically a Family Project, Am I The Asshole for not wanting something towards the TV? 

EDIT: Additional Info
I'm 26 Years old and living at home. I only live at home because most of my income goes to helping with household expenses, though some of it is cultural as well. 
I bought the Xbox and the TV in my room with my own money, the TV was purchased years ago.

444,bv9qdq,"WIBTA if I stop my girlfriend using my bathroom? So just for quick note, there is two other bathrooms in the house, my bathroom is connected to my bedroom.  


So my problem with my girlfriend is that she doesn't care much about it being clean or leaving mess around it. When she uses my shower, I dont have a problem with her doing it, but more the aftermath of her using it.  
One time I told her that it was fine for her to get the stray hands that come when washing her hair and just place them on the tiles while in the shower and get them off when she's done. (I used to do this when I had long hair, used to irritate me when trying to clean myself so it was a trick that stuck)  


The problem is, she doesn't clean off her hair after her shower, She visits one night each weekend, stays over and showers the next morning. Its not a problem for her to shower, but it is a problem that she doesn't clean up. Especially as she leaves hairs in the drain as well and doesn't clear those out either, I know they're not mine for my head has rather short black/dark brown hair and she has light brown hair herself  


My next issue is to do with the toilet in the bathroom. I recently got it fixed (2 months ago) to the best that I can currently afford (not much) and so I got it cleaned, unclogged and to the best I could working, but unfortunately the macerator in the toilet is INCREDIBLY weak, to the point you cannot put toilet paper down that toilet or it blocks it with incredible ease. I told my girlfriend about this a couple months ago, and so far she has been fine. Using the toilet but clearing away in one of the other toilets down the hall. This weekend however she forgot, right before she then left for the week, and I now have to try and unclog the toilet which at best takes a couple hours due to having to wait for the water to descend down (the macerator can let water through, but not waste or toilet paper) She apologised to me after she did it but made no effort to fix the toilet herself or even let me know about the problem till I tried to use the toilet later in the week.   


I want to talk to her about these issues but I do not want to have an argument with her so my thought was to come here and check, am I being out of line? or more specifically, WIBTA?"

I was booking a train for a trip and the App told me during the booking process that the train will be full and that I should consider reserving a seat. I went for it since its only 4.50 Euro and I really needed to get some work done during the trip. 

The train was absolutely packed, but I quickly found my seat and saw that a pregnant woman sat in it. I showed her my reservation and politely asked her to leave, already earning some judging looks from the other passengers. She refused and went on a pretty long tirade, calling me disrespectful and a disgrace for men.

I didnt want to make a huge scene and felt really awkward so I offered her to buy the seat from me for 4.50 Euro. She refused again and called me a greedy son of a bitch. 

At that point I got really pissed, waited for the conductor and informed him about the situation. He asked the lady to leave and I was able to sit. However, everybody was staring me into the ground.

I really dont know how to feel about this. I think I was in the right but obviously the other passengers didnt feel the same way. I havent talked about it with family or friends, afraid of their reaction.

446,cuhsex,"AITA for not wanting to send money to my cousin in the Philippines? Here’s some backstory: 

When my mom moved to the states from the Philippines she promised my uncle that she would pay for my cousin to attend school. My mom figured that by sending my cousin to private school and college, she would be able to get a really good job and take care of her parents. And they wouldn’t have to depend on my mom forever. In the Filipino culture, it’s pretty much expected that the children take care of their parents. Especially the oldest sibling. 

Things got sketchy when my cousin kept asking my mom for more and more money. She claimed that they were for books and what not. My mom got suspicious so she personally called the college and found out that my cousin had not paid two semesters worth of tuition. She also found out that they lied about the tuition cost. Obviously, my mom was pissed so she cut them off. The funny thing is she was almost done with nursing school and my mom had a job lined up for her already. 

Fast forward, that same cousin asks me for money all the time. The thing is I already send money to my uncle who my cousin and her kids live with. The money I send covers food and some extra things they need every month. But she’s begging me. I understand that life in the Philippines is tough and I’m better off than they are but I just feel like she made her bed. My fiancé thinks we should just send her money because she has kids and they don’t have a supportive father and maybe she will stop asking for money for awhile. Idk though. 

My cousin does have a job but I’m sure it doesn’t pay very much. 

Am I an asshole for not wanting to send her money?"
447,bsuxwp,"AITA for not buying from my SIL and instead buying at big box store? My sister in law is an extreme couponer and has so much extra she sells it to make more money.  Yesterday she had some 24 packs of water selling for $2.75. I passed and said I would just wait because Walmart has them for $2.75 for the 40 pack.  She told me I was rude and should be supporting her and not the big companies and it’s people like me who make it hard for her and other “small business” owners to make money.  I bit my tongue from telling her exactly what I though of her “small business” and just shrugged.

I buy from her All the time (detergent and soaps and other things) but I am a teacher and mother of three with two in daycare and summer starting so a third to pay for child care too (I work all summer) and am currently pinching pennies.  I feel totally justified for choosing to get the cheaper stuff else where (esp when she pays pennies for everything and sometimes gets money back from the store for her stuff).  She tried to guilt me into “think about the children” and I reminded her I was, “my” children and she got mad.

I give her stuff for free all the time.  Mostly hand me downs but new stuff too.  She makes me pay for ANYTHING she gives from hand me downs to a drink.  I think she gets money hungry for everything.  But she is my SIL so I buy from her when I can and esp when it saves me money.  She also does raffles for big items she gets for free or buys for cheap.  Ex) She get Victoria Secret lotions and perfumes on clearance.  Then will raffle them for $2 a ticket but make it 60 tickets so she makes $120 off of $10 she paid.  I usually don’t buy raffle tickets.  She tells me the same thing that I am not supporting her.  But my job is to support my family and not hers.  I can’t always buy raffle tickets when my chances to win are slim to none.  (I am just not that lucky.)

So that's exactly what i told my dad, and he is working on getting me up there now, so here is where i may be TA, I told my friends I'm moving there, but I'm too afraid to tell my family.  

So I told my dad ""I would prefer you to do it, I'm too nervous and scared to say it"" my dad is gonna tell my mom and grandma soon.

1. I am close to my grandparents
2. I have three siblings, but the one that I'm close to is living at my dads too
3. It'll be me, my dad, my brother, and my stepmom at my dads house
4. The reason I'm moving there are that I'm NOT happy most of the time

...Cries 3/7 nights
...Flips me off and curses at me when drunk
...Owes me about $125 ( which is a lot for me, cause I get $10 a week, so that's 3 MONTHS of work)
...Promises to take me somewhere then ""gets sick"" or ""forgets"" even though I'll tell her 5 or 6 times
...used to hit my sister
...is fine with my 15y/o brother smoking weed and drinking alchohol
... punishes me when she punishes 15y/o brother

449,cpwqaq,"AITA for telling my SO to sort out his priorities? So for a bit of background...
Over the past few months, me and my SO have made plans to live together come September. Over the past few months, I had been unemployed and was supported by my SO until I got back on my feet after dealing with anxiety and depression. I now got a new job and I am paid reasonably well to live off of. Due to my partner working part time whilst studying, I now support both of us just for a little while until he gets back into the swing of things. We had originally agreed to split everything to cover the cost of the new place we are moving into, but due to the financial stresses, I agreed to pay my partners half of the deposit as well as my own. Tb is amounts to almost £600 

The now situation:

Over the past few months, we had planned to go to a festival this year. Due to everything that has happened, I agreed to cancel the plans and use the money I would be spending on tickets to be spent on the flat instead. My SO had looked forward to this for ages but nothing was set in stone, but he was still very disappointed. 
Today, he told me that he wants to go because his family and friends are going, so he's going to borrow money to pay for a ticket. 
I told him that if he had money to spend on a ticket to the festival, then he has that money to put towards the deposit that I'm paying for. He hung up on me and left me feeling very angry and hurt. I told him to sort out his priorities. 

I feel like us moving in and paying a deposit should be more of a priority than going to a festival? 

Am I the asshole?

Edit: just so it's clear, I was the one dealing with anxiety and depression at the time, not my SO. 

A lot of arguments have been him using the fact that he used to financially support me and throwing it in my face."

451,bb8c1p,"AITA for feeling annoyed that my boyfriend's mom kept some of my clothes meant for donation? I believe I'm technically not in the wrong because this is all in my thoughts and I haven't vocalized this or made it evident, but I wanted to see if I'm justified in the way I feel.

I kept a running donation box for 6 months in my apartment, and would periodically throw clothes in there when I felt ready to donate them. There were a lot of clothes in there near the end and they ranged from more inexpensive stuff like F21 and H&M to slightly more expensive clothes from Ann Taylor and J.Crew. Nothing extremely expensive/designer, but there were clothes in there that were barely worn or still with tags on them. I thought it'd be nice to donate everything; not to mention, I didn't have time to even think about selling them.

My BF and I have been together for 5 years, and his little sister (20yo) is a similar size as me, maybe one size larger (XS vs. S). It did cross my mind that I could've given some clothes to her, but 1) I've already done that in the past with two nice coats, 2) she's never displayed a ton of appreciation for gifts, 3) their family is not hurting for $, with an income of \~$1m.

His mom came over, noticed the box, and asked what it was about, so I explained that I'd been wanting to donate the clothes. She said, ""Oh! I could just drop it off at the donation center in \[underserved town next to hers\], if you'd like?"" I thought that was really generous of her, and took her up on the offer after double checking it was not a chore for her.

Anyway, I saw his parents again weeks later and mom said, ""You had some pretty decent stuff in there! I took and saved some for \[sister\].""

I can't help but feel totally annoyed with this. On one hand - yes, mom was kind enough to drop it off for me. On the other hand - the clothes were meant to be donated.

He had assumed that: a Girl we know was in love with him (rejected him twice and had a bf) and because of that, and the fact that a random coworker asked when he got off work (he assumed that random guy was the bf) he assumed that the  bf was coming to kill him because of it.

At first, he was a nice guy. Whenever our ""family"" went out to eat he would always bring us things to play with like his 3DS. He would usually also pay for the meal. I saw him as a father figure for a moment until he moved in with us. Then, I started noticing the subtle changes to my household. He was starting to control it, squeezing his grip tighter and tighter as the years went by, but my mother was oblivious to the fact. My internet access was now being restricted unlike before. Keep in mind I had done nothing to get it restricted, my brother and I have always been good kids both academically and in the household (chores, helping mom, etc.) Sure, we had to be reminded once in a while but we never objected to doing so as it was only my mother who was the caretaker of the house.  Then, he started installing cameras in the house. This might seem normal as our neighborhood wasn't known to be the best in terms of security. I thought so too until he started excessively monitoring them. When he came home, he would point out every small little detail that was wrong. Currently, he has control over most of the house, including the computer I am writing this on. Hopefully he doesn't see this. He put a lock on my mother's bedroom, and she isn't allowed in without his permission. My mother is being influenced by his parenting style as I have noticed she has cut down on the amount I am allowed to go out with my friends. My mother defends him by stating the only reason he is like this is because he has cancer and because he is old.

455,c6zfvw,"WIBTA if I made meals my family doesn’t like? My family consist of my husband, and two sons, ages 14 and 11. I do almost all the cooking for the family. My husband will make dinner one night a week if I need him to due to work. That dinner is normally pasta or he will order pizza/take out. 

My husband on older son are picky eaters. My younger son is to a lesser extent. Husband doesn’t like eggs, beans, fish or shellfish, yogurt, sour cream, anything cream based, casseroles. Older son doesn’t like pasta, red sauce, most vegetables (exceptions are potatoes, corn, peas, mixed veggies). Younger son is not a big fan of red meat and fish that is not breaded and fried, and not a big fan of pizza. 

To complicate things, I am obese and joined WW to lose weight and improve my health. I’ve lost 40 pounds but still have a ways to go. Most of the foods on my zero point list are things someone in the family won’t eat. I’ve been making multiple meals to appease everyone but I’m tired of acting like a short order cook. 

WIBTA if I made a meals that I know some family members would not like? I would post a menu in the kitchen so everyone knew what was coming and they could plan to make themselves dinner if they didn’t like it. I do already try to get them involved in meal planning but the kids never participate, saying they don’t care or have any ideas. My husband participates but his ideas are usually really high point. I’ve been making a lot of chicken and they all complain about sprouting feathers. I’d like to incorporate things like fish and shrimp and meatless options more often but don’t because someone (or maybe all of them) wouldn’t even try it.

Edit: Wow! This got way more responses than I thought it would. Some additional info for those who have asked- I work a full time job that can be quite demanding. My kids can cook a little bit. They are completely capable of using the microwave and making soups or prepared chili on the stove top. My older son can heat things in the oven as well. I agree with the commenters that day I’ve spoiled them and I need to get them in the kitchen more. It will be good for them to have that knowledge when they become adults. My plan would be to have things I know they can prepare or put together at all times, so soups, chili, sandwich bread and fixings. I always make a big salad and hard boiled eggs in the fridge.

456,bs2ljx,"WIBTA Of I complained to the academic dean about my math teacher and asked for my math grade to be curved? So to start. I’m on mobile so formatting errors

TLDR: My math teacher purposely gave us a test none of us were prepared for and no one passed. Then he blamed us for being unprepared.

So my math teacher we’ll call K. K has been teaching here at my school for almost two decades now, but he’s know as a kind of a hardass that purposely makes his tests hard and quizzes hard. He says that it’s to prepare us for college but we’re already at a college prep school. As soon as the year started about 2/3 of the class shifted out. So there is only about 5 to a class (He has two). The school asked him to cool it this year, but he didn’t really. So at the second semester mark they asked him to leave (short for fired).

K also makes it a habit of his to blame us for being unprepared and doing bad on his quizzes. Then goes on a rant demeaning us for about 5 minutes a class. I try my best to at least keep a B or better in all my classes and I’ve managed to do so until now. This is my junior year so this is what colleges are going to see when they look at me.

I’ll give another example: I was out sick for a day    due to a really bad head cold and fever. Next class period that I see him he hands me a quiz on the stuff that I had missed. I had openly told him before this that I was unprepared and would do poorly on it. Of course I bombed it. Then he told me it was my fault for being unprepared.
Then the logarithms test came up (Yes Algebra 2) the class was openly unprepared. When the test came around I felt horribly about it. I had almost no idea how to do it. I got a 48 on the test. The average was below that. Then he goes on about our unpreparedness and decides to only curve it 10 pts great now I have a 58, still failing. My average drops around 5 points down to a 77. Now all I have is the exam to possibly raise that back. Other class members have all ready complained to the academic dean about it. But I’m a really quiet, introverted guy that doesn’t really like to make much trouble for other people. WIBTA?"
457,bk9gie,"AITA for not talking to mother until she apologises to me? I (25F) moved out last year but my mother, stepfather, sister (22F), stepbrother (15M), and stepsister (11F) all live together.

My mother can be difficult but our relationship has been better since I moved out and 95% of the time we get on. However, 2 weeks ago there was a massive argument between her and stepbrother. It was something small, but she exploded and told stepdad that she didn’t want stepbrother living there anymore.

My sister text me to let me know what had happened (Everything was fine when I’d left earlier). She doesn’t deal well with conflict. I am incredibly protective of her, and am usually the mediator for all family arguments. Stepdad and stepbrother left the house, and I told them to go to my house, and stepbrother could stay there for the night.

I went to my mother’s house to check on sister and then to chat to my mother and see if there was something underlying going on. I have a key, so I let myself in and my mother saw me and quite aggressively said ‘what are you doing here?’. I said I was just going to check on sister. She huffed and stormed off. I checked on sister who was crying but calming down, and then went to talk to my mother.

First, she wouldn’t talk to me, and insisted on staring out the window. Then she told me I might as well leave, because she wasn’t going to talk to me. After some pushing on my part she said she was always made out to be the bad guy. I didn’t know enough to make any judgements, and was more interested in trying to understand what was causing this. She didn’t care and kept saying that I had judged her, before telling me that she couldn’t believe that I didn’t care enough about her to talk to her first when I came in, and that she would do anything for me and clearly I wouldn’t do the same, and she couldn’t believe I prioritised my sister.

This was so hurtful to me, because I am always there to support my family, and am actually moving in for a week next week to look after my step siblings whilst her and stepfather go on holiday. I spoke to sister first because I knew it would be a much quicker easier conversation, leaving me with more time to talk properly with my mum. I even explained this to her. After her carrying on along these lines, I ended up getting upset and telling her that enough was enough, and I wasn’t going to be there for her if that’s how she wanted to talk to me.

Since then we haven’t spoken. Everyone else has made up, but they have told stepbrother that he needs to improve behaviour (normal teenage boy stuff) or he’ll be sent back over 200 miles away to live with his emotionally abusive mother. I’ve already discussed with my partner the option of us taking him in if this were to happen, as he’s in the middle of exams.

AITA for not talking to my mother until she apologises? I’m still going to help out next week, but I’m going to get there after they’ve left, and leave before they get back."
458,cagy16,"WIBTA - Friend doesn't respect my phobia TLDR; Friend doesn't respect certain boundaries of mine (not sure if that's even the right way to phrase it) .. I've told her directly multiple times that it bothers me ... so WIBTA if I give her a taste of her own medicine?


So a little backstory ..... I've got a weird thing about feet, I hate them, even my own. When I was a kid my phobia was so bad that I was NEVER barefoot, except for swimming/showering etc. If even my own bare feet touched any of my bedding or a piece of clothing, I'd immediately have to wash it. I've gotten a ton better over the years, I have to wash my hands after touching my feet, but that's about it. I still don't like other people's feet, won't touch them and don't want them near me. 

My friend knows about this phobia, we've been friends for about 10 years, I was her maid of honor. Lately, she thinks it's funny to put her foot on me, and laughs at me freaking out. I've gotten pissed off and yelled at her about it, and she tells me I'm overreacting and it's ""just a foot"". I've also had serious talks about it with her, telling her I don't do things I know bother her, so why would she keep doing these things just to bug me. 

I have another ""quirk"" she knows about, where I would just rather people put the lid down on the toilet before flushing. I even have a funny vinyl sticker on it to remind people. (Google toilet flush plume, that explains why I prefer this). She will use my washroom, then come out joking about how she left the lid up. If I confront her about this, she says I'm ridiculous to be worried about it because I let my dog on the furniture, so according to her it's all covered in poop now anyways.

I'm frustrated, and talking to her about it doesn't seem to make a difference, so WIBTA if I stop avoiding doing things that bother her in the same way? If she doesn't respect my boundaries, why should I respect hers? 

I know this might not be the mature way to handle it, but it's really stressing me out and I'm on the verge of just cutting her out and moving on. I don't really want to throw away a 10 year friendship, but I'm really at the end of my rope with her, there's been other problems, but these are the most recent. 

Thanks for reading my ramblings! I'll accept whatever verdict you guys come to."
459,ckyoj6,"AITA for not wanting my son to stay with his dad and his soon to be step - mom? Hello everyone!

I'm a year and a half into my divorce of a husband who I spent 10 years with. It's not finalized yet and we've been sharing custody of our son (6). We divorced due to him cheating with me mutable times with a family friend, he intends to marry now. I've never allowed my own feelings and humiliation damage my son's relationship with his dad. We are both mature between drop ups and picks up, re - scheduling and managing the financial part and have never fought. I've never bad mouthed him, or even mention him around my son despite feelings I'm working through because I know how impressionable he is.

The issue raised though when ex's fiance moved in with her 2 children. She and I use to be close friends, but obviously have no relationship at the moment. I know she speaks badly about me and repeated private things I once confided in my ex husband about to other friends and her older children. Word gets around. Recently my son has been returning home repeating foul language and asked me the definition of words, such as whore, c\*nt, insane etc. When I ask where he picked that vocab up, he says she was saying that what dad's fiance calls you. He then started talking about a swimming pool and mentioned about me going 'into' the deep end. I asked him what he meant about that. He told me again, dad's fiance was saying you going into the deep end, which I assume he meant to say going off the deep end. He asked me if I was going anywhere which I replied no. He mentioned that didn't make sense because she said you're going to leave me after they have the wedding because you'll be too sad.

I will admit, once I realized about the affair I became incredibly depressed and was needing a great deal of therapy so my son spent more time at his father's new place. I really didn't want him to see me like that. Both ex and his fiance became aware of what was going on. I've been doing much better now with the right medication and support, which ex is aware of as well. Perhaps my son is just misphrasing, but I feel like his future step mom is saying things she should about me and I really don't want him over there if she's involved. I haven't messaged my ex, I intend to speak to him in person tomorrow. Would I be the AITA if I asked him to stop having her around him unsupervised?

Also throwaway because I'm ashamed asking and admitting this I couldn't do it on my regular account."

461,bou0sy,"AITA on this car repair? I had a family member,T who was pregnant that had broken down due to an overheated engine a couple of times in our lovely SoCal heat. I did not like this as T was family and offered to do the repair if they provided parts and a simple 12pk of beer. The typical family charge. It was the water inlet. I also noticed a few coolant hoses that needed replaced.Armed with the knowledge of what parts were needed I informed T she could get parts at Autozone. about 120 USD. The day arrived when T dropped off the car. When asking for the parts all that was provided was the water inlet and some coolant. They had decided to not change the hoses at this time. I did the repair keeping the hoses. The hoses were worse than first thought and fell apart when removing. I had to shorten some but still had them secured and not leaking. When T came to pick up the vehicle I said to keep an eye on the hoses and be gentle. T left and I continued my day off taking care of the wife as she was sick.A little more info, my job provides me a car I take home and mine just sits in the drive way. T had a history of making cars life span end after a few short months. Multiple accidents. T wanted to use the car. I just did not feel comfortable with that.It is about 930PM when I get a message.

T:Hey, Something is wrong with the car. we had to come to the hospital because I was cramping bad and when we got out of the car we saw it was steaming and leaking.

W: T wants you to come swap cars until you have a chance to look at it.

T calls OP

T:Hey, I need you and wife to come down to the hospital and drop your car off until you can look at mine. We are gonna be done here soon and I am tired and need to rest.

OP:I'm sorry but that is not gonna happen. Wife is sick and has been in bed all day. I replaced what you wanted and fixed your car your way but I told you something like this might happen when I fixed your car this morning

T:You didn't fix shit. I am tired and cant deal with this.

OP:I am sorry but it is late I have work in the morning and I am not waking wife...(T hangs up)

T Messages.

T: I cant believe you are acting like this when I am in the hospital, my kid has school, I don't have a car that is working, W needs to get to work and you cant let me use your car?

OP: I cant do that. I can look at the car my next day off but I told you when I fixed the car that this was bound to happen.

T:You didn't fix shit, its still leaking and you are gonna leave me stranded and pregnant at the hospital. your fucking ridiculous.

462,cmbbkc,"WIBTA for calling my friend/Room Mate our on not being able to afford anything? Sorry if this is formatted badly, I don’t post on reddit almost ever.

Also please no ‘just don’t live with him’ , we’ve been friends since grade school and I’m not willing to do that. 

My friend and room mate (we’ll call him RM) for the past couple of weeks has been pretty constantly complaining about being out of money. Even when our whole friend group is going to the public pool that costs $5 to enter, RM says he can’t afford it, and and if asked if he really can’t spare $5, RM guilts everyone by saying something along the lines of ‘I’m sorry I don’t have the expendable income you all do’. 

But then suddenly last week he decides to spend $800 on a last minute trip to California to see a girl he met off tinder, to get laid. I know This, because he is, at the same time, seeing a few other women. RM even got one to drop him off at the airport!!

Their are smaller examples of similar behavior, but this the most he has just spent out of the blue.

Now he is saying that the places we are renting from and looking to rent, he can’t afford, and I keep biting my tongue on what he’s doing, but i feel like as a friend, I should be calling him on his BS so he hopefully sees it.

463,cpj2qx,"AITA for breaking off contact with my 6 y/o goddaughter? Bit of context: I suffered from several psychological problems I was only recently able to get rid off because of my compulsively lying psycho of a mother who did everything to make my life hell. Once I was no longer around she needed another victim for her fucked up antics and long story short ~3 years later she emptied my fathers bank accounts, grabbed anything of value, left the house and eventually got a divorce. Stealing wasn’t unusual for her. When I was 16 I had my first job & made approximately $400/month she stole $2k from me. Not because she needed it, just because she could. 

What does that have to do with my goddaughter? Well, despite my mother being a psycho I had a great bond with my sister and was delighted when she found a man she wanted to marry and asked me to become godfather of their daughter.

All was fine for a bunch of years until my wife and I moved and I wanted to pick up several things from the house my sister was living in. My father let them live rent-free in the family home but I had some stuff in a garage attached to the house. Some items of financial value and some of immense personal value like a guitar my godfather gave me for my 7th birthday. Needless to say that I was floored to find “my” garage empty and that everything of value was missing.

Despite initially blaming my mother for taking the stuff, and me obviously believing that lie, I soon found out through my father that my sister is the only one with a key besides myself. When I confronted her she went ballistic. I was accused of being the worst human being on planet earth but the fact that she sold my stuff was somehow never addressed. 

I went home, talked to my wife and we both came to the conclusion that they probably are embarrassed, that it’s only stuff and that I probably would have to let it slide if I wanted to keep the relationship to my sister & goddaughter, so I eventually did exactly that.

This whole ordeal happened in June last year. 

A few months ago I found out that around that time my sister also started spreading really asinine rumors about me behind my back. I asked several family members to send me the stories my sister shared with them in a short text so I had something to show to her expecting her to lie and deny it all (which she did) and went to confront her. She wasn’t pleased. Especially not about me talking to relatives. For some reason it’s my fault that she looked bad for telling lies. 

For an additional two months my goddaughter kept coming over at approximately the same rate but I soon realized my sister now was indoctrinating her own daughter with lies. It just reminded me too much of my abhorrent childhood and my sister seems to be turning into the same exact psychopath as my mother. I had enough and severed all ties.

464,cib2ig,"WIBTA: Refusing to Merge Bank Accounts With My Husband? My husband and I have been married for almost three years now. Due to serval circumstances (mostly being lazy but also because I haven’t been working and going to school so we’ve just been using his bank account) we have not gotten around to merging our bank accounts. We have mentioned it in passing but it’s never been that important to us. We do have several financial purchases together such as two car payments, phone bills, etc.

Some relevant backstory: Since having been married my husband has made several large purchases without consulting me. These purchases have totaled over $3000 dollars total. I’ve never really been mad about the purchases themselves because they’re things he’s wanted and also we can afford them. However I have been extremely upset over his lack of communication regarding these purchases. I have been left out of the loop and only find out once he has already purchased these non-refundable items. I have expressed multiple times that he is breaking my trust regarding him and money.

Flash forward to now and I just finished school and landed a high paying job. Suddenly he is very set on merging our bank account and I’m concerned. It has only been about 4 months since his last large purchase without consulting me. I’m obviously very open to helping out with bills/rent/etc but would I be the asshole if I refuse to merge bank accounts due to lack of trust?"
465,ekh1q5,"WIBTA if I didn't let my brother play on my playstation? My brother is two years older than me and goes to college. When he isn't at home I spend my free time in my basement, playing on the consoles that I bought my self. Practically everything in the basement is actually bought by me, the wii u, the playstation, switch, the games on the shelves, and practically ever other nerdy or geek like thing that can be found in this house. And when my brother comes home from college he comes down into the basement and essentially takes over MY stuff!

Look I'm really not trying to be the ""entitled asshole younger sibling"" but I do want to stress that this is my stuff. Things I bought with my own money that I worked for. My brother doesn't respect my space and I've tried multiple times to ask him to keep the place clean. Or do things like not leave the fucking playstation on for four fucking days at time. Things like DON'T FUCKING CHARGE YOUR JUUL IN MY FUCKING WII U.

When my brother comes home there isn't much room for him to go to you see. Recently my older sister was here so she took the guest bedroom leaving my brother to the basement. When he's here I want him to have his own space as my as mine which is why I try to kinda give him the basement while he's here. I would really hate taking away some of his personal space by telling him that he couldn't use my playstation (also for record we don't have cable on this specific TV so it would also be taking away his ability to watch ESPN, Netflix, etc. which is why I'd feel so bad about taking it away)

I'm thinking of moving my playstation to my room. Or just simply saying he can't play on it unless he learns to clean up after himself. But I've been sharing my games with him since forever, and I know he'd be upset if I didn't let him play on it. I know I should be telling him these things again and not reddit but trust me I've really tried to let him know my annoyance with him. I think he got the hint when he was talking to my cousin and said something like ""my playstation"" I kinda went off on him and said ""your playstation that *I* bought?"". I can tell he's been a little more careful with his words after that but he still manages to turn the basement to utter ruins every time he comes down here.

#####Why am I ignoring her?

Like I said, she's my childhood best friends mom but she's always looked down at me because well, I'm from a poor family but that's water under the bridge.

Several years ago I had went to visit my best friend at his new home overseas on his invitation as he was going thru a hard time balancing his new life.

Our friendship sunk because I felt that he only reaches out to me when he needed something and I felt I've carried him long enough.

When his mom found out I was visiting he told me that she said some unpleasant things about me and wasn't happy that I was there.

Cool.

I never challenged her about it. It was kinda expected given the person we knew she was.

No biggie.

So flash forward to now and she's right there, facing me but I don't look in her direction and I hope to God she doesn't try to come over as I know that I'll rebuff her pretentious ""warm approach"" and that will immediately make me the bad guy because my lid stays unlocked.

She's been waving... I don't know if she's called my name tho. I've even walked by the table to go get my coffee reheated.

There's currently an ongoing dispute in our house as to whether we should sell our gaming console.

Around a year ago, me and three other housemates split the cost of the xbox one four ways.

Now two of the housemates have PC's and no longer use the Xbox, and are now wanting to sell it, however the other two housemates still use the Xbox regularly. 

The housemates who want to sell the Xbox feel they should be able to cash their ""Share"", this means  selling the Xbox entirely, gaining each of us around £50, however this means the two who don't want to sell have to spend an additional £50 continue owning the gaming console, and they feel as if it's unfair to pay the extra money.

The two housemates who don't want to sell feel it is fairer to sell it at the end of the year when we all move out, and then split the money as there is then no demand from anyone to use it.

468,e32yvk,"WIBTA if I told my roommate I won’t share my weed with her anymore? Hi everyone, first post here. I’ll try to give enough context for this. So I work full time and I’m also a full time student, and I also finance myself completely. My roommate and best friend of many years is a part time student, doesn’t have a job, and relies on her parents for ALL her finances. We are both long time weed smokers and since we moved in together we will usually just buy a ton of weed and share it. (We live in a state where it isn’t legal and we’re both underage so we have to buy a ton when we have the chance). However recently I have been thinking a lot, and realizing that she smokes probably close to five times as much as me, because she’s home all day every day. We have also been having division of labor issues where I do all the house work and cleaning and cooking even though I am so much more busy with work and school. I am suspicious that the amount of weed she smokes is contributing to her depression, lack of motivation, and lack of helping around the house. Also, I am personally going to try to cut back, and start saving weed for special occasions because I’m not a fan of how I feel when I smoke every day. 

We are both at our respective homes for thanksgiving, where weed is legal, but I drove here while she flew so I would be able to bring some back and she wouldn’t. She told me before she left that I should try to get some. But I’m sick of spending so much money on it, and I feel like I am enabling her issues by providing weed. What I am currently thinking is that I will just get a small amount for myself to enjoy as a special treat when I want to and tell her that I’m not going to help her get it or get it for her anymore. My brother is one of our usual hookups so I would be taking that away from her, but also she has a fake ID and could drive less than an hour from our town to get to a place where it is legal and buy some if she really wanted to. 

I am asking this question here because I think my roommate would be upset if I stopped sharing with her, and I want to know if I would have moral ground to stand on here.

469,ckhq4w,"AITA For Being Mad Someone Ate My Candy Okay, so this is from a while ago, like years and years ago, but it's always bugged me that my friend wrote it off. 

For some background info, when in eighth grade I was really tight with one of my teachers. He had a few favorite students that would do tasks for him throughout the year (i.e. straighten his desks, write the daily lesson plan on the board, etc). Anyways, at the end of the year he got all of the students that helped a large 5lb bag, so they weren't super cheap either.  I couldn't attend the last day of class so I got one of my friends to grab the bag from him for me. I didn't see her until about a week later when she told me that her and my other friend ate all of the candy. When I got upset, she told me it wasn't worth getting upset over because it was just a bag of candy and that she'd buy me another one. She never did. 

Was I the asshole for being mad? I felt bad after she told me it was ridiculous for me to be upset with her.

Last year I sat with a group of girls at lunch now I only sat there because I was trying to get closer with my crush and as a result became friends with her friends. One day my friend lets call her Momoe said that she was coming out as an asexual. My crush and the other girl immediately told her that they wouldn't judge her for it. Now I don't know if being asexual means making a decision to not have sex or if it means they don't feel any sexual urges. Well she made it sound like she never gets any sexual urges and I personally didn't believe that. Now it is also my belief that if something doesn't affect me I should just stay out of it since it probably wouldn't be my place to tell them what they are. So I remain quiet and just sit there. I also never try to act like I care when I really don't. She notices I am not saying anything so she asks what I think.

471,apt8pf,"AITA For refusing to pick my ex up in his car because I need it for my Valentine's date. Back story:

My ex and I are still living together, divorce pending. He works away most of the week and I have the car. We only have one car because of the fact he was always away and it seemed pointless to have two cars. Since we broke up I've picked him up from 15 minutes away or 1 hour away, once or twice a week (UK so this is a long distance for us) and taken him back at sometimes 5am in the morning if he comes home mid-week. This is so that I can have the car.

Issue:

He is of the opinion I shouldn't make plans on Thursday (valentines) because he needs picking up.

It is his car (which technically it is) however, and here's the kicker, he wants to buy our house (joint names atm). I can't get a car because his credit will be affected. So, I am unable to get a car until that is sorted. It's valentines and I have a date 50 minutes away, my date hs only just started driving like two weeks ago and doesn't feel comfortable driving that far yet which is understandable. I have to leave before he gets home to avoid evening traffic, so I can't pick him up beforehand (which I have explained to my ex and he just gets annoyed).

My ex can have his father pick him up (15 minutes away) he's retired but has recently has gallstones and I know my ex doesn't want to bother him but there is also a taxi option. My ex will not use the car Thursday night he'll go home and play Xbox, (he doesn't need/won't use the car).

Additionally, when he comes home on a weekend so Friday and Saturday this weekend, he will take the car and not consult me on it at all. It leaves me stranded in a city with dire public transportation or taxis(expensive) which I have never bitched about. I get it, it's his car but I made plans and he has alternative options for this one night.

EDIT: Our finances were joint, my money went into that car too, it's just his name on the title and he's keeping it in the divorce.

They will talk right over you if you say something they don’t care about. They’ll answer with “Oh. Cool...ANYWAYS-“
They brow beat you into sharing the same opinion. I’m not even talking about politics, I mean like if they think green is an ugly color, that’s now fact and no one’s to hint otherwise.

The peak came when me and Cinder were talking about our planned halloween costume. We were going to be Beast and Belle.

Ariel begins berating us because ‘Beauty and the Beast’ promotes beast**lity and it reminds of her furry ex-boyfriend...I’m not joking.

She told us we weren’t allowed to dress up like them. *Not that we weren’t allowed to talk about it*, that we straight up were not allowed to do it.

Understandably, me and Cinder were upset and told them to fuck off.
The car ride home I kept telling Cinder how controlling and manipulative these people were. She agreed and said she’d never talk to them again, but then got a phone call from *guess who*.
Aurora screaming that she needed to come apologize RIGHT!! NOW!!
Cinder did. Sobbing, she apologized for everything. It fucking hurt to see. 

4 weeks have gone by since then and I can tell they told Cinder not to talk to me anymore.
We went from talking every day to once a week. 

When she does, the subject is quickly turned to crying about what The Princesses did to her that week.

I love her and I know they are controlling her, but I’m tired of showing her all the signs of abuse and she hides it under the rug. I always want to be there for my friends, to be the shoulder to cry on, but its tiring when she won’t listen. She’ll keep letting the cycle continue.

Would I be the Asshole if I told her to stop complaining about her abusers to me?"
473,aqb2s3,"AITA for ""Training"" my roommate? A year ago when I moved in, my roommate, who is also one of my best friends, was an absolute complete disgusting slob. Never cleaned up after himself, whole house smelled like mold and cigarettes, walls FILTHY with grime and nicotine. He looked and dressed in a way that made him look as though he did not live inside. He acted like a fool in public, yelling obscenities even on public transportation. At first, it was a minor inconvenience, but after time it started to wear on me. A month or so in, I started letting him know that I didn't want our friendship to be impacted by our roommate situation, and I could use help maintaining the apartment's cleanliness, which he essentially ignored until I had a breakdown about the communal areas being absolutely filthy to the point I couldn't bring anyone over without cleaning for several hours.

I have since been rewarding his good behavior with dab oil (we're in WA state, totally legal) and hot fresh meals, since I know he hates cooking. When he trashes a room and leaves it that way, I just ignore his mess and keep cleaning my own, while making food simply for myself. Once he's cleaned, I make a nice big communal meal for the both of us, almost always complete with fresh baked desserts. While he's in the shower, I drive to the dispensary for oil and dab out when he's done. I even slip his bus fare back into his change from food stores when he's not paying attention, if he hasn't been cursing and obnoxious on the bus (I drive a motorcycle). This has changed him immensely, and I have not once mentioned this sort of conditioning to him. He's never asked me about it either. He has also consistently smoked outside since I told him how much the smell affected me.

Am I an asshole for subtly using psychological tactics and essentially training my roommate to act and BE better? He's noted a vast improvement in his psychiatric health since I moved in, and I am loathe to tell him I've been training him to be a better roommate as it may come off as harsh.

Edit: a few words  
Edit 2:    I was in a bind upon move-in. I had just previously been through an eviction that was the fault of an aggressive former roomate punching holes in the walls during fights with his girlfriend. Not my fault, except for picking a bad roommate. Had I not moved in when I did, I would have ended up homeless during the winter, which wouldn't have been acceptable to me."
474,dnwu2x,"AITA for hating the proposal AND the ring? (23F) (23M) Posting from a throwaway because my fiancé uses Reddit. I knew I was going to get married to (23M) at some point due to immigration circumstances. We even called ourselves engaged even though he had never proposed. I am a very simple, no-frills type of person so this never bothered me.

--The Proposal--
I was proposed to this weekend in a way that I dreaded. It was an incredibly public, expensive and cringey moment, nothing resembling what I wanted at all. I would have loved to have been proposed to at home or on a hike together. Something free, private and meaningful. I still said yes because we had decided long ago to spend our life together.

--The Ring--
The ring is honestly ugly, it looks like something from Claire's even though I know he spent a lot of money on it. It's a custom rose-gold ring with an incredibly high setting. He said his mom picked it out, who I've only met twice. It's custom. Cannot be returned.

--The Aftermath--
The next day I sat him down and told him how I honestly felt. He was so offended that I didn't like the proposal or the ring. He called me spoiled. I told him I didn't even particularly want a diamond, something cheaper and simpler would have been delightful. 

He said he had never heard of anyone he knows getting the woman's input on an engagement ring. He said I made him feel like an asshole and told me to just take it off. 

Honestly, I just wanted something I would have been proud to wear for the rest of my life. I am a pragmatic person and would rather have had a low-key, private proposal coupled with a cheaper ring I love. I see the ring and I cringe at how embarrassing the proposal was and how ugly the ring is. 

AITA here? Am I being a spoiled brat like he says?"
475,a7327z,"AITA for taking a ""no"" at face value? This is a very silly matter, but I started feeling like I was an asshole and I want to be sure whether I was or wasn't.

I work at a civil court, which is basically office-work on a legal environment. As we approach our two week long Christmas Recess, lawyers gift us cheap stuff like pens or calendars as a form of showing goodwill. Every year, a particular firm gifts all female clerks cheap chocolate, and male clerks get cheap wine. Since I don't drink alcohol, I always trade my wine with someone's chocolate.

Last year, I traded mine with someone I don't particularly care about, and one of my coworkers who I mostly get along with was sad that I didn't trade with her. I told her, ""I promise next year I'll trade with you"". So, next year arrived and today we got the same cheap chocolates and wine once again. I went to the coworker I promised last year, and when I said ""so, shall we trade your chocolate for my wine"", she dryly answered ""no"", while looking at me as if it was offensive I even asked.

I thought nothing about it and traded the wine with the same person as last year, who was very happy about it (I think she's kind of a wino). I got my chocolate, she got her wine, everyone is happy, no assholes here, right? But suddenly, the coworker who said ""no"" comes to me and says ""I didn't realize you were talking about *that* wine. I do want to trade my chocolate!"", to which I replied ""I'm sorry, but since you said you didn't want to trade, I already traded with another person"".

She, a mid-forties woman, started to pout and say this wasn't fair. That I promised her we'd trade this year. That I should have waited to see if she really wanted instead of running off to trade with another person right away. Now I can hear her badmouthing me to other clerks who are her friends, and most seem to think this is incredibly silly. One of them even offered to buy her better wine, but she said it wasn't the same. She then put her chocolates on my desk and very loudly said I can keep them even though I gave her nothing.

I know I probably shouldn't feel guilty, but she made such a scene that I can't help but think it was assholish of me not waiting to see if she would change her mind (from the moment we got our gifts until I traded with the other person, it was about 10 minutes). The wine is worth, converting currency, $5. The chocolates are worth $2.

So, was I an asshole because I took her ""no"" at face value and didn't wait for a change of heart?"
476,ek691v,"AITA for not letting my boyfriend disclose my job/salary to his family and letting them think I’m a mooch. Me and my bf dated all throughout college. I got along with his family okay. I say “okay” because they always had trouble with my weight/personality (I’m thin, introverted. My bf is handsome, life-of-the-party type). They have basically been telling him he can “do better” our entire relationship. 

I graduated after my boyfriend and moved in with him (who was an engineer already living on his own). I had a spell of “unemployment”. Although, I was generating $$$ online- sometimes even more than my bf. I also used this time to deal with something personal. Of course, this whole time his family used my employment as something else to shit on me for. 

Well I eventually got a job- a great one. I told my boyfriend not to tell his family that I got an actual job unless they specifically ask him. I also told him not give details about my title or my salary (because I know they’re dying to know). “She works with electronics. She doesn’t want me to disclose her personal details” is basically what I told him to tell them. 

My boyfriend thinks I’m a major asshole for this, but I’m just done with his family at the moment. I spent so many years trying to please them, only to have them make me shed lots of tears. I know I can easily tell them what I do/how much I make, but it’s oddly satisfying having them think I mooch off my boyfriend, but then see what I’m doing on social media and thinking “wait how would they afford that?” (Yes my bf is an engineer, but this is in California lol. He can barely afford to live by himself.) 

BUT I also can see my boyfriend’s side of things. 
Would like to hear other opinions! Am I an asshole for this?

**edit:** I think I left out some important details! His family knows I work an actual job now. They found out about a month in when they asked my bf if “she found a job yet” and he said “yes” and then changed the subject. They just don’t know what I do/how much I make."
477,bv9176,"AITA for not wanting to miss important work event for specific parenting class I can take elsewhere? My wife is currently 8 months pregnant with our first child.  We decided to take parenting classes to prepare for our baby, taking a two day General info class and a separate breastfeeding class that we attended together.  I also signed myself up for a “New Dad” class that I was scheduled to take next weekend my myself that I signed up for in the beginning of April.

I however found out in the end of April that I have a pretty important event with work on the same day, same time.  This event has typically fallen on a Friday night, but this year it’s on Saturday afternoon, directly conflicting with this class.  When I learned about it (it was apparently in our school calendar most of the year but not discussed or disclosed aside from that, so my bad not learning about it earlier), I decided not to tell my wife about the conflict until I found another class to take so that I would present a problem, but then give the solution.

Finding this class was hard, as the entire hospital network in the major US city I live in only had New Dad classes happen once every 2-3 months, and I need to take it before the baby is due this summer.  With the next class well past the due date, I looked around and found “Boot Camp for New Dads” and managed to get into literally the only similar class I could find that wasn’t also on the same date and was even marked as booked online.  Basically, this process was time consuming and I got lucky to find another one.

I teach, and not only would it look pretty bad to not attend this school event this year like I do every year, but i feel it would look really shitty to the kids I teach.  Many of the kids I teach also have to attend the event for an important role, and it’s the kind of role that has been mandatory throughout the year.  I have had two kids I teach get out of work for the event and another push back her drivers ed final test by a few weeks to make it.  I feel that me missing this event when it is so important that my kids are there is extremely hypocritical.

After finding this other class, I tell my wife about everything a few days later.  She becomes livid because I am no longer taking the class from within the same hospital network as the other classes and where we will be going for the birth.  She also says that I don’t care about her or the baby and I don’t prioritize them.  She also is telling me that now she doesn’t want me to attend any class because she says I don’t care.  She is still really mad about this.  I know that I could have found this conflict back at the beginning of April but it wouldn’t change the situation.

TL;DR:  sign up for only new dad class at our hospital group.  Later learn I have a major work conflict that day and find a very similar/probably identical alternative outside of group.  Wife is livid because I can’t/won’t make it to the only class our hospital group offers.  She’s really angry and wants me to not go to any class now.

478,ch3vu7,"AITA for not moving off the couch as a guest at my parents? Hi, desperately need insight to this as I feel bewildered. Please give me insight, as I will be sharing the responses with family members. 

I am 25 F and have been staying at my parents for the past two weeks as I have been packing my old apartment to move to a new one and my place has zero AC. I make sure to contribute chore wise, feed myself and pay as needed where needed. Also the house is my parents, and sisters: 17F and 12F. 

Here is the situation: there is a routine that occurs at my parents that I was not savvy to until just now. Apparently when my dad comes home from work, the expectation is that whoever is on the couch sitting in “his” spot needs to move when he gets home so that he can lay down. The couch is a sectional that has a small chaise, a long section where you can lay down, and one spot in between where someone can sit. His spot is the long section where you can lay down. 

Now, since I am a guest I am trying to make sure I abide by guest rules, but feel absolutely bewildered by the expectation that you need to move from the spot on the couch when he enters the room. My reasoning is, I do not know whether he plans to sit in the spot or not and why move my spot on the couch if he isn’t even planning to sit down. If he wants the spot, he doesn’t even need to ask, simply tell me to move and I’ll gladly do it without hesitation. This is where my parents are saying IATA, because it’s their house and I should move as a guest to anticipate the owners potential desire.

Now, if my mom is sitting on the chaise part of the couch, and my dad enters the room and moves towards the couch,I anticipate he will want to sit down. Today’s debate was on the fact that no one was on the couch but me, he entered the room (which is an open concept living/dining/kitchen) and went to the kitchen to snack. Then went into the gaming room to hang out in there. Later, he said that I was in his spot on the couch so he couldn’t sit there which brought up this conversation about the unspoken rule to move. 

My parents stress that I need to add to this post to be unbiased that it is part of his routine to come home, use the bathroom, snack, and lay on the couch before dinner. However, my feedback is that in the two weeks I’ve been here, that routine has only happened maybe three to four times and it was times when I was not on the couch already. Their feedback was that the routine has not really had an opportunity to be shown as things have been slightly chaotic as we’ve been going out to eat right when he gets home or they go and do errands/activities. 

Basically, AITA for not following the unspoken routine of the house and automatically moving to another spot on the couch when he gets home in case he wants to sit there?

EDIT: I realized I left out a pretty vital point here, in that my dad didn’t really complain but mentioned he couldn’t sit on the couch as a side comment. My mom is the one who brought up the routine and the expectation that I move when he comes home."

Tldr: all the guys bathrooms at school were locked and I used the girls bathroom and got called a pervert

So it’s the senior’s last day of high school today, so they did this prank called “melon Monday”. All the seniors brought a watermelon to school and hid them around the school. A bunch of guys put them in toilets and smashed them so the deans decided to lock all the boys bathrooms. Well later I really had to go to the bathroom but it was locked and I had to go so bad. So I opened this one girl’s bathroom that only had two stalls and no one was in it, so I quickly went and left. anyways this group of seniors was standing in the hallway and saw me walking out of the bathroom and started pointing at me and the guys were saying “what are you doing perv” and all the girls were giggling and staring at me.

480,cj6q87,"AITA for intimidating another Driver who was road raging? This happened two days ago now. I wad taking my daughter out for a drive as she is working on getting up her hours while on her Learners Permit. Because of the incident my partner thinks I'm an asshole and shouldn't be the licensed supervisor when my Daughter is trying to get up her hours. Just to clarify my daughter is 16 while I am 34.

So on Saturday morning my daughter want to go for a drive. We live in Melbournes inner suburbs so I decided we should drive to my Parents house 2 hours away from where we are.

We stayed out there for a few hours before coming back in the early afternoon.

We were driving on one of the Major highways and our off-ramp was coming up. Problem was that there was another car sitting in my back a bit on our left. She headchecked a few times and saw him so she knew he was there. He was far enough back that she could comfortably change lanes.

So she does, as she is halfway across this driver speeds up, trying to cut her off perhaps. But he can't fit so he honks at her. This makes my daughter jump. But doesn't affect her too much. But it annoyed me.

I tell her to focus on the road, so the driver overtakes us on the right, drives past us and gives my daughter the finger. Now I'm pissed. I'm normally a happy go lucky guy, someone who is far more likely to be found fooling around than trying to be intimidating or angry.

He pulls infront of her and starts slowing down. My daughter is getting uncomfortable now. So I tell her to pull off to the side of the road. As she does this other driver does too. Now just to be clear, we have the yellow L plates up showing that she is a learner driver.

We pull over and stop the car, my daughter is shaking. The other driver gets out of his car, he is a shortish man. I stick my head out and ask what his problem is. He swears at me and calls me a cunt. I ask him again what his problem is and then ask why he is trying to intimidate a learner driver, let alone a teenage girl?

He swears at me some more. So I get out of the car and I think he he fairly well mouthed ""Holy Shit"".

Some more clarification, I'm a big guy. Not fat but I am, as my Basketball Coach said, Physically Huge. I'm 203.2cm or 6 foot 8 inches and I weight about 117kg which is 260lbs. Add to that I look like a Biker, as my daughter tells me, I have the beard, the short hair and a few tattoos on my arms.

He says sorry and gets in his car and drives off, well above the speed limit. I ask my daughter to switch seats with me and I take out the L plates before I drive us the 20 minutes home.

When we got back I told my partner who called me an asshole and told me that I should have called the police or taken over driving the car.

So, AITA? I will admit, I probably am, but this is my daughter we are talking about, no one gives her shit because she is my baby girl.

482,dxivfv,"AITA for going through my exchange students stuff? my sister and I for the past few months have been working on setting up a figurine shelf because she gets a lot of Harry Potter merchandise and I like to buy myself pusheen and anime figurines. it's in a noticeable spot \[you can see it in the kitchen, dining and lounge area\].

anyway, our school has an exchange program where students from Japan come down for the Australian holidays/Christmas time so my parents thought it would be the greatest idea ever and volunteered to be hosts. anyway, so the student came here and she was super nice despite not always understanding English and speaking it but we got past the language barrier most of the time. she had commented on the collection the second day in saying how she liked some of the anime characters that were there.

5th day in is where the problem occurs. in the morning as I'm eating breakfast I notice one of the figurines \[kirito\] missing \[it was pretty darn obvious considering it was both my favourite and a pair, [https://www.ebay.com/itm/SAO-Sword-Art-Online-alicization-EXQ-Figure-Kirito-Eugeo-set-Anime-JAPAN-2019-/264316802327](https://www.ebay.com/itm/SAO-Sword-Art-Online-alicization-EXQ-Figure-Kirito-Eugeo-set-Anime-JAPAN-2019-/264316802327) \]

I also looked at others to see if anyone else was missing, and there were, 3 mystery capsule mha characters. the only person I believed that could of taken them was, of course the exchange student. it wouldn't make sense if it was my sister, she never pulls pranks and my parents know not to touch our stuff and if they were planning to they'd tell us.

I faked sick for the day so that I'd be home alone since my dad was at work and my mum was going to be taking us out that day. when they were gone I went to the exchange students room and went through the cupboards and draws but also their luggage, in there bag I found all figurines and took them back. I also went out of my way to grab the rest of the stuff on the display shelf and put it in a box so they couldn't take anything else. in the process my dad got home, asked me what I was doing, told him the story and he said I should apologise for stealing from them even though I was technically taking back what was mine.

the only part that makes me wonder if I'm the asshole is going through their stuff without their permission. I put everything back the way it was but my dad also says I should've talked to her about it. 1- it's awkward enough confronting a thief 2- it's even more awkward when they may not understand you and can get away with lying.

485,blwxbw,"AITA for telling my friend that her approach to relationships seems unhealthy? A few nights ago, my close friend and I (both 22F) were having one of those deep, after midnight conversations and things got really tense. She’s sad about being single, but I think it’s because she’s has a weird approach to dating. She’s got a thing for Latino men, which is fine, but she’s gone overboard. She only wants to date native Spanish speakers (even though it’s not her first language, she only took it in college). She sets her dating apps by ethnicity so she only matches with Spanish speakers, calls them “Papí”, and insists on speaking broken Spanish to them when they all speak English and would rather save Spanish for being spoken at home. She has her ideal life planned out with a Hispanic man (she wants him to wear a sombrero to their wedding) and jokes about how she’s basically Latina (when she’s NOT, her family is from West Africa, so she’s just black) because she’s so “down with the culture”. 

I think she’s trying to be something she’s not (she has Spanish names picked out for her kids, insists on being called “Mariposa”, and seems to think that listening to Spanish music and eating South American food is enough to fully understand the culture).  I told her that just because she studied abroad for a semester does NOT mean that she gets the culture in the same way that someone who grew up there would, and that she should expand her dating pool to more ethnicities so she has a better chance of finding her soulmate. 

And she got really mad at me. She said that I don’t get it, that Latino men are more “machismo” and are “red-blooded male” and won’t consider dating outside of that ethnic group because she doesn’t like black men, doesn’t trust white men, and thinks Asian men are too “girly”. She felt like I don’t support her desire to learn Spanish (which isn’t true, I’m taking Spanish too) and it only got worse from there, when she asked me to be honest about whether or not she had a problem. 

 I straight up told her that I think her obsession is unhealthy. I also told her that she tends to move too fast in relationships (with her last one, she kept asking why he wouldn’t make her his girlfriend after 2 weeks, constantly accused him of seeing other women, and told him that she loved him— all within the first MONTH). She seems really eager to be attached to someone, and I told her that she should focus on getting to know people first and see if they’re a good match before demanding that they cuff her (the last guy left her because she kept pushing him). She said I was mean and that she already knew all of this, and I apologized and told her that “I love her and she’s one of my best friends and I’m sorry for upsetting her, but I only want what’s best for her and I just wanted to tell her what I saw”. And now she’s mad at me and won’t talk to me because she feels like I “threw all of this in her face”.

**TL;DR:** My friend has a Latino fetish and an unhealthy approach to relationships. I told her this and she says I went too far— AITA?"

He was free to say no if he wasn't able to come in but had never turned down hours before this. So I gave him a weeks notice that I wanted to take some me time in the evening and have a few drinks with a friend and that I would not be available that night to take him to work and begged him not to accept hours to witch he promised me he wouldn't. Fast forward to the night and just about 4 drinks in he walks in the door and demands that I take him to work in front of my friend and on of their mutual friends and starts chastising me for shirking off my responsibility of taking him to work and was saying that I was putting alcohol over him having success in his work place.

488,dsc5xp,"AITA for quitting the team after coach treat me like sh*t I 5'9 and weigh 180 pounds and a senior. I play QB, TE, and DL. Last summer I transfer to my new school where I was trying to be the starting QB. So during 7 on 7 I was the quarterback and I think I did decent but coach start treating me like shit. It wasn't until during actual football practice that coaches told me ""That I will never play QB for this team"". So I was force to be a tight end and defensive line. When I play TE people start treating me like shit. But when someone else play TE coaches help them with the plays but when I play TE coaches still cussing me out and told me to get back to the sideline. Other teammates treated me like shit so in turn I start talking sht about them and their pressed me and threaten me. I stop talking out of fear and continue my high school football career. On scout offense coach never let me in on Tight end cause their didn't believe in me and everytime I was on scout offense coaches told me to get my ass off. After many attempt I just give up and went on defense. I try playing DL and I been doing good such as getting sacks and being aggressive. But when a sophomore came over the coach KICKED me out saying ""I need to do better"" and replace me with a sophomore that was doing the EXACT SAME THING as me. This was the second to last straw. As weeks went by I became very unhappy that coach were always find other people over me. I got sick of tired of coach disrespect me. I just want a little respect for once. So when we were reviewing special teams one dude was absent during practice so I went to took that spot and the head coach was ""WHAT THE FCK HE DOING HERE GET YOUR ASS OUT"". Then he literary got a FRESHMAN to be on special team over me and at this point I haven't even play a SINGLE game and it my SENIOR year. I pay $300 in total, $200 in camp and $100 for my pay to play. My parents even cook meals for the coaches and parents. I was in tears when I couldn't get in so I threw my pads and cleats and just walk off the field. I quit because coaches treated me like sh8t. AITA."
489,cr0d5d,"AITA for creating a communal discord server because the owner of the current chat wanted to include everyone into our exclusive chat? Ok. A little backstory. In my school, I'm in a sort of ""friend group"". So one of my friends at the time had a good idea of making a discord server so we could all talk to each other easily out of school. NOTE THAT ONE OF THE RULES OF THE SERVER IS THAT THEY HAD TO BE IN OUR GRADE TO GET INTO THE SERVER. We got basically every one of our friends in there, and it was going smooth for about a year. Then, even though this server was supposed to be an exclusive server for just our friends and people in our grade, the owner started letting anyone in. This is people from different grades (which goes against the rules) and people we didn't even know. I thought this wasn't right as this was supposed to be just for people in our grade, its even in the owners own rules, and I wanted to keep it that way as there was already many people in the server. I brought up the issue, and we argued about it. Then eventually everyone came to an agreement that we create a different communal server for literally anyone to join, since the owner didn't want to leave anyone out. I took the responsibility of making this server, and then sent an invite to everyone from the original server. The owner of the original server then heard about all of this, and got instantly triggered. I'm talking swearing, yelling everything. She told me that I went behind her back, even though she said we should have a public server so no one gets left out. I was calmly handling the situation, I wasn't swearing, I wasn't insulting her, and I wasn't raising my voice one bit. Meanwhile, shes cussing me out, calling me stupid, yelling, everything. I eventually got fed up with her and just said f\*\*k you and left the server. Then, my friend told me she had also cursed out and insulted one of my nicest and purest friends ever. She always cared about everyone and made sure everyone was ok with people, and always talked to them if they needed someone to talk to. She insulted her so bad she started crying, and didn't respond to anyone's messages for like 1 hour. At this point, I had had enough. I tried to be mature and handle this with as well as I could, but she had taken this too far. She acted like I couldn't go and make a server on my own and she acted like she owned me and that she was the leader of everyone just because she was the creator of this one server. I told my friend to invite me back and i yelled at her and told her she never insults anyone like that, especially my sweet friend, and I told her she was being completely immature, outrageous, and unreasonable after I tried to work everything out the best i could. Am I the a\*\*hole for making this server ""behind her back"" and saying f\*\*k you after she was swearing at me for 15 minutes, and telling her she's immature for resorting to insults?"

me and my wife have just adopted 2 kids, a 4 month old and a 3 year old. they are brother and sister. 

throughout the adoption process some of my family acted strange, I always brushed it off and never cared to much but that was until an aunt showed me screenshots of a conversation that some of my family had in a group chat where they all agreed that adopted kids don't make a real family, one family member also threw in some not so nice homophobic comments (we are both females) 

the family members we decided to cut out where my other aunt, my mum and dad, my uncle, my nana and poppa, and 4 of my cousins. so a lot. 

I added them to a group chat and told them they are banned from seeing my future kids and I do not want to see them. 

I'm now feeling like crap and because its my mums first grandchild she has been messaging me non stop trying to apologize. 
most of the family I cut off have been doing the same, I now think I went to far because I've made almost all of my family mad at me. 
everyone I've spoken to has told me I went to far and now I'm overthinking everything.

491,daabfy,"AITA for not telling my Dad? AITA for not telling my dad?
Little bit of background information before we start, my parents got divorced when I was four. Both houses are drastically different. On my mother side it is very gaming oriented, things are pretty carefree apart from the occasional wash the dishes, clean room, etc. I have my dad’s house, things are very strict, there’s a lot of working and yard work. They are a little to no video games in the house, apart from a Nintendo Switch which has a 1 hour total play time limit (2 hours during weekends.)
I got a phone about a year ago, so I’m relatively new to the whole Reddit posting aspect. Please forgive me if I make any common mistakes. Also I’d like to clear up that I am 16 years old, and this is a pretty huge subject for me. My phone is an old iPhone SE, hand-me-down from my mom. It is not my dad’s, and he does not pay for it. My mom does. My dad went out of his way to put restrictions on the phone, giving me only two hours of Total game, entertainment, media, etc. for the whole day. I can ask for more time, but most of the time he does not give it to me as a “do not need it”.
I am an artist, and I enjoy drawing things but that doesn’t mean that I need references, and he is also blocked safari 100% of the time, making me have to ask him to use Safari to search things up for a very short period of time.
I recently got some time on the phone, he toggled Safari for my use, and he forgot to turn it off. 
AITA for not telling him? He’s very restrictive, and that I understand he has the best in mind for me. I grew up in a very LDS household, and I still believe that the teachings are true, but I feel as if this is a little too far. He should be able to trust me to do things on my own. He even has restrictions on Safari keeping me from looking at ‘dangerous websites’, which I am fine with and understand.
Should I tell him?"

493,8z8045,"AITAH for ending a Lyft ride early Ok, for context, this happened a few years ago, but I recently found this sub and was reminded of this little incident. 

I used to drive for Lyft, and when this incident happened, I had only had my car for a couple months at this point [2014 Honda Civic LX](https://i.imgur.com/yeV6CG0.jpg)

So it's about 10:30 in the evening on a Saturday night in downtown San Diego, and I get a request to pick somebody up. Upon arriving, 3 girls hop in and mention they are going home. Ok, they already put their destination address in the app, so I confirmed they were my fare, and off we went. 

Now, this particular drive required me to hop on the freeway for about maybe 10 minutes. I was driving along, and we were maybe about 2 miles from our exit, when I suddenly hear multiple clicking noises coming from the back seat. I look back, and one of them is trying to light a joint in my car!

I immediately ask her what she thinks she's doing, and she replies with ""Oh don't worry, I'll just blow the smoke out the window""

I respond with ""No, you do NOT light a joint or a cigarette in MY car, so please put it away""

She begins to get all huffy and asks me what my problem was. I simply told her either she puts it away, or they can get out of my car. She continues to complain, so I pull off the freeway, stop at a 7-11 and tell them all to get out, I'm ending the fare.

""You can't kick us out, we're paying you to take us home!""

""Uhh, I just ended your fare. You didn't want to put your joint away, so now you can find another ride.""

They continue to complain and refuse to get out until I finally say ""Look, if you won't get out of my car, then maybe we can let the police sort this out.""

At first they didn't believe me, but when I started dialing they got the hint and got out. 

Of course I received a call from Lyft the next morning asking why they had received a call complaining that I had kicked them out of the car before arriving then continued the fare. I explained that one of them tried lighting a joint in my car, and after telling them multiple times to put it away, they would not, so I dropped them off at a local 7-11, and had to threaten to get the cops involved to get them out of my car. 

The rep took a look at where I stopped the fare, saw it was at a 7-11 like I mentioned, apologized for them, and said they would remove the 1 star review from my record. 

Thinking about it years later, was I the asshole for kicking them out?"
494,860uku,"AITA for 'nagging' my boyfriend? **Background:** We have to have an engineer from the electric company visit this morning (any time between 8 AM and 12 PM), which has cost me £65 for the privilege. If this appointment is missed, it'll be another £65 to get another one. 

I can't be there this morning, on account of me having to work. I'd take the morning off if I could, but I can't. So it falls to my boyfriend to receive the engineer. He's not very good at waking up in the mornings, but I accidentally wake him up while I'm grabbing my clothes for work. He grumbles at me and rolls back over, as if going back to sleep. 

**The Incident:** I say ""Hey, if you wanna grab a few more minutes rest, that's fine, but don't forget you need to be up once I'm gone 'cos of--""

Then he cuts me off with ""F*ck's sake, [Me], I f*cking *know*, just f*ck off!""

I wasn't aggressive, and I don't think I came off as condescending. He clearly thought otherwise.

**My Perspective:** I'm willing to accept that I was 'nagging' rather than 'reminding'. I'm assuming he thought I was undermining his sense of responsibilty. 

My only issue with that is that history has shown that he *needs* me to nag him about responsibilities, or he simply won't do them. And then, if I haven't done everything to force him to do something, it's my fault that it hasn't been done. 

Example 1: When he was working, it would be my fault he was late if I didn't wake him up in time. Or if I did, and he fell back asleep once I'd left for my own job. The idea of setting an alarm himself was apparently impossible.

Example 2: He needed to see a dentist. We've recently moved, so I hadn't set us up with the local dentist yet. Mostly because they were only open during my work hours, and I haven't had chance to take leave to go sort it out. When I suggested he go set himself up with the dentist (he wasn't working by this point), he went off on me, saying that, since I was the reason we moved, everything was my responsibility to sort out. I had to take a longer lunch than I was allowed to sort it out the same day - fortunately my manager didn't notice. 

Example 3: He quit work because he wanted to go back into education. I've had to be the one to call the college and fill out his application. It's my fault the process has taken so long, but I was also a b*tch if I asked him to do some of these things himself.

I could go on, but I'm sure you get the gist. I'm honestly just sick of having to be the responsible one for literally everything, whilst still getting it in the neck for 'nagging' him when I try to remind him of things he won't take responsibility for on his own. At the same time, though, he makes me feel like such an asshole every time this happens. So maybe he's right and I should trust him to do things, despite his track record?

**TL;DR:** I 'nagged' my boyfriend by reminding him he had to be awake to receive a costly engineer visit. He made me feel like an asshole for this, even though he has a track record of failing to do things (and blaming me) when I *don't* remind him. AITA?"
495,acfps3,"AITA for letting my drunk friend walk home alone while I stay out at the bar? This has happened a couple of times with my friend and each time we have argued about who is in the wrong.

In this particular case me and my friend (F) went out to the bars with some other friends of ours. I'm having a great time, and my friend was too. 

Now my friend recently decided that she doesn't want to drink as much when she goes out, so she only had a couple drinks for the night. Her lack of drunked-ness coupled with her general dislike for ""partying"" as hard as me and the other people there made her want to tap out around 12:30 am or so.

She turns to me to say ""Hey, I think I'm going to go home."" I say something along the lines of ""Okay, see you later!"" I was having a blast and didn't want to leave so early.

She looks at me for a second, then heads out of the bar. I thought we were cool until the next morning and she tells me that I shouldn't have let her walk home alone. It is a long walk from the bar area to our place (maybe 20/30 min) , but she wasn't that drunk and I myself have made it home alone plenty of times before that, so I thought it was fine. I also mentioned that she could have taken an Uber if she was that scared to walk home alone, but she did make the fair point that it's a bummer to pay surge prices.

I just want to know once and for all if it's  an asshole move to let a friend (especially female friend) walk home alone?"

It consisted of yellow plaid flannel shirt unbuttoned, yellow t-shirt underneath, plain olive overcoat, dark jeans, and brown boots.  Upon arrival, a couple of the other girls made a big point of it to loudly tell me I looked nice and my girlfriend must've dressed me.  My gf and I are a fairly new couple and the others really don't see me enough to know how I dress.  Also, they rarely have much to say to me otherwise.  My gf tells me they were complimenting me.

498,d0sboo,"AITA for publicly arguing with my anti-vaccine friend? Some minor details changed.

I'm a physician's assistant, and I'm obviously very pro vaccine. Unfortunately, I grew up in a less than educated area. Religion and misinformation run high. I have a very old friend (Stacey) who lost a child coming up on two years now. This child died from SIDS the night after her two month vaccines. Sounds damning, but it's just not. It could have been anything.

Naturally, Stacey fell into anti-vaxxer bs because it was ""just too convenient"". She blames herself for 'not knowing better'. She is constantly saying and posting crazy things. She still seems to think that vaccines are good, but thinks there should be a much higher ""minimum age"", like school age. They've been trying for more children and it hasn't been going well. People in our hometown say that she can't have another child because God is punishing her/them for her ""failure"" the first time. Stacey was and is an atheist, but I do think misplaced guilt is more than getting to her. 

Her getting her child vaccinated was not the cause of death, and it's NOT some kind of karma that she can't just produce more children. The things she posts are crazy and dangerous, and it's leading people to make unsafe decisions. I've been commenting on her posts with facts when I have time. I don't want to see her inadvertently cause an epidemic just because she's sad. People are telling me that I don't understand what it's like and that I'm overstepping, but even beyond the amount of guilt she's unnecessarily putting on herself, this is a public safety issue."

501,cp0iy4,"AITA for quitting my old job without notice, and without transferring my responsibilities? 
I work at a job where I was harassed pretty badly by a senior engineer, it escalated till he groped me and I had to hitt him to stop it. And HR didn't handle it well. I filled a police report too but there wasn't enough evidence for the police or court to do much. My boss knew and he just towd the company line. My coworkers knew and thought it was funny, or thought I was being a crazy bitch. A couple other managers at work were creepy fuckers too, and HR just brushed everything under the rug

Thatt, plus some other experiences in my career, permanently put me off engineering and I decided to quietly work on transitioning to another career field. I started taking night classes, in accounting, passed my CPA exam, and got a job offer as an accountant halfway across the country. I kept all this quiet. 

It was just the type of new start I had needed. 

I was afraid of quitting my stable job and going into something totally new, across the country, with no support network, so I had an idea to cut down on some risk.

I told my engineering job I was taking the month of July off. And I told my accounting job that I was starting the first week of July. 

So for that month, I still technically had that engineering job to fall back on, just in case. But my new job was going wonderfully, and still is. So at the end of July, I sent an email to my old jobs HR department saying that I resign, effective immediately. I didn't say why, but I figure they knew why. They'd have to be dumb as bricks to not figure why.

I got an email back saying that I would need to come in to next day for the exit procedure of turning in my laptop, ID, company credit card and phone, filling out an exit survey, etc. Closing out loose ends and turning over my in-progress work to someone else. And I replied to  that to say that my laptop, phone, CC and ID were on my desk, and I would not be available to come to the office.

Since then, I've gotten a lot of emails asking me details about my work; procedures only I knew, where I had saved documents or work that I had in progress, etc. I haven't answered any.

I've been doing great; it's such a weight off my shoulders to be out of an environment that I always feel stressed and unsafe. And it's a little satisfying that my old co-workers, including the one who i went to the cops and hr about, missed a major deadline because they didn't have some of the knowledge or documents that only I had in that group.

But I feel like kind of a dick because there were a few kind people in my old team, and I guess my old boss wasn't too shitty; he just had his hands tied by company procedure.

502,bw4luh,"AITA for hounding my roommate about his diabetic cat? So we just recently moved in with a friend from Ohio. He is a very impulsive person and will constantly buy things, use them once or twice and then completely forget about them until someone brings it up. (Kayak, guitar and amp, random neon signs, subs for his car etc)

Example: my boyfriend loves to play guitar. I have never heard of RM being a guitar player and he’s never picked up his own more than once or twice and now that my boyfriend plays his, all of the sudden RM thinks he’s a musician too.

Anyways, RM just out of the blue got a cat a couple months ago because he was lonely. Never taken care of an animal a day in his life. He didn’t realize UNTIL WE MOVED IN that his litter box needs to be cleaned every other day, that the cat CONSTANTLY runs out of food and water when he isn’t home (I only realized since I’m home all day) and that his cat needs more attention than a couple pieces of kibble and a pat on the head. And it makes me mad when RM comes home and doesn’t even check the food or water. He either gets high and eats or goes to his room and sleeps. He even forgets to buy food!

Since we’ve been here we’ve been feeding him, making sure his water is full and giving him tons of love. Now he doesn’t leave our sides and doesn’t leave us alone.

One more thing is (after putting off the appointment three times) RM finally takes him to the vet to find out that he’s diabetic. The doctor gave strict instructions that the cat needs 1 shot every 12 hrs. (If given at 7am, must be given at 7pm etc,) Recently RM has been “forgetting to come home” and skipping the cat out on his insulin. This infuriates me.

Today he just so happened to barely get home at 9:30pm. He said he would give it to him now. Only problem is, he’ll need to give him insulin tomorrow at 9:30am as well. This won’t happen since he leaves the house everyday at 8am for work.

I’m not very confrontational (especially since we’re staying with him) and I know he’s not my cat but today I said a few words and made it clear that he needs to take better care of his cat and stay on his schedule.

AITA for hounding him about this stuff? My boyfriend and their mutual friend has been hounding him too. I just don’t know if I’m overreacting about it at all. I just don’t want this cat to suffer because of his owners ignorance."
503,eh7wj4,"AITA for keeping a painting my ex boyfriend made me when he wants it back? My boyfriend and I were together for almost 2 years. He had a minor in fine arts and on top of his job sold paintings part time. On my 24th birthday he gifted me a painting of me. It was kind of a whimsical surrealist type painting. It was very large (24 x 36) and I hung it up in my apartment and constantly got compliments on it. 

So 3 months ago I found out he was sending sexual messages to a girl on Instagram. I broke up with him despite him begging me to take him back for weeks. He eventually stopped contacting me and we went no contact for 2 months. Then 2 months later he messaged me asking me to return the painting he gave me. I said no since the picture was a gift. He insisted that I needed to give it back and that it took him forever to finish and that he wanted to sell it and that I should either give it back or buy it for $2,400. He said it was weird for me to keep such a personal gift. Again, I refused because it was gift and then blocked him in all formats.. He then started getting his friends to message me saying it was “messed up” that I wouldn’t give the painting back. I had to block all of them. 

I told this to my friends and although most of them were on my side some of them thought that maybe I should just give it back if it was so important to him and that when I start another relationship it would be weird to have a painting by an ex. 

However the painting is literally a picture of ME! I honestly don’t see how he’s entitled to it When he gave it to me as a gift. I haven’t harassed him for gifts I gave him.

504,ehezwg,"WIBTA if I cut off contact with my dad because of what he bought me for Christmas? Throwaway because I have IRL friends who reddit.

Some background on my father and I:

* He cheated on my mom when I was 2 years old. She divorced him.
* Made me feel like a guest whenever I was at his house. I never had a bedroom and always had to sleep on a sofa/pull-out
* Moved across the country to be with his new family
* Only came back to the state after he was sent to prison, released, and his wife divorced him
* Has forgotten my birthday multiple times
* His last birthday present to me (3 months late) was a broken, out of the box printer
* Never calls me unless he wants something, such as to clean his garage. I'm always the one to reach out.
* Wrote me out of his will
* Makes about $95k annually via pensions
* After necessities, should have about $45k remaining.
* Has a compulsive spending/shopping problem
* Leased a car for an ex-girlfriend
* Has 4 cars, none of which he can drive because he couldn't pay a speeding ticket.
* His bank accounts are constantly negative, getting overdraft fees, continuous OD fees, etc

I make $23k annually. I am also going to school full-time and paying for it myself. I also pay all my own bills. Needless to say, I'm not swimming in cash.

That brings us to today:

I went to my father's house today. I do Christmas Day with my mom's side of the family and was busy working the other days. I bough him a gift set including some tickets to an event I think he would really enjoy. It was only $50, so I had to put some thought into it, considering my limited budget.

As soon as I walked in, I saw there were boxes strewn everywhere: 2 TVs (which weren't in the house), an unassembled arcade cabinet, a stereo, digital camera, etc. Before I could even give him his gift, he wanted to put me to work assembling the arcade cabinet. I said I think we should do the gifts first, since I couldn't stay too long. I gave him his gift and he seemed excited. It was something he had wanted to see for awhile, but hadn't had the chance.

His gift for me? A $8 flashlight. I'm almost positive he forgot to buy me anything, because I looked up the store he bought it at and it comes in a 2pack. It wasn't even wrapped or in a gift bag. I saw the other one on his kitchen table. I thanked him for it anyway.

Unprompted, he said ""money is tight and that's all \[he\] could afford"". After seeing thousands of dollars in electronics he's bought for other people, it felt like a slap in the face. 

I probably should have said something and left then, but I helped him put the damn arcade cabinet together for about 20 minutes before I left. I didn't make up an excuse, I just said I had to leave.

This really feels like a ""straw that broke the camel's back"" situation, but I also feel like I may be an asshole for being ungrateful for getting a gift at all.

So, would I be the asshole if I cut contact with him over this?"
505,eoz02d,"AITA For Chatting With A Married Man Alone For So Long ? So last week something happened at my good friend's holiday party and I can't seem to get it off my mind. I need to know if I was the asshole.

I agreed to attend my good friend's work gala for the second year in a row. I had just gotten home from a two week long vacation the day previous and even though I was a little jet lagged, I was still excited to go.

The night of the event my friend and I agreed that I would get ready at his place. I brought over my stuff and when putting on my outfit, I realized that I might have gained a few lbs over the holidays / on my vacation because the dress fit a little tighter and shorter than I had initially realized. It was a tad out of my comfort zone of what I would normally wear to someone's work event but it was the only dress I bought and I had run out of time to go home and get something else.

When we arrived to the gala I saw some familiar faces. Two of those people being a couple that I met last year and had a great time chatting with. We all started talking in a group (me, my friends, his female coworker and her husband) and it was all laughs.

The husband proceeds to start telling me how him and his wife met; which ends up being a very long story. So long in fact, that his wife and my friends end up floating away from the conversation to mingle with other people. The story went on and on for maybe 20 minutes and every so often my friend and his coworker (the wife) would pop back around to comment on how we were still talking about the same thing (jokingly of course).

He finishes this long story and then asks some questions about me. Nothing off-putting or inappropriate but just allowing me to talk since he talked at me for like 20 mins. We end up having a great conversation for another 10- 15 mins. Then his wife walks up and things get awkward. She comes over and says to him that she's been on the dance floor and everyone is asking where he is - and it looks very embarrassing that he's outside chatting in the lobby area while shes inside the banquet hall. She then gives me a bit of an up and down, looks at him, and then proceeds to walk back into the room.

He starts to follow her in but says I should come along so we can continue our conversation. At this point I feel extremely shocked and very embarrassed that I might have caused a fight between this couple and/ or that other people from the event might have thought something other than a friendly conversation was happening between us. I didn't follow them in and actually avoided them as best I could for the night.

So I just need to know - was I unknowingly being the asshole for chatting with a married man for so long and should I have ended the conversation and walked away after a certain amount of time? Also was it because of the outfit I had on that made things look worse than it really was? I'm not sure what the subliminal etiquette in the situation should have been but I feel like I got it very wrong."
506,egxff3,"AITA for calling my MIL a ""pathetic desperate leech of a person""? My (40M) wife (39F) and I have been together since our teen years, we had a baby very young too (she was 16) 


My wife was raised by abusive adoptive parents.

My wife was always desperate to find her mother and at the age of 19 she did, when MIL came around she wouldn't acknowledge we had a child and would guilt my wife into going drinking.

MIL was quick to admit that she gave my wife up because she (MIL) was adopted,  she admitted that my wife's father had wanted to keep her.

MIL stayed around for a year and would always borrow money or talk down upon me and my wife, MIL eventually cut contact.

MIL recently reappeared in our lives, messaging our eldest child to try to get to my wife.

MIL got in contact with my wife and continued contact with my son, then she stopped contact for 7 months.

My wife recently posted about how difficult it was growing up as an adopted child.

MIL popped up telling my wife she didn't appreciate it and overall laying into my wife about how shitty the post was (the post wasnt about MIL it was about  her  upbringing)

I told MIL to stop being such a pathetic leech of a person and to back the fuck off.


My son thinks I was a bit strong and that MIL is trying to be a good parent, shes obviously gonna feel bad about the post my wife made.

507,bnwcgx,"AITA for still refusing to speak to my cousin? Growing up I used to look up to my older cousins, I still do except for the cousin in question who we’ll call DF (dickface). He used to be really cool until he swallowed the red pill. Now, I don’t care about people’s political views, support who you want, just don’t be a dick about it.

Anyways, during the Australian gay marriage plebiscite, our family group chat full of extended family were weighing in their opinions. My family is pretty conservative, except for a few people, and the conservative side had some pretty gross things to say, and some non conservatives ended up leaving. Everyone was pretty pissed off about it, but DF was even more pissed. He was talking shit, saying they left because they can’t defend their arguments, when really they left because they would rather just avoid conflict. Anyways, I stepped in and told them that I’ll be voting yes for gay marriage because I believe that everyone should have the right to marry whoever they want as long as they’re both consenting human adults.

Well DF didn’t agree, kept trying to argue and when I ignored him he kept indirectly mocking me, it was obvious but when I’d call him out he’d say that I’m being crazy because he never mentioned names and that I should stop being obsessed with him.

The day the yes vote won was the day the shit hit the fan. I decided I wasn’t going to talk about it because I didn’t want to rub it in their faces, my family were pretty upset, but DF was being his usual self. He was posting articles of yes voters being assholes and vandalising churches and such, telling me that this is what I voted for, and that I’m siding with kiddy fiddlers and all this disgusting crap, I’ve had enough so I fought back and he kept berating me, calling me a retard and then telling me that my family doesn’t care about me because if they did they’d step in and tell me to stfu. My siblings stepped in and basically told him to get fucked, I’m perfectly capable of fighting my own battles and how dare he say they don’t care about me.

I haven’t spoken to him since, I left the group chat because I’m done with him. My eldest sister is also done with him, but she still says hi and bye to him to keep the peace, my second eldest sister and her husband are all buddy buddy with him, and the rest of my siblings are cool with him. I don’t care about any of their relationships with him, at the end of the day he is still our cousin and I don’t expect them to shun him out. However, some of my siblings and my mum think I should stop shunning him because he’s made the effort to say hi, or merry Christmas, or happy Easter and all that crap, I told them that if he put the effort in to apologise then maybe I’ll consider acknowledging him.

Now I’m wondering if I really am taking this too far, I don’t think I have anything to apologise for but maybe I do. Should I apologise? Should I accept that he never will and bury the hatchet?"
508,bjnagt,"AITA for cutting my mom out during a difficult time in her life? As some background, I’m 22 year old soon to be 23 in 2 weeks female. Growing up my mom wasn’t horrible, but she wasn’t the best either yet we were close. Everything changed when I turned 18. I moved 11 hours away and after a year I decided to move to the state in which my dad lives, because I didn’t see him a lot growing up. My mom was furious and has been manipulative, controlling and shit talking my dad ever since. Often times our phone calls end with me in tears and then we don’t talk for weeks.
 
At one point during a depressive episode of mine she even convinced me to fly to visit her, then took my phone and said if I tried to leave she’d call the cops and have me put in a mental hospital. When I managed to escape, she called the police and tried to file a missing persons report and also tried to get my boyfriend at the time in trouble with his job for abusing me (he wasn’t)

We did not speak for a year and even after I forgave her things were rocky. Recently she let me know my grandma has lung cancer and probably won’t be around for more than 6 months. While I was sad I wasn’t as sad as most people would be. My relationship with my grandparents isn’t that great either. Their idea of love is tossing you a check your birthday and Christmas but never calling and I got tired of being the only one who cared to call.

My mom who lives far away wanted to know if she could come stay with me because my grandpa would not let her stay at their house but my mom still wanted to visit my grandma. (I live about 40 minutes from my grandparents) I reluctantly said yes, then a few weeks later said that my step dad and their dog would also be coming. I live in a 1 bed 1 bath apartment with 2 dogs of my own and my boyfriend so there was no room for that many visitors. On top of that, she asked to speak to my boyfriend and wound up over sharing with him about our family and even my relationship with my ex. When I told her to stop and that didn’t need to be discussed she got angry with me and we wound up arguing. Later she texted me telling me to never speak to  her again because I’m insensitive without a heart. This is not the first time she’s texted me something like that so I just blocked both her and my step dad. 
A few days ago my step dad made a Facebook page and messaged me telling me it’s nice that I’m only an hour away and won’t speak to my mother, so apparently they found somewhere else to stay but I didn’t know because I blocked them.

AITA for blocking them when my family is going through a hard time? My mom is crazy but I know she loves me and her own mom is dying. I feel very guilty but my mom has caused me a lot of stress and heartache and Idk if I can keep letting it happen. Should I suck it up this time because of my grandma ?"
509,bo2sno,"WIBTA if I tell my brother that he needs to stop drinking? Alcohol addiction runs in my family very heavily. My brother was a drug addict in his teen years, and has been clean from drugs for about two years. So, it's not like alcohol is a new experience, he's drank a lot too back then. He just turned 21 last month, and is CONSTANTLY drinking. He's treating it like it's a game and he thinks it's cool. My household consists of my grandmother, my brother, his girlfriend, and I. His girlfriend had expressed her concerns about him drinking before he turned 21, she asked him not to because her dad and her brother were alcoholics growing up and it was a very abusive situation for her. So he's been hiding alcohol outside, going out there, drinking until he's drunk, and he seems to think it makes him cool. All while she's asleep. He asked me to ""go walking with him"" last night, which is his code for go outside and keep him company while he gets drunk. I finally had enough of being around it, so I told him I wasn't going out there with him anymore. A few hours ago, he asked me how much vodka I think he should mix in his orange juice- and I told him that he doesn't have to drink EVERY other minute. Would it make me an asshole if I told him that it's aggravating?

I have depression, a host of anxiety disorders, and have had anorexia for a few years now (even being hospitalised on multiple ocassions) and watch cartoons/anime (particullary the cute/innocent ones somewhat meant for kids.) 

I have been doing this to cope with with things since i was first hospitalized at the age of 9ish (using pirating sites back then) and it built into a habit in order to deal with stress. 

My sister had been making fun of me for watching ""those purvy shows"" and had been calling me a lesbian when we live in a fundamal Christian household, so the aqusation could have serious consequences (i am a lesbian/atheist, either of which could get me kicked out of the house if i were to come out of the closet)

I changed my password so she couldn't watch her shows, and my parents are taking her side. She knows my mental problems and still mocks me saying that since she goes to school and works 25+ hours a week she deserves it. Keep in mind i go to high school, work almost 40 hours for $9/hour while she is a part-time collage student who gets paid $15/hour. 

AMTA here?

TLDR: sister uses my prime account, makes fun of me for watching anime to cope with mental problems and makes acusations that could get me kicked out of our fundamentally Christian house. Says she deserves my account since she workshard, but goes to school/work less but still makes more money than me. Everyone thinks I'm the bad guy in my family.

511,dlch6f,"WIBTA If I file a complaint about our maternity nurse? Wife gave birth to our first child last week, mom and baby are happy, healthy, doing great. 

The delivery mostly went very smooth, but some comments and reactions from the maternity nurse really rubbed me the wrong way. 

The thing is I’ve never been in a room where a baby is being delivered before so don’t know if my wife’s behavior was abnormal and the nurse was responding to that or if the nurse was out of line. 

For example my wife went in planning on an all natural birth and was really screaming through her contractions. At one point the nurse was doing something and said “Could you not scream *right* next to my ears?” 

When my wife and I first came in we were obviously very nervous and when the nurse went to insert some IV fluids the doctor decided she needed into her arm she pulled away at first and said “wait, what’s that, I’m doing this all natural. That’s written down somewhere right? I want to be sure everyone’s on the same page.” 

And she was definitely frantic and firm about it. But I figured she’d be cut some slack because she was in labor. But the nurse said (don’t remember exactly because I was a bit preoccupied) “Relax, it’s just IV fluids. I can read a chart too.” 

Then when my wife decided she wanted an epidural this same particular nurse said in a mocking tone “but I thought you were doing it all natural? Are we not *on the same page?*” I wanted to request she be rotated away from us but there was no opportunity to go discreetly talk to someone, I had to stay by my wife. 

I was going to have family say something but by the time my in-laws got there this nurse had gone off shift. 

Soon we had a baby and this was the last thing on my mind but it really rubbed me the wrong way and I brought it up with my wife today and she said “Oh I was so crazy, I don’t even remember what I said or did. It’s not worth calling. I wasn’t feeling very courteous.” But in my mind all pregnant women giving birth are kind of loud and frantic. 

So would I be the asshole if I complain about  her or was she just responding to the hostility in the room?"
512,9wv8xq,"AITA for hating it when people whisper? One of my [14F] absolute pet peeves is when people whisper in each others' ears while in a group setting. I've always found it extremely rude; if I have something to say, I'll say it for everyone to hear, but if it's personal, I'll discuss it with the involved party privately. Additionally, I was the victim of exclusion-based bullying two years ago, so it recalls the sense of panic I felt when my bully would badmouth me in my presence, but in a voice that was too low for me to discern exactly what she was saying. 


Recently, two of my friends have taken whispering to an extreme that is making me paranoid. I've told them about my issues with this kind of thing, and they've acknowledged them, but it doesn't seem like they're going to stop. They laugh, and when I ask what's so funny, they say it's nothing and share that secretive smile, and I start panicking. They've assured me time and time again that it's nothing about me, so I don't understand why they can't just say it aloud instead of taking each other to the side like a pair of mobsters discussing their latest hit.


Am I being too sensitive or are my concerns legitimate?


TL;DR - when my friends whisper, it brings back unpleasant memories of being bullied. I've asked them to stop but they continue to. Am I being unreasonable?"

Anyways, my fiancé found a nifty little rolling machine in the gas station yesterday, and bought it. Came out to the car and said “hey I found you something” and handed it to me. Walked off. It was super cute, I said thank you, blah blah blah. I don’t get gifts from him very often, so it made my heart happy, ya know? Anywho, at work last night, we were smoking and I was talking to our friend and said “yeah, he found me the coolest little machine today, should I go get it?”. Fiancé pipes up from the couch and in the nastiest tone says “I got that for you? I didn’t realize everything was yours.” People laughed, obviously thinking it was a joke. Another employee was like “lol women”. And I know it’s not that serious, but I felt so damn small in the moment. Like, even if it wasn’t for me, why call me out like that publicly? Why openly embarrass someone you love? And this isn’t the first time. It’s sort of become a habit? It’s almost like he doesn’t want people to know that...we care about each other? I brought it up this morning, and he seems to have no idea why I’m sad about it. It’s not about the “gift”. It’s the public humiliation. Every time I tried to explain it, he says it was a joke, no one was laughing at me, they were laughing at a joke. But.,.the joke was about me. Ergo, they were laughing at me. I think. Now he’s mad at me for crying about it. And in return, telling me every little wrong thing that I do, because god forbid he endures a two minute lecture without letting me know that I’m far from perfect. These are already things we’ve talked about and I’m avidly working on every day. So it sucks to have it thrown back in my face.

Oh, and we have a son so be nice the with “break up with him” line. I don’t like conflict.

Last ETA: I hope I haven’t painted him horribly. He’s an amazing guy and father 95% of the time. I’m waited on hand and foot, we do everything together, etc. our son is his world. Like I said, if you feel the age gap is relevant, sure. But don’t fixate on it."
514,aab2e8,"AITA for this situation with my roommate? My roommate and I share a very small room.

He goes to bed at 10 pm more or less, while I use to study at night and usually go to bed around 3 am.

He has a very light sleep and wakes up whenever I enter the room, even if I do my best not to make any noise.

If I have to use my phone in bed, even with the lowest brightness and an additional filtering app that makes text hard to read even for me, he wakes up and can't sleep because of the light, as dim as it is.

Of course he complains daily.

AITA for not going to bed earlier?
Imho, obviously, I'm not.
He accepted to share the room with another person and he can't expect me to accommodate his rhythms.
I'd understand if I ever made loud noise voluntarily, or, in general, actions that are supposed to make him wake up.
But if he suffers this condition (which I think it is, because it's not normal) I can't just disappear or sleep on the sofa.

515,eks3uk,"AITA for not hugging my mother? I know it is a weird title, but please hear me out.

I(15M), have not hugged my mother in like 2 years. She always acts upset about it, but I always thought she faked that. I found out I have Aspergers/ASD and that I don't understand emotions correctly because I don't experience them like most people do.

The reason I didn't hug her for that long is that she has called me fat and has been calling me out on that at what feels like every meal, especially around christmas. She always says it when she sees it, which is also the reason I am always anxious to brush my teeth and do basic hygiene when my mom is also in the bathroom. I always wait a bit and get irritated that it takes so long. 

During summer break last year I was with my dad in the house and my mother was still on vacation for one more week, and I realised I ate much less without her hanging around. We told this to her but despite that she still doesn't stop.

Not only that but I think she is also afraid to admit to the fact that my mind isn't like a normal person, because when I got the diagnosis she told me it was nothing, and she also does not even try to figure out exactly what ASD is.

I know it is her responsibility to watch out for my health, but I think she acts insensitive. I know I am overweight but I am working on it. The way she brings it to me already drove me to a short depression that resulted in me hating her back then and losing the habit of hugging her.

Please tell me how you all think about this because it has bothered me ever since. Am I the Asshole or is my mother?

My mom(A) is very skinny but thinks she’s super fat and always tells our family how gross and fat she looks. even though she is basically flesh and bones at this point. She doesn’t starve herself. she is naturally skinny and I got that from her as I am also super small. 

in recent years I (F16) have noticed A making more rude and obnoxious comments to my sister(F17) when she eats and how much she eats. She is chubby, not obese or even close. But she is above the average weight for her age. She tells me she’s happy with her body but i notice how insecure she gets eating around A. I could eat twice as much as her and get a “wow it’s amazing how much you can eat!” while she would get comments like “are you sure you wanna eat all that?” or “ that is full of calories and so bad for you” 

I could understand A is just looking out for my sister and doesn’t want her to get to a life risking weight as my mothers brother is obese, but she obviously doesn’t realize how my sister is comfortable with her current weight.

2 of them (guy,girl) have proven to be extremely unreliable in an alike manner. All the incidents Im gonna mention happened both individually and in a group setting, MANY times throughout 4-8 years.

Examples:  
\-Being late, CONSTANTLY, (over 40mins). And say say stuff like ""yeah i know im an asshole"" and thats it. No attempts to change it.

\-Making plans to meet and not showing up, without letting you know. You'd wait for them and they wouldnt show OR, they wouldnt even pick up the phone. And if you do reach them they'll be like ""oh yeah, i couldnt make it sorry"" (this one i REALLY cant wrap my head around. it takes little effort to text ""cant make it, sorry"")

\-Making me go to hospital (was urgent, but i was being an idiot) and promising they'll come with me and not picking up the phone the next day.

  
These are just some of the examples that keep repeating. there are many more, that made me realize that while they are good people they lack respect for anyone if they keep doing that stuff. 

long ago I had a crush on the guy and didnt act on it. Yesterday the girl asked why i never did anything about him.   
i gave her a vague response.

518,d1wsqm,"AITA for wanting to cut my brother out of my life? My little brother who is 5 years younger than me (I’m a 30 M), is taller, stronger and more aggressive than I am (for reference).

We have never really gotten along earlier in life but it got a little better once he went to college. He has had issues making friends and I felt sorry for him. But it was just until now that I realized why he doesn’t have any true friends.

He is overly aggressive about being the smartest guy in the room. Except he’s not always the smartest guy in the room.

When I help him with computer stuff (I’m a Sys admin and a Dev Ops kind of guy) he is always very impatient and wants things done fast or something done that’s impossible and then gets mad at me every step of the way. He can’t remember his own damn passwords to accounts. And when I apologized for maybe talking over what he could understand and just asked for patience. He told me to talk down on him again he dared.

So I calmly told him I didn’t appreciate his tone and he blew up and I told him that I’m done.

Not only am I done with helping him on these things. I’m done helping him in general, or even talking to him.

I’ve blocked his number and I blocked him on Facebook. I honestly don’t want to talk to him ever again because he only treats me like crap. Now I’m not perfect either but I have remorse and regret when I do something wrong. But with him nothing I do is the correct way he wants me to handle it.

Here’s the perfect example of what I mean. I was helping my in-laws a little with my sister-in-law’s wedding. Not doing anything too manual because I was suffering from C Diff at the time (don’t look it up, but just to put it in perspective I about had heart attack during the wedding reception being dehydrated and out of energy and having high anxiety and was in the ER for a night). The whole weekend he wouldn’t stop bugging me about his Xbox live account and not knowing the password and Gold expired and got mad when I wouldn’t help him because I was busy with other stuff. So he would cuss and scream at me for not making him my top priority.

So am I an asshole for doing this? Should I unblock him?

Edit: Spelling and grammar. Original typed this all up on mobile.

Edit 2: Thanks for all of the advice i really appreciate it. I posted this for insight and so that I wouldn’t just be discussing this between my wife and I so that people could call me out if I was taking a misstep and I have gotten a couple of PM’s as well. So again thank you.


If he really needs me he can contact our mom or our sister. I’m not abandoning him just making it a little harder for him to use me. I spoke with my mom earlier and she had stated he was treating her with zero respect as well. She also stated that he wouldn’t stop yelling at my dad. So we are all on the same page about his behavior.


And none of my actions on this are out of malice but mostly just trying something else for a change, it’s all out of the fact that he won’t listen to us when we try to help him but he yells at us no matter what so I hope that it helps him start to realize what he’s doing. I don’t want my brother to be lonely. I want him to finally find a girlfriend that respects him and friends that don’t turn on him. But in order for that to happen he has to respect others.


So the blocks are going to stay in place for now. Maybe I unblock him around the Holidays. Maybe if he offers a simple apology. And obviously if he’s in real danger or trouble I’ll be told by my mom or my sister and I will help out. But until then it’s radio silence."

523,buhten,"AITA for nearly calling the police on my sisters friend? This happened a few months back before I knew of this subreddit. The story often comes up and my sister insists she was in the right, while I feel otherwise. I figure this would be a good place to settle it.

My sister (20F) and I (22F) were home alone. I was in my room working on Photoshop with headphones on, and my sister was in the bathroom taking a shower. The bathroom is right next to my room so I could hear the shower running even over my music. I thought I could hear some weird sounds (like movement, shuffling) so I took off my headphones and that was when I heard it— someone opening the front door and closing it. The shower was still running, so I figured my sis was still in the shower. The way the house is laid out, I was able to slip out of my room and look around the corner to see who it was. 

It was some dude late 20s/early 30s that I've never seen before. I nearly pissed myself. I rushed back to my room, locked the door, texted my sister to lock the bathroom. I grabbed a weapon (or basically the only thing I had, which metal rod for my curtains) and was nearly going to call 911 when my sister got out of the shower and started yelling at me. It was her friend, apparently. She had got out of the shower (in her towel, leaving the water running) to let him in to grab a water bottle while he was on his way home down the street. 

I had a panic attack, ngl. I was crying, I yelled at my sister 1) because who is this older dude she's friends with? I've never seen him before 2) why wouldn't she tell me 3) for all he knew, she was home alone and she answered the door in a towel. She barely knew him. She told me she only met him the week prior. Who knows what he could have done. My sister has now never invited him back and rarely has friends over. She claims that I overreacted and made too many assumptions.

So, AITA? Did I overreact? Or would you have done the same?"
524,eirba7,"AITA for washing my husbands wallet, then leaving him home alone all day when he got mad? Major lurker here, I rarely post but this situation upset me a lot. My husband (35M) and I (33F) have 2 small children. We both work full time. I do majority of housework and childcare. My husband has a bad habit of missing the hamper with his dirty clothes, so I usually pick up whatever clothes he discarded on the floor the night before in the morning, and put them in the laundry room. This morning, I was up early and did just that, in the dark, because husband and our 3 month old were still asleep in the room. I started a load of laundry and went about my business. When my husband got up he asked me where the pants he was wearing last night were, and I told him in the washing machine. Now- I’ve washed his wallet before. I try to check pockets but with 2 kids and him there is a never ending mountain of laundry. I told him last time it happened his wallet is not my responsibility and he better empty his pockets at the end of the day, because I was absolutely not going to check pockets anymore. So, he is obviously pissed when he hears his pants are in the wash, and heads for the laundry room, muttering “are you fucking kidding me”, etc. Our older sons bedroom is across the hall, and I’m heading in there when I hear him mutter “You dumb bitch.” 
Me: “what did you say?”
Him: “you heard me. These pants weren’t in the hamper because I was going to wear them again! They were next to the hamper.”
Me: “are you kidding me?? You’re a fucking child. Pick up after yourself and take responsibility for your own crap”
We were planning to go to my dads for New Years Day dinner, so I packed up my boys and left him home, didn’t say another word to him. He texted me about 10 minutes after I left and said “would have been nice to spend the day with my family”.
I felt bad, but went to my dads anyway and had a nice day. I figured spending the day apart was better than continuing the argument in front of our kids. He’s now giving me the silent treatment. AITA?

EDIT: thanks to everyone who commented! I read them all, and it was very enlightening to get so many outside perspectives on this situation and the division of labor in my household. The husband will be doing his own laundry from now on, and less work for me is a happy ending!"
525,b7oeno,"AITA for what happened on this night out? This happened a while back, but we always bring it up and it always ends with people thinking different things for different reasons.

&#x200B;

I'd just come out of a relationship and was down the local pub with a friend, he was treating me for a night out to get my mind off it, anyway two 21 year old's in a pub is obviously going to get messy with drink which is exactly what happened, there was this woman who my friend really liked the look of, so I was doing the 'wingman' thing and talking to her friend and her friends husband to let my friend get to know the lass he wanted to better. 

&#x200B;

After about ten minutes he taps me on the shoulder and does the universal signal for drink, so he went up and started queuing, now this is when it gets to the conclusion.

&#x200B;

The woman he was talking to asked me if I wanted this drink she had that she didn't want, now I know there's all the safety posters about not drinking something you don't know about, but it was a free JD and Coke, so I had it, and we all started talking. Her friend and the husband went to the bar for their drinks then, so it was just me and the woman my friend was talking to, and before I knew it she was all over me, literally just on me. Then I heard my mate say something unflattering towards me to say the least.

&#x200B;

Last orders came and we never saw the two woman and the bloke again after that, but it's a common point people bring up whenever we go on a night out or have a few drinks at some point.

So basically, am I the asshole in this story or am I free of blame?"
526,dpoen7,"AITA for wanting my entire tax return for myself? Here is some context.  My husband and I still maintain separate bank accounts, while having 1 joint account for bills that we both put money into every pay, and 1 joint savings account.  We both put money into RRSP's, however his employer matches his RRSP contributions up to a certain amount every pay and his RRSP contributions are automatically taken out by his employer.  This also means that his employer does not tax him on his pay for the amount equal to his RRSP contributions.  Come tax time, he is usually more or less squared up even for taxes.  Myself, on the other hand, have to pay into my own RRSP account that my employer does not match.  This also means that I am taxed on my RRSP contributions and I get this tax money back as a tax return every year.

We submit our taxes together, however this year, he owed the government something like $150, while the government owed me over $2,000, so our combined tax return was like $1,850.  He thinks we should be splitting this return.  I do not think that would be fair.

I told him that since he already gets to see the fruits of his 'tax return' every paycheck by not paying taxes on his RRSPs, that the entire tax return should be mine to spend on whatever I want.  Why should I have have to pay taxes on something my husband doesn't, and then share that return?  The way I see it, he is benefiting off his company's policies on RRSP contributions.

TLDR; My husband essentially thinks it would be fair to keep his 'tax return' all to himself, and still get half of mine.  AITA for thinking this is unfair?"
527,d8ay88,"AITA for waking up my sister for snoring? My sister and I have been sharing the same room for basically my whole life now, and we’ve had some pretty big fights over the years and encountered another problem today.

My sister snores. Extremely loudly at that. I can’t fall asleep when there’s noise around me, never could and never will be, I tried multiple times (on planes, trains, etc) but to no avail.
Up until now whenever she went to bed earlier than me (which I try to avoid), I just wake her up by repeating her name a few times (she never wakes up fully) and she stops snoring for a few minutes, which essentially is my time window to fall asleep. She’s never protested thus far and can’t even remember me waking her up the next morning.

My sister has an internship for the month of september for which she needs to wake up at 7 a.m. in the morning and she’s someone who’s incredibly dependent on a full nights rest. I’ve been sick the last couple of days, and my headaches have made falling asleep that much harder. Yesterday she fell asleep and started snoring as per usual, so I just repeated her name to get her to wake up, which is when all hell broke loose. 

She was LIVID. She started screaming at me and told me how egoistic I was, how I didn’t respect her, how she couldn’t stop herself from snoring, etc. She was crying and went to sleep on the couch afterwards. She literally had a full mental breakdown. My parents then tried to comfort her (she tends to be a bit of a drama queen to be fair) and were mad at me for waking her up.

Now my mom expects me to apologise to her. I’ve stated my point and told her I wouldn’t apologise since I didn’t do anything wrong, to which she responded that it wasn’t about me being right or wrong, but to be ‘nice’ to my sister basically as she tends to overdramatizes most situations. 

AITA for waking her up?

EDIT: I’m younger by 2 years btw if that matters at all"
528,anu8h7,"AITA for getting annoyed with my friends for obsessing over Kpop? Some backstory:

My friend Anna (20F) and I (20F) have been best friends for 8 years and started liking Kpop 5 years ago or something like that. We were both around 15 when we started liking Exo but it only lasted half a year to a year for me because I just don't like obsessing over artists the way that I need to see every interview and every episode where they supposedly show their ""true self"". Fast forward a few years and our other friend Nicole (also 20F) joins us. Anna is still following EXO while I haven't been catching up with any news and only listened to like two songs or something. Anna started introducing us to BTS which was really fun at first and they are really good artists imo. 

 Onto the story:

1. Last summer we went to South Korea for Holiday (mainly because we were all pretty much still fans of BTS). It was really fun and we had a good time overall (no fights between each other or anything like that). So one time we were hanging out with our neighbours, drinking soju and eating some really good food, when I (pretty drunk) remembered how Anna told me that if you pronounce Joker a certain way it means Big Cock or something. Now me being drunk thought I'll pronounce it very carefully and obviously fucked it up, hence the two Korean boys couldn't stop laughing and it was pretty funny too. It's been more than 5 months since then and they still tell the story, even when non Kpop fans are present and then explain while the other people usually just look at them weirdly. 
2. There are no normal conversations with Nicole anymore. The only thing she talks about is Kpop and literally nothing else. She's not the most outgoing girl and that's fine and everything but then she starts saying she only wants a korean boyfriend and that she wants to live in South Korea (even though she's not even trying to study korean). I don't even like our ladies night we have anymore because we'll usually watch something funny or talk or whatever, but now it's just become this huge Kpop thing where we only watch Kpop videos, listen to Kpop music and if we're not doing that Anna and Nicole are trying to do the choreography (which is fine but please let's not do it at 3am). Even when other people are there Nicole still turns on Kpop and the videos.
3. Even in normal conversations in public spaces Nicole will randomly start dancing her favorite parts or respond in her few korean words that she knows. Whenever I say ""I don't know"" (which is kind of often tbh) she immediately responds with ""NAN MOLLA"" (""I don't know Nan molla"" are lyrics in a song) which was funny the first few times but she's been saying that for months now and it's getting pretty annoying tbh. 

I know I should say that it's bothering me and I've stirred conversations back to the topics again. To be fair I did tell them I'm just not that much into it anymore but maybe I should do it again? Like am I overreacting and just being overall to harsh?

Edit: fixed a word"
529,bim22u,"AITA for wanting to take a promotion my boyfriend doesn’t want me to? So long story short, I’m dating someone who has a daughter with another woman from a previous relationship. She lives in Washington state with their daughter; we live in Arizona. She had lived in Arizona but felt it was better for her to move to Washington state as that’s where she felt more comfortable. Right now, I am in a position where I could get a promotion in my job which would mean me having to live in a different area than my boyfriend. This obviously upsets him because he wants to be with me all the time but I didn’t see it as a big deal because the area isn’t that far away and we could still see each other on weekends and even sometimes during the week with the way our work schedules would be set up. He didn’t like that idea and thinks that I’m not “sacrificing” for him or “prioritizing” him like he has for me. And with that, he throws in my face that he could be living in Washington state seeing his daughter every day but chooses to stay in Arizona with me. Which I think is extremely unfair of him to say because I never asked him to do that. And I told him if he wants to live in Washington, he can. To which he responds “that’s not the point. the point is that you don’t prioritize me like i prioritize you.” Am I the asshole here? I honestly don’t know but he sure as hell is making me feel like I am. I want this promotion because I know I’ll be happy where I’ll be but if it really is selfish of me to take then I could just stay where I’m at. And accept that I’m the asshole."
530,emw2ij,"AITA for giving away a free Xbox One? For context, back about a year ago my wife came into possession of an Xbox One that was given to us for free. I was pretty stoked, as the console was in perfect condition and worked great. However, I noticed after a couple of months of playing on it that there were certain ""restrictions"" on the device. I was later told by my brother that this was because this particular Xbox was from another country, so I guess there are certain games it wouldn't play or even available for download because of regional restrictions. I am a just casual gamer and it played the couple of games I wanted on it without any problems, so this wasn't really an issue for me, and I didn't investigate if there was a way to remove these restrictions or anything.

Cut to a few weeks ago; my friend gifted me a newer, nicer Xbox with more storage and as a bonus, there were no regional restrictions on it. Cool. I later saw a single mom on an online Buy/Sell/Trade page that was hoping to find an affordable Xbox for her young kids for Christmas and I told her she could just have my spare Xbox for free. I wiped it, cleaned it off, and even threw in a controller and a few games. She was really grateful and I was happy to have it off my hands.

The problem is I never even thought to mention the area restrictions. I hadn't even remembered it HAD restrictions until after she messaged me upset the other day that the Xbox wasn't playing certain games. I apologized and explained that it hadn't crossed my mind because the Xbox always worked just fine for me and my needs, and she was more than welcome to return it to me if she didn't want it. She basically said that wasn't the point, the point was that it ""ruined"" her child's Christmas to receive an Xbox that wouldn't play certain games. I kindly told her that she could probably reach out to Microsoft troubleshooting and see if there was a way to remove the restrictions, and that - again - I was sorry, but really didn't know what else to tell her. I ended up having to block her after a while because based on our conversation, there was no way to rectify the situation in her eyes.

I thought I was doing a kind thing by offering her a free Xbox... but I'm starting to wonder AITA for not remembering to disclose the restrictions beforehand, thus ruining her child's Christmas present...? If she had known, she would have had the opportunity to turn the free device down and get one at full price. 

AITA?"
531,bctcg8,"AITA for hiring the daughter of the woman who is dating a mom-friend's ex-husband? It sounds ridiculous trying to explain it. Basically my 5 yo daughter befriended a 13 yo at a restaurant. Always on the look out for babysitters, I gave her my business card. I didn't realize at first that she was only 13, but when I did I figured maybe she could be a mother's helper, and after a few years could babysit on her own. When arranging a babysitting trial with the girl's mom, it became apparent that this girl's mom is dating the ex of my daughter's friends mom. NBD, we're all adults, so I keep the playdate and mom drops off daughter after church one day. In my perspective, it would be rude to say no--not to mention unfair to the 13 yo--and  cancel because of her mom's love life. At drop off it's a little awkward with mom, but more because she's just not someone I would normally hang out with. I explain everything to DD's friend's mom next time I see her, and it's more like, ""wow, strange how small the world is..."" But it's weird because she had never met this new gf. Anyway, I don't invite this mother's helper back because it's just not enough help to be worth the potential drama, and I wasn't really crazy about the mom, and that's the end of that interaction. 

Fast forward almost a year, and I get a an accusatory text message from DD's friend's mom about this random one time event. I offer to speak on the phone with her, but she keeps texting me things like, ""you never told me you invited her to babysit,"" ""I thought we were friends, so I think it's weird you'd have her babysit when you know how things are with my ex."" First of all, I did tell her. It's possible she misunderstood, but there was full disclosure on my part. And tbh, I'm not sure if I really think of her as a friend? I never hang out with her, it's always drop-off play dates, and I never text her with anything no related to our daughters. (And seriously, I would never be friends with someone who over reacts like this and would blow up a hypothetical friendship over this, especially when I've offered to babysit and watch both our girls whenever she has to work late or when there's no school). But I can't help feel like I did something wrong, when I pretty much have a completely clear conscience. 

AITA for inviting the daughter of the woman who is dating the ex-husband of a not close mom-friend to be a mother's helper one time last year.

If it matters, I had only known the (not a) mom-friend for 6 months and I didn't know how f-ed up her relationship with her ex was a them. 

TL/DR: Last year I hired a mother's helper who turned out to be the daughter of a mom-friend's ex husband's new girlfriend. Mom-friend claims I never told her (I did) and is now mad at me because I didn't cancel playdate after I realized the girl was the daughter of the woman dating my mom-friend's exhusband that she has never met."
532,es6oiz,"AITA - Boyfriend planned anniversary but instead based the entire day around his friend's party Hello Reddit,

I've been reading this sub for months now and I have been debating for a long time if I should post about this specific situation.

This happened months ago and I'm curious about people's opinions on the matter. My boyfriend and I celebrated our anniversary this past summer and he told me for weeks that he had something amazing planned.

Our anniversary rolls around, he comes to my house, I gift him his anniversary presents, and after he opened all his gifts he announces that none of my gifts have arrived because he ordered them just a few days ago. Okay... I'm a little bit disappointed but today can still be enjoyable. 

We drive to this little petting zoo near where we leave (it's about an hour drive), I'm expecting us to spend all-day here; looking at animals, seeing an animal show, order and eat some treats, etc. We spend maybe 40 minutes to an hour there, the second we buy some treats, my boyfriend grabs my hand and basically rushes me out of the building. The second we walk out of the building, he calls his friend and tells them that we will be at his house in a bit. I had no idea what he was talking about, he told me that his friend was having a party at his house and that we were invited. Now it made sense why we rushed out of the petting zoo because he wanted to get to this party. We arrive at the party, it's a total sausage fest (I was the only girl there). I basically sat at my boyfriend's friend's house for five hours while my boyfriend drank and hung out with his friends. He had a lovely time. I talked to people and tried to enjoy myself, I tried my very best to hide my irritably. 

After spending more than half my day at my boyfriend's friend's house, we get into my car and I tell him that I don't appreciate being told for weeks that something big was planned for our anniversary, we spend less than an hour at the petting zoo and I basically watched him have fun with his friends for five hours while I just sat there. My boyfriend said he thought I would have enjoyed the party because I got to see people I haven't seen in awhile (I've met these people maybe three times). He apologized for what happened, but he hasn't really done anything to make it up to me. (I know how terribly spoiled I sound)

So AITA for being upset for what happened on my anniversary?

Edit 1: It was our one year anniversary. I told him it wasn't necessary to celebrate our anniversary but he really wanted to.

Edit 2: Also, we are in our early twenties.

Edit 3: I didn't want to do anything big (maybe cook each other dinner and watch a movie) but he insisted he had something planned - he didn't tell me what it was. However, when our anniversary rolled around he said we were going to the petting zoo and then dinner, and he wanted to make the day special. But but he ate so much food at his friend's house that he didn't want to go out for dinner anymore. He was also too drunk, so when we got back to my house - he just fell asleep.

Edit 4: The gifts did come in - they came two to three months later."
533,bpuwgl,"WIBTA for Dumping a Depressed Friend even though He’s Sorry for Everything he Put Me Through TL;DR: My close friend was going through depression and, because I wanted to boost my marks for law school and out of my own ignorance, I didn’t reach out to him and I didn’t notice (I just thought that he was stressed). I began to help him a whole lot more after he told me what he’s been through but at a cost of my own physical and mental health (and physical/emotional comfort). He is very sorry for what he did to me and what he put me through but I’m not too sure if I want to remain close friends with him after everything that has happened.

It’s a very long story but the basic gist is that my close friend got really upset with me for not helping him out in his classes and being ungrateful for his help (while also not reaching out to him as he was going through depression) even though I’m in my last few years before graduating and really, really need to increase my GPA in order to get into law school and familial pressure. So I needed to focus on my own problems before helping him out.

At first, after he told me about his feelings, I felt guilty and wanted to making things right so I helped him a lot but at a cost of studying for my exam studying time; however, eventually, he expected me to do a whole lot more than a friend would do - and a lot of things I’m not physically comfortable with (e.g.: hold his hands/hug him since he really wants a relationship, get him food/drinks when he looks hungry - but with his money, be physically next to him all the time while on campus, etc.). And doing all of this made me feel like doing a chore and even more physically and emotionally uncomfortable when he told me that he confessed his “(familial) love” and sees me as his only close friend and family (even though I see just as a friend and no more than that).

I know he’s been through a whole lot of shit and contemplated a couple of things I rather not mention and I wanted to help him but this emotional dependence is taking a huge toll on me physically and emotionally (I’ve gained a lot of weight, been sleeping less and less each day, been more irritable, and physically want to puke when he’s around) and I have my own insecurities and shit to deal with. 

A few weeks ago, he apologised for making these demands (I kind of felt pressured and forced to do this due to feeling guilty) and wants to make things normal between us.

While I do want to forgive him for everything he’s done, he made me doubt my own identity and I feel that my relationship with everybody is more strained than usual. I felt that I’ve become a worse person ever since this happened. And I’m not too sure if I want to forgive him (or remain close friends with him) due to everything he’s done to me (and everything I’ve tried to do to reach out to him) even though he’s very sorry for everything he did."
534,b2by2c,"AITA for getting a meth head fired from work? I work at Sonic, so there’s lots of teens that work there, with the youngest people being 15. I’m 18 so I’m an adult and I work during the mornings/day. This Sonic is extremely close to my house, it’s less than a three minute walk and I live in town homes so I basically consider it part of my neighborhood. 

There was this new manager there that no one liked, she was rude and condescending to all the other employees. Another manager claimed she saw her smoking meth in her car in the parking lot. The girl already had previous trouble with heroin and lost custody of one her her kids because of it. 

One morning she came to work high on something, she was completely gray and vomiting everywhere and she could barely stand up. She slept through her whole shift and we notified the GM and he didn’t care. He didn’t think it was a big deal that she was high on hard drugs at work and doing them in the parking lot. 

On Saturday she was supposed to open but never showed up, the GM was unconcerned and so I notified the store supervisor about her drug use and she came in and fired the meth head on the spot. 

The GM was very upset with me, and so was the assistant manager. I told them I was thinking of all the 15 and 16 year olds that work at sonic and I didn’t want them to exposed to that kind of drug use. Sonic is also really close to my house and I live in a good neighborhood and I really didn’t want a meth user near it honestly. There’s lots of young kids and couples in my neighborhood. 

They told me the meth head got evicted from her house and lost custody of her other kid and they feel like I’m kicking her when she’s down. They were so upset that they suspended me from work for a week (it’s okay though because I was already quitting). I didn’t know she got evicted or lost custody before I reported her and now I feel kind of bad. I still feel like she shouldn’t have been working high though. Who’s the asshole?"
535,cuuyot,"AITA for not being considerate of my roommate's girlfriend when she's over? My roommate's girlfriend stays the night 1-2 times per week.  Usually she comes in the evening, stays over, and then he leaves for work early in the A.M. while she kind of stays and leaves when she pleases.  Or she stays until he gets home and they spend some more time together.

So he usually leaves for work at around 5:00am, while I get up at around 6-6:30am and make my breakfast and start my day.  His girlfriend usually sleeps until like 10-11am, so I'm up doing stuff while she's still sleeping.  

Since she's been staying over, I've received numerous texts from him while he's at work about how I need to be quieter while making breakfast because she's still sleeping, how I need to remember to put the toilet seat down for her, and that I'm being too loud in the morning.  I'll wake up, 'be too loud', she'll text him to complain and he'll text me.  It's ridiculous.

I'm not banging pots and pans trying to ruin her sleep.  I'm simply going about my day.  If I'm listening to music or watching Netflix on my phone, I use headphones.  It's a small apartment with paper-thin walls so I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do..  Wait 5 hours until she wakes up before I do anything? 

**My thoughts on this issue are as follows:**  She doesn't live here and has never once actually talked TO ME about these things.  She'll simply text her boyfriend and he'll send long texts about how he's 'told me many times'.  Honestly, I don't care how she feels.  She can put the toilet seat down herself. (I've received a few long messages about how I 'once again forgot to put the toilet seat down').  I live here and pay rent and if she doesn't like it she can go home (She drives to and from.  She's free to leave whenever).  But he seems to think that he's justified in his complaints about me not tip-toeing around her while she's over.  IMO he needs to just tell her straight up that she has no right to complain about these things.

AITA?

**EDIT** Okay guys, I'll put the damn toilet seat down.  And the lid.  But it's because I want to.

**EDIT #2** Alright it looks like we're kind of torn between putting it down and leaving it up, for a variety of reasons ranging from *""She's a strong independent woman""* to *""poop particles EVERYWHERE!""*.  This is getting interesting.

**EDIT #3** Thanks for the responses.  I read them all and learned a lot about bathroom cleanliness above all else, and going forward I will put the toilet seat down habitually, both so that the poop particles don't get everywhere and because it just looks more aesthetically pleasing to walk into a bathroom with a closed lid.  Yes, ***a closed lid***.  Ladies (and gentlemen, but especially ladies), observe the status of the toilet seat before you squat to avoid either falling in, or sitting on a closed toilet seat lid.  Anyway, this was a journey and a half.  Furthermore, I'll speak up and tell it like it is next time I get complained to about my conduct in my own place.  Consider this a successful Reddit thread.  And if I had a dollar for every upvote this thread got, I'd still be in shitloads of debt.

You're beautiful.  All of you.  Peace."
536,bwkzce,"AITA for wanting my gift back? So I dated this coworker(I know, I know), for a few months during the winter. Christmas was coming, I’m a handy guy, and she’s conceited. What better gift than a handmade lit vanity? It was perfect. Big mirror, lights all around it exactly like something she’s always wanted. Christmas comes and she’s in love. So proud of her new gift. Then she gives me mine. A nascar driving experience at the Kentucky speedway. Wow. Very expensive and thoughtful gift. I’m a car guy, and this was up my alley. The soonest she could get a date was June. No problem. I can wait. Well, as dating coworkers go, it went south. But we left on decent terms I’d say. 
A few months go by and just checking on the status she asks if I’m still interested in using my gift, I say absolutely! She nods and says she’d still like to go. I said of course, you paid for it! Fast forward a couple more months to today. I get a reminder it’s this weekend. I see her and say, hey that thing is this weekend if you still wanna come watch? She gets quiet and doesn’t say much. 
After work she messages me and tells me I have some nerve for asking about my gift. She tells me she’s passed it on to someone else to enjoy. I say well that’s a bummer, but am I able to get the vanity I built back? (I’ve had a lot of interest in them and have made a few more for others) I’d like to sell it if I can? She says absolutely not and blocks my number. I just feel like if I can’t enjoy the gift you gave me anymore, you shouldn’t enjoy the gift I made you anymore. Am I the asshole?

537,enh8yk,"WIBTA if I keep asking my mom for the money that I lended her even if she keeps telling me that “she doesn’t have money” every time I ask her? When I went into college I was getting financial aid. I was getting my money in checks due to me being a minor with no state ID causing me to not being able to open a bank account. So my mom went with me to go cash one of my checks and she asked me for $60 saying that it was for my stepdad to get him out of the hospital yet again due to his stupidity of drug abuse. This was like the billionth time that he’s gone into the hospital for drug reasons and he’s always in bad shape but just goes back to using after being bailed out of the hospital. 

I was really iffy about lending her the money cause I just KNEW he was going to go back to the meth use but she’s my mother and I gave it to her and told her to just pay me back later. 

A week later i asked her when she would pay me and she told me that “oh I thought you gave it to me out of kindness “. I felt kinda bad but I said no and she said she would pay me back the following week. She kept saying that over and over. 

So I moved in with my sister in another city and I asked my mom for the money and she only gave me $20 cause “she doesn’t have money”. Now I actually really need the money cause I can’t find a job. I keep applying but it’s so hard to get a job here. 

I asked her for the money once more but she keeps saying that “she doesn’t have money”. (She doesn’t work). 

WIBTA if I kept pushing her and asking her for my money? 

Tl;Dr: lended mom $60 for my stepdad to get out of hospital due to drug abuse. She has only paid me $20 and I keep asking her for my money but she doesn’t give it to me cause she “never has money” I need it due to being short on money and no luck on finding a job."
538,ctrzd9,"AITA for telling on my disrespectful drug addict roommate? So before anything I think I should give you guys some context. 

So around 7 months ago I moved in to a new house with 2 other friends because of college, now we already knew each others behavior and habits before we moved in because we lived together in a college residence hall. Now, my first roomie is great he is clean, respectful and also my best friend, the second roomie was also the same, but with a difference, he smoked pot regularly. 

Before we moved in into this new house he used to smoke 2 a week, thats why we thought it wouldnt be a big deal, and we even talked to him about not abusing weed or otherwise we would kick him out.

So after we moved in, this guys starts smoking more and more, from smoking 3 times every week, to smoking everyday, to smoking everyday, all day, and around the third month he starts bringing in his junkie friends to smoke with him, making the whole house reek of weed all the while blasting music at full volume basically making finishing schoolwork nearly impossible, not to mention that he became super dirty at this point.

We tried telling him to cut his drug use a thousand times but he won't listen, and after having a few intense fights I just had enough of it.

So our school conducts random drug tests, however you can actually tip of the school for drug use anonymously, if you test positive they wont expel you, but they will call your parents and force you to see a therapist.

After I submitted my tip and 5 days later my roommate comes home extra worried and starts telling us how they selected him for a random drug test, how his parents threatened to make him come home.

He is now clean as a nun but now his parents send him wayy less money (he can barely afford to eat now) and I in some way feel a bit guilty.

539,b15pjb,"AITA for being this mad that my gf is a picky eater? Gf and I have been dating for about 5 months now.  It’s been going pretty great for the most part.  I definitely see a future with her.  

Last night we both drove down so I could introduce her to my mother.  I was crazy nervous for it to go well.  The plan was to go there introduce them and then all go out to Olive Garden.  

When we got there everything went well until I asked my mom if she was ready to go eat.  She said she had a surprise for me.  She had made my favorite meal for me with plenty of sides and dessert.   There was so much food.  It was really sweet. 

My gf is a little picky about what she eats.  We went to sit down and she just outright says, “I don’t like any of this kind of stuff.  I’m going to Grubhub Olive Garden.  What’s the address here?”

There were so many options and she didn’t even bother to try anything.  My mom didn’t say anything, but knowing her it definitely hurt her feelings.  I was livid on the inside about how rude it was, but didn’t say anything about it.  Gave her the address so she could order and was mostly quiet the rest of the night.  Gf seemed oblivious to how rude it was.  

Since then the most I’ve said to her about it is that she could have at least tried some things and if she really couldn’t stomach it then order delivery.  She just doesn’t get it though.  She says she knows what she likes and shouldn’t have to eat what she doesn’t.  It wouldn’t have killed her to at least try something when my mother obviously worked so hard on everything.  

I’m still mad at her about it.  


Edit:  Holy shit this blew up.   I don’t have time to read or respond to everything before heading out to work, but I’d like to respond to a few that I’ve read.  

I don’t think this was some “power move” by my mom.  That’s just not her.  I think some of you have some weird family dynamics that someone cooking all day is some invisible slight to you.  I really think my mom just wanted to give my gf a taste of my childhood.  

I called my mom after I dropped gf off to apologize and my mom completely brushed it off and said that it gives her a chance to learn how to cook chicken Alfredo (what gf ordered) for our next visit.

540,ero44o,"AITA for saying hi on the phone? I (16F) work as a waitress at a restaraunt. I was closing , so doing some cleaning, with my coworkers and we were chatting. My coworker/friend (19m) always talks abt his girl and how much he likes her and shit, and he picked up a phone call and told us to be quiet because it was her. Naturally we started teasing him, and he yelled to not say anything, so as a tease I said “hi (name)!” 

Let me tell y’all he got BEYOND pissed. Angriest I’ve ever seen him, and he has a pretty short fuse. Like cussed me out (why the fuck did you do that, harsh names and such) stormed over and clocked out, and stormed out the door and went home. As in he was so pissed at me he clocked out of work just so he wouldn’t have to see me. I was super confused and my other coworker told me that he probably thought that his girl would think he was cheating on her. I personally find that ridiculous and have never been in a relationship where that would be the case. 

So AITA?? I felt pretty awful seeing how upset he is because I would never want to violate his trust or create a conflict, however, I felt his temper tantrum was a bit of an overreaction. AITA?"
541,dhtvn7,"AITA For being ‘relieved’ at my Grans passing? My gran had been in more or less a vegetable state for 3 years following a fall she had. She was in hospital for 12 weeks and this basically drove her insane and amplified her Parkinson’s to the point where she couldn’t even speak or open her eyes. Imagine that, every day for 3 years. 

Anyway, 2 months ago today she passed away peacefully in her sleep surrounded by my mother, my two aunties and my uncle. After the dust settled a bit I discussed it with my family and described my emotions as feeling ‘relieved’ to which they were disgusted. I tried to explain I only meant it in the sense that she was no longer suffering and my mother was no longer having to have extended time off work to help care for her (adding to her stress). None of my family could understand this concept and now they think I’m extremely selfish and hollow. 

I understand they are all still very emotional and sensitive to the topic but I don’t think that makes me an asshole as they’re making out. My sister won’t speak to me until I’ve apologised to Mum and my mum herself has just been very off with me. AITA?"

Me and my cousin clean the living room and kitchen, and in return she makes dinner. She is infamous and admits to not making dinner at all. Two nights ago I asked what was for dinner and she said to figure it out so I made a sandwich and hot pocket, last night she bought a pizza. I got home from school today and cleaned my portion of the chores (the kitchen), when she got home from work I asked her what was for dinner and she said she was having drinks and watching a football game with her coworkers. I asked if I could go because I had been asking to go to that place for a while and she had always put me off. She said something like “it’s adults night out. I can’t deal with kids right now” and told me to go back to my room. I even offered to pay for myself with money I got from additional chores and she denied me.

543,9te0gp,"AITA for wanting to hang out with my ex gf's dad? I dated a girl for two years. We lived together one. We both exercised a lot and had many things in common. We talked about and agreed on marriage and kids and our future. I always had a great relationship with her family and especially her father. We are very similar and handy individuals. I would get a lot of housework and financial advice from him throughout the relationship. He owned the house we lived in and did not charge us rent. He is a great guy and I feel like I owe a lot of my success to him. 

I graduated with my bachelor's and started my first ""big boy"" job. With the commute I was gone anywhere from 10-13 hours a day. I would come home exhausted and plop on the couch. I gained 10-15 lbs in 10 months. Occasionally I would help with dinner but for the most part, that fell on her (one of her complaints during the breakup). She was training for a half iron man and was dedicating a lot of time to that (1-3 workouts 7 days a week). We both stopped putting effort into the relationship. When we realized it, I wanted to work things out, she did not want to put any effort into it (her words). A month prior I had asked her dads permission to marry his daughter (he gave his blessing and we both got a little emotional) and I started looking at rings. 

After the break up, I was so heartbroken I quit my job and moved everything from FL to IN back with my family. I really needed the love and support from friends and family. While I was moving out, her dad was visiting. He even helped me move my stuff into the Uhual. As I was leaving, he walked me out to my vehicle and we hugged and we both cried a little bit. We agreed to keep in touch. 

We have emailed a few times and kept in touch like we agreed over the past couple months (breakup was in August '18). In the last email, he let me know he would be dog sitting for my ex during the week I will be visiting FL. I suggested we get dinner and he agreed. I texted my ex to ask her to give the clothes I forgot to her dad so he could bring them to dinner (we have texted periodically since the breakup about nothing important, sometimes she would initiate, sometime me). She went off on me and told me I am not allowed to be friends with her family or her dad. She said ""Maybe you should consider my feelings before you make plans that violate them"". She believes I will create a wedge between her and her dad (she also believes I created a wedge between her and her best friends because I talked to her best friends' husbands during the breakup, (whole other story)). I know she is extra stressed at this time with work, but am I the asshole for wanting to hang out with her dad? "

My ex and I broke up a few weeks ago after I caught her planning to cheat on me with her ex and also flirting with a few other guys on facebook.  Well shortly before the breakup two of her friends asked me to look at a phone and laptop that weren't working.  I work in IT so this type of request is common for me.  I said I'd take a look, but before that happened the breakup occurred.

Well these friends obviously sided with my ex after the breakup and publicly stated that I was overreacting and was more at fault than ex in the breakup.  Well the next day I returned the devices to those two explaining that I wasn't going to fix them.  Since then I've gotten numerous messages from them, my ex, and a few mutual friends telling me that I am being petty and childish and needlessly punishing them for my ex's behavior.  A few have also said I am obligated to help since I promised to look at them and the breakup doesn't absolve me of that responsibility.

I personally think this is all bullshit, but the fact that so many people are coming after me on this is making me doubt myself.  Was I the asshole here?"

546,b4bjhk,"AITA for using my own car and not putting gas in it? I apologize as I am writing this on my phone.

So my brother’s car is currently down due to unknown issues, and he’s been using my car (a 1999 Mercury Mystique) while I am unemployed, and although I don’t 100% agree with how he treats my car (leaving messes and trash, smoking cigarettes and weed inside) I still allow him to use my car.

Well yesterday and today I needed to use my car  for some errands and I noticed he has left the gas drop to the 1/4th mark in the tank, and the driving I did was not much at all, maybe 20 - 25 minutes on the road at most, used maybe a smidge of the gas as my car does not use much gas at all, and I decided not to put any gas in it as it wasn’t much used 

Fast forward about 6 hours after I return home and my brother left for work already my mother gets a message from my brother complaining that I am inconsiderate about others, that he had to go out of his way to go get gas while on his way to work (he leaves about 20 minutes before he has to be there for a 20-30 minute drive depending on the traffic) and that I would be the reason if he would get fired for being late. But despite his threats I honestly feel no guilt, as he knew I had to use my car and he was who left the gas so low. 

But I guess I’ll let you guys tell me, Am I the asshole?"
547,bugici,"AITA for stopping my sister from ordering dessert? My family are on holiday at the moment, at an all-inclusive resort.

Last night at dinner, my sister ordered food for the entire table to share (7 people in total). It's hard to describe the sheer amount of food she ordered so I'll attempt to list what I can remember:
• 3 large portions of fried rice
• 3 large portions of noodles
• 3 large portions of vegetable curry
• 3 portions of tuna carpaccio
• 2 large salads
• 7 soups
• 12 portions of fish
• 2 lamb shanks
• 1 osso buco

As she was ordering, the waiter told her there was already a lot of food coming already, but she ignored him and continued to add to the order. My brother and I also tried to tell her to reduce the order but she insisted that the portions were small, and refused to remove anything from the order. 

Once the food started arriving, it was clear that we had ordered way too much. We couldn't finish the first few dishes and left half the fried rice and almost all the noodles. As the food was arriving and despite not being able to finish what was already in front of us, my sister was still continuing to look through the menu and add to the order at this point.

By the end of dinner, we had 6 main portions completely untouched (6 fish, 2 lamb shanks, 1 osso buco and 1 salad), plus the rice and noodles we were unable to finish from earlier.

My husband and I were absolutely horrified by the amount of food that was going to waste. My sister has always been greedy and wasteful with food but the all-inclusive resort seems to have brought out the worst in her, as she can order anything she wants and it is ""free"".

At the end of dinner, she wanted to order tiramisu for dessert. Nobody else on the table could eat any more at this point but she insisted she wanted to order 1 portion just to try it. I told her that we had already ordered way too much food that had gone to waste, so she shouldn't order dessert.

My sister blew up at me and accused me of ""judging"" her, and said that she didn't know the portion sizes and it was the restaurant's fault for serving such large dishes. Which was untrue because we have already been here for 3 nights and were aware of the portion sizes, and earlier the waiter tried to warn her she was over ordering.

My sister now isn't talking to me and some of my family think I shouldn't have said anything, as it's caused an argument and spoiled our holiday. But I felt I had to say something as I was so angry about all the food waste.

So, AITA?

Update: We just went to dinner again tonight and this time everyone ordered their own food, and we didn't let her order any extra food to share for the table. Everyone had a great time and we finished everything that we ordered!"
548,egu9xa,"AITA for lying about my engagement ring? Was having lunch with my group of friends and the server asked me about my ring saying she loves how dainty it looks. She asked what size it was because she was looking for similar because she is also a studying to be a nurse and she said she can’t wear gloves over a large ring.
I’m fine with telling people because I have small hands and fine with my diamond size. I told her it’s a quarter of a carat. 
Everyone goes about my business until one of my friends says I shouldn’t lie about the size if I’m proud of it. 
The diamond is technically .21 carats. 
She was the one who went shopping with my now husband when he picked it and she’s salty that he went with that size against her opinion because he couldn’t afford more. Especially compared to her 1.3 carat.
I told her I’m not lying I just don’t know what to call .21 carats.

I have no issue saying .21 carats but it sounds weird so I say a quarter carat and round up. How do you round down? I wouldn’t mind that either because I honestly don’t care but for arguments sake wanted to know someone else’s opinion.

Edit. Did not realize .21 sound be called a fifth of a carat. From now on I’ll refer to it as a fifth."
549,bbajpw,"AITA For Having My Housemate Evicted? So my landlord has given me free range of who I pick as a housemate, and in return I get a discount on rent. It wasn't the smartest idea, but I originally decided to just pick the first okay person I could find on Craigslist for a housemate. The girl I chose seemed nice enough at first, she just was not very talkative. 

From day one, she was very hard to communicate with. On the initial move-in day, I was waiting for her to arrive to give her the keys and everything. She had me up until nearly midnight waiting for her because she was ""hanging with friends"". I eventually told her to just come tomorrow. Then we had a plumbing issue which caused the whole laundry room to flood. Rather than telling me about it when it happened or just cleaning it up, she left the room a flooded mess for two days. I told her that is this stuff ever happens again to just let me know. I just cleaned it myself to avoid any hassle. 

As you could guess, she's also not super clean. I rarely go to the downstairs to her living room, but when I do there is food everywhere and this one box full of trash. Again, we had a plumbing issue that caused the sewage to come back up through the shower drain. Once the issue was fixed, rather than cleaning the shower out, she just used it like normal???!  You can tell because there was still sewage traces everywhere besides where you stand in the shower. It was disgusting!!  This plus the fact she never communicates, never responds to my texts when I ask questions about the house, and overall is just downright stressful to deal with, I asked my Landlord to serve her 30 day notice. 

I feel bad because we live in a community where affordable housing is very difficult to come by. She's been a pain,but never has been outright rude to me. I also didn't really give her a formal warning, I just went straight to kicking her out. Am I being a jerk here? 

Tldr: My roommate is very messy and continually doesn't communicate with me, so I got my Landlord to evict her. AITA?"
550,dl0c80,"AITA for freaking out at my dad? For some context: I've been having a really hard time with my job. It's my first job out of school, and while it pays okay, I wouldn't be able to afford to live on my own and pay back my student loans. My parents have agreed to let me stay with them until I'm in a better place financially.

Despite being a ""full-time, regular"" office job, my hours are really variable. I spend around 50% of the time on the road meeting various clients and will have virtual meetings / calls any time from 6:30 AM to 10:30 PM. I regularly work 60+ hours a week, not including cross-country or out-of-country travel. I'm ashamed to admit I've sometimes, very late at night (think midnight, 1am, 2am) broken down and cried at my desk. I've been applying for other jobs, and have a few interviews lined up, but it's been a difficult and long process.

I try my best to still get to my office to take all these calls, regardless of the hour, but this morning I was feeling so run-down that I worked from home. At 7:55 AM, I go downstairs to grab my mouse and to ask my dad if he can play his guitar in the basement today as I have a call in 5 minutes. He tells me no, and that I should just take my call upstairs in my room. I say that I \*am\* taking the call in my room, but I can still very clearly hear the guitar through my closed door, which means so can the people on the call. He starts shouting that no, this is his house, he doesn't have to do anything he doesn't want to, and why can't I just take the call upstairs. Again, I'm ashamed to admit I teared up at this point and raised my voice to say that I AM talking my call upstairs, but I can still hear it and can he PLEASE just go play in the basement for 30 minutes.  He screams that I'm ungrateful and that I'm being selfish for not going upstairs and that if I don't appreciate staying home rent free then I can just leave.

At this point I was so stressed and so frustrated because he clearly was not listening to me that I just left the room while telling my mom to ""deal with him please I can't take this right now"".

I overheard my mom telling him to just go downstairs, and he did, and I took my call okay, but I can't tell if I really was being ungrateful. I know that the stress of my job has made me more sensitive than I normally am, but I still think I wasn't out of line here. Can you provide any insight? AITA?"
551,dvubja,"AITA for making my ex pay her share? I see in the rules that breakups are not allowed but mine is not entirely focused on that. We are in the post stages of the breakup and I am trying to resolve issues like what happens to the lease on our house we are renting. 

Backstory, she was going to school to be a lawyer and held an executive position in her job. I was military living in Oklahoma working on getting my foot in the door with a 3 letter agency. She moved from California to live with me in Oklahoma, and continued school out there. 1 year later, she gives me an ultimatum to leave my career and move to California saying it was a worthless career, I did. We sign a lease on a house and move out here. I paid the rent without income for a few months before my GI bill kicked in. 2 months into living here she tells me she wants to be a traffic cop, and leaves her executive job while still finishing law school. I was honest with her, told her that I felt she was selling herself short. 1 month later shes back living with her parents, and I'm on the opposite side of the country from mine (Florida). That's the backstory, its needed. 

We broke up in August, its now November, my school semester ends in a month and I just want to go home. I've been trying to resolve things with her, but its like trying to work with a brick wall. We still have the lease on this house, and whenever I bring it up I just get yelled at. I'm past the end of my rope...I draft up all the money it would cost to break the lease and its like 7.5k. I also figure out how much money she still owes me for helping pay her tuition in Cali and how much I spent on rent without income(Was a verbal agreement between us, Id support her until she graduates, then we switch) and the total comes out to 19k. I show her it saying ""You want out, you can't just walk out. We had an agreement."" and show her the total. She calls it extortion and walks away. 

I thought about it and figured the rent portion was never going to be achievable without sacrificing more mental health and time away from family. So, I reached out and said to forget the rent, just break the lease and that will be fine. Here's the AITA part, am I an asshole for demanding that she pay? I tried to work things out but she avoids it like the plague. Alternatively, I could just pack up and leave her to pay the rent on the house?"
552,eu3hqz,"AITA for cleaning my car's windshield? So I pulled into a big gas station that is half truck stop, on the cars half. I park at a pump in front with an empty spot behind me. There are some other customers but it's not crazy busy. I go inside and use the john and get some coffee, then come back out to pump gas. 

Now there's a large Winnebago towing a pickup in the pump spot behind me. Guy in the driver seat looks to be waiting for his wife. I start the pump and wash the outside of the windshield. Then I get to cleaning the inside of the windshield because it's almost sunset and I'm headed west, the inside glass was a total mess. 

Now Winnebago dude comes over and literally says, and I quote, ""You know you're the biggest asshole here? Cleaning your windshield, and now you're gonna clean your glass? I can't believe this s***"" To which my response was basically that there were plenty of other spots, even ones where he could have pulled through without backing up that difficult rig. Also, he chose to pull in behind a car that had no one in it and could've been there for a while.

After some more moaning he went away, I finished my cleaning (not too hastily) and went on my way.

Technically I did already make it up to this friend last week 1 on 1 and celebrated with her, but I still would like to see my other friends and celebrate. My boyfriend gets really bad acid reflux due to a condition called gerd. He knows that pepperoni and pizza sauce trigger it more so than other foods. Last night he didn’t want to spend money on dinner so instead made a frozen pepperoni pizza that we happened to have in the freezer. Well he spent all night waking up in pain and then had to call off work today because he can’t stop vomiting. Overall, he’s feeling pretty miserable, which I sympathize with and feel very bad he’s hurting. However, I told him I’d take care of him when I get home following the dinner (have to head there directly from work). He responds how he’ll probably be sleeping by then and doesn’t need anyone to take care of him. He then follows up with “if you were feeling this way you would not be ok with me going out” to which I responded not if you already had plans. Also, tbh even if something came up last minute I would never tell him I need him to stay here and take care of me unless I legit needed someone there because I was immobile. Now he won’t respond to any of my texts and is ignoring me. He has me contemplating canceling with my friends, but I don’t really want to and think he’s being a little overdramatic.

My mom has lots of tattoos. Yesterday she mentioned getting mine on her forearm. I have no idea if she was joking or not, but I freaked out and got pissed. I do NOT want a matching tattoo with her, especially not a tattoo that's so distinct. 

She habitually copies me in general and it's annoying. But I feel as though a tattoo is taking it way too far. I don't even have a particularly great relationship with her, definitely not to the point where I'd want matching tattoos.

I feel like it's hugely inappropriate to match tattoos with someone against their will, but I don't know if it's really such a big deal or if I'm overreacting."

So, I had just arrived back from London at 09:30pm, drove from Winchester to pick her up in Salisbury to then drop her off in Portsmouth where she works during the week, journey was a nightmare and extended about 40 minutes on the journey due to road closures. We arrived at 11:40pm. I then was going to drive back to where I work in Winchester as I had an early start and would arrive at 12:30am.

The wife texts me on the road saying she has no charger, I didn’t have one in the car and would need to pick one up from work and then drive it back. This would have taken a lot more time and I was up quite early for my job. She is always forgetting her charger and not charging up her phone even though I do politely remind her all the time AND I asked as we left the house if she had everything. I offered to bring one the next evening after work, she has her iPad and I have the landlady’s mobile number if I urgently need to get hold of her. So I thought to teach her a little lesson I wouldn’t bring her one until the next evening to reinforce the point that she needs to charge her phone. A massive argument ensued and she basically said she’d divorce me if I didn’t bring one tonight.

I’m just wondering AITA for not taking a charger?

The first day I ever met her, she spent over an hour telling me about every girl he’d ever dated, making sure to point out one of his exes was a lawyer (I’m a teacher). She is very possessive and controlling. 

Anyway, in late June, we were having a garage sale. My in-laws dropped off a bunch of stuff they didn’t want and told us we could keep the profit, which was nice. My MIL insisted on pricing all of her items, and was adamant that we did not take any less than she wanted. Odd, but whatever. 

One day before our sale, I was hanging out in my neighbor’s driveway; my husband was at the gym. I got a text from my husband saying that his parents would be by to “check on things;” his mom wanted to make sure everything looked the way it should. It is not usual that my in-laws just show up with little notice, and I wasn’t really doing anything, so this didn’t bother me. They did not give us an approximate arrival time, and my husband said he’d be home soon. 

Shortly thereafter, my in-laws arrive while I’m still at my neighbor’s. I live in a residential suburb and our houses are very close together and have short driveways; I waved at my father in law and he waved back. I intended to finish my conversation/activity with my neighbor and then would go back to my garage to speak to my in-laws. 

Less than 5 minutes after they arrived, they got in their car and left. I found out later that my MIL bitched to high heaven about how rude I was for not coming over to my garage immediately after their arrival. 

So, like I said, that was in June. Fast forward to this Christmas. We went to my MIL’s family home for the holiday (I really like her family). She barely spoke to me, which isn’t unusual for her (I never know if she’s going to try to be my best friend or if I’ll get the cold shoulder). At the end of the evening, she and my FIL were getting ready to leave. I hugged my FIL goodbye, but when I approached my MIL, she turned around and walked out the door. 

I told my husband I thought that was odd, and his response was, “I don’t know, maybe she’s still mad about the garage sale.”

It is not unusual for her to get really pissed and hold grudges over things I perceive as petty (she absolutely freaked out at me when I suggested we make a donation to the American Cancer Society in our wedding guests’ name instead of favors; she was very angry at me about that for a while). However, she was at my home and I didn’t greet her. 

So, let me have it. AITA?"

558,4orf18,"AITA For not wanting to work for my parents? A while back I left a job to focus more on school. Money ran out faster than I thought and my parents, who own a small business, offered me a job. I took it because it was flexible, I could work from my place and mostly because I needed money. We all agreed that it would only be temporary as they didn't want me becoming dependent on them. After a while, my mom would even get irritated with me because I still had not found a job. 

Recently I found a job so I put in my 2 weeks notice and left. However, they still come to me and ask me to do things for their company. It's easy stuff like entering data, but with my new job and summer school I've been super busy. So I don't really have the time or the desire even to work for them. But I still get emails from my parents asking me to do stuff for them. Whenever I say no, I get a guilt trip. I get told that it wont take that long and they would pay me for it too. They even tell me that I'm not helping out around the house all because I don't want to do more reports. But I just really don't have the time to and I really don't want to either. So, AITA?"
559,aggtxp,"AITA for not wanting to drive a friend home from college this semester? (TL;DR at end) For background, me and my friend had known each other since freshman year of high school. She is now one of the very very few people I still talk to from school.

Her and I both attend the same university now and we are about to start up our second semester. We both still live with our parents as we individually don't have the money to move out. Last semester I drove her home twice a week since we lived relatively close by and I knew she didn't have the best relationship with her parents. The first week it was ok since I was just excited to be doing something after a long summer of doing nothing but working.

It was during the first week that I learned that she still didn't have so much as a learners permit and she hasn't made any attempts at getting a job. Her parents are still paying for everything for her. As the weeks went by, all she ever did was complain about her parents being assholes, despite them still paying for everything for her. The drive from the university to where we live was over half an hour on a good day, an hour at the worst. She would talk the entire time and I could barely get a word in.

I considered telling her last semester that I didn't want to drive her, but she made me feel guilty about leaving her with her family. The one time I didn't drive her was because I had to take my sister to a doctors appointment and she got really pissed at me. She kept yelling into a group chat we are both in about how I couldn't make her get picked up by her parents and no one else wanted to take her home. She ended up staying at the school until midnight then called her grandmother to pick her up. After finals, I didn't even get a thank you for driving her home all of those times.

Now that we are going to be starting next semester, she keeps making offhanded comments about how she wants me to drive her home every day and I just ignore them. I really don't want to deal with all of that again. She still refuses to get a job and has barely recieved her learners permit, but she wouldn't shut up about how her parents bought her a new car. She won't be able to drive alone though until the middle of summer, so she still is going to be relying on her family to drive her.

I've only talked to two friends about the situation, one agreed with me, the other said I was being a major dick by not offering to drive her this semester. What should I do? Should I just tell her straight out that I'm not going to drive her or should I still drive her?

TL;DR: I am sick of hearing my friend do nothing but complain about her family on 40 minute drives and don't want to go through it for another semester."
560,cjq9om,"AITA For going solo on a group project? You know the drill. Throwaway account in case friends find me. 

I'm currently in my last year of highschool and it's basically everyone stressing because of things like final projects, picking a college ect.
 
Anyways 

Health teacher assigns a 20 page 2 person project (yay. A critical part of my grade) and assigns me me with S. S was that one kid who refused to participate in class or do homework. I wasnt thrilled and told the teacher in private that I did not want to work with her. Teacher says to at least try bc of 'you'll be a good influence'. 

We had only 1 week 
Right away I try make friends w/ S. I then told her that we should start working on the project tomorrow, but today we should plan things out. 
We agreed to go 50/50 on the essay. 

No go. 
Everytime I tried to ask S on her progress of the project she either texted ""sorry not feeling good, ttyl"" or ""We still have time, chill"". The real problem started when she stopped answering and ignored me until late Friday night. Through text she said she was sorry, she was at the hospital, ect. I felt bad and texted that we continue  next day (Saturday).

Saturday morning I went scrolling through Insta and I see S had been partying from the time she was ignoring me and was obviously never in the hospital. She was literally at a party when she texted me her whole 'apology'. I went solo. Emailed my teacher about the situation with screenshots. She emailed back that she understood and would email S to notify her. 

Monday comes and we have to start presenting projects. S comes late to class and tells me that she got sick at the hospital and couldn't start the work (she didn't even start ffs). Teacher calls my name to present and she gets up too. Teacher gives her a odd look and the rest follows :

T: Why are you getting up? 
S: (confused) We're project buddies
T:no, (My name) did the project on her own. You didn't help her. 
S: But I emailed you that I wouldn't be able to work on it because I was in the hospital! I texted (My name)  to make sure she knew! 
T: You lied, (My Name) sent me the screenshots and I emailed you that you would be doing the project alone. Did you read the email I sent? 
S: (face falls) :no... (Gets angry)  You're a fucking bitch (My name)! 

She leaves and I awkwardly presented my project. My friends are saying that I was kinda cold for cutting her out the project and should've at least gave her a heads up (The teacher did give her one though). One friend thinks that I was a bitch and should've just done the rest of the work if I was really THAT worried for my grade. I think it's fair what I did but maybe I was like too stiff? Reddit AITA?"
561,dja80y,"AITA for breaking up a relationship between our son and a girl, who both have disabilities? I honestly feel like the biggest asshole on Earth.

I have a 16 year old son with severe physical disabilities. He uses a motorized wheelchair and requires help to get in and out of it.

My husband and I are in a friends group of families with similarly disabled children.

My son recently announced that he is dating a 17 year old girl from the group. My only problem is that this girl has severe mental and physical disabilities. She has the mental capacity of a young child, is mostly nonverbal and has tics that will cause her to hit other people in the vicinity.

My son has zero mental disabilities. I was very uncomfortable with this relationship because of the huge difference in mental capabilities. My husband felt the same but not as strongly. 

However, literally everyone in the group has been thrilled about this ""romance"". Especially the girl's parents. They are talking about the two getting married for heaven's sake.

I thought that I'd just wait it out and have our son realize on his own that he cannot have a meaningful relationship with this girl.

But it's been 5 months and it's only getting worse.

I ended up putting my foot down and informed both my son and the girls parents that this relationship was completely inappropriate. Especially since my son has now started being hit by the girl during her tics and he is physically unable to defend himself. My husband supported me in this.

We have become enemy number one ever since. The parents have attacked us through texts and have turned everyone in the friends group against us.

But the thing that has hurt us most is our son's reaction. He has accused us of ruining his one shot at love. 

We've been to family therapy but my son has decided to ignore us completely not give us the silent treatment. My husband and I have decided not to cave.

Are we the assholes?"
562,bow38y,"AITA for leaving my GF alone to go on a family vacation? Me (24M) and my gf (21F) have been dating for just over 3 years. I love her through the ups and downs of our relationship. We both originated from the same country, she’s currently away from home and overseas for her studies,  (living in the same city as me) her family members are back home and my family is here. She usually goes home for summer for a 2-3 months and comes back when school starts. 

2 years ago, I went on a family trip on a cruise for 2 weeks. She was very upset when I went on the trip because that summer she was only staying because I was having my graduation ceremony and she was living in a poor living condition at the time. She had threatened to break up with me on the trip/before the trip because she can’t stand me being away. I basically broke my phone bill and paid over 500$ just to speak with her from time to time. She even blocked me on all social media just so I wouldn’t hear anything or seen anything from her. Eventually, we made it through, but it was a hell of a ride.

This year, same situation occurred, I am going away on a family vacation for 10 days. (However this time I will have more access to internet since I purchases a package as I knew I had to accommodate her somehow) This year she is not staying because of my graduation, but because she wanted to stay for few of her friend’s graduation and have taken an academic course here. I have previously notified her and we somewhat ‘agreed’ that I am going on the trip and I suggested she could go back earlier before my trip taken place this summer but she remained very upset. I have offered to pay for the trip if she wants to come along but since she had to take an academic course and it was our ‘family’ vacation, she declined. When she was booking her trip back home for the summer after I have booked my vacation, she still picked to go home days AFTER my vacation was taken place because of the course she is attending and friend’s graduation. 

Now, a day before the trip, she is mad at me again because I didn’t ‘learn my lesson’ over last time. We are currently sitting in the same room, but she refuses to communicate with me as ‘its useless since I’m leaving anyway’.  I have even taken the day off tomorrow just to spend a little more time with her. AITA for leaving her this time around?

For the record, I am extremely tolerant of her. I would say I love this girl very much but sometimes her emotion issues would just be very hard to deal with, but I take it and tank it through. I would say I do my boyfriend responsibility well. I understand her family is back home so I spend a good amount of time with her regularly. But when things like this comes up, she just go insane and storms over everything as ‘I am all she has here’. She is fine with her friends so I don’t think there is some sort of emotional depression issue)"
563,cwvzoh,"AITA for being angry at family because my mother screwed me over? Ok. Had a car accident got a settlement. I lived with my mother and split bills etc. Thought was to free up my mother financially and buy house so my SO and I would become first time  property owners. 

Had a huge family discussion with Mom's brother and wife, mom, my SO and I. We propose the following; I pay off all of mom's debts 13K worth of leins, collections etc. She repays me back in $250 twice a month til 13k is paid off. That $$ would go into.account to pay for remodeling/upgrading of house. Then by end of year we pay off remaining mortgage 61K and mom sell house to us for $1. Then Mom can stay, move, or whatever her heart desires.

All family likes plan and mom says yes. I then make the 13k in debt payments and Mom is free from debt. She borrowed $$ to go on Vaca as I house sit animals. I drop 1k for a dumpster rental and start getting rid of junk in preparation for remodeling.

Mom comes back and decided that the plan won't work and doesn't start paying me back AND decided not to sell us the house.

She finally starts repayments and finally outrights says she didn't agree to anything, we pushed her, and we are the assholes.

1 year later and family and myself don't speak anymore. I'm the asshole according to EVERYONE for demanding communcation from Mom, being ""mean"" and posting the truth on Facebook.

TRDL tried to help Mom while helping self, mom changed mind & I'm the asshole because in mad about it"
564,cgkj4n,"AITA for completely ignoring a guy who tried to speak to me, twice? I'm (20F) house sitting for a friend, and her apartment is in a rather shady part of town. But she's a good friend, I'm getting paid, and there's no one else who could do this for her so of course I accepted.

As I was walking back to the apartment with a load of groceries, there was a group of men standing around at the base of the stairs, talking. When they saw the grocery bags one of them started yelling after me asking if I had pizza rolls. I ignored him and tried to calmly but quickly scurry up the stairs as he repeated the question.

But I had to take another trip to my car to get the rest of the groceries. There was no way to go around or avoid those guys, but I didn't want to leave the stuff in my car because it is hot as hell and they would melt within ten minutes. So, head down, I hurried there and back. I managed to scoot around the corner without being seen on the way down, but coming back he shouted some more things after me that I couldn't really understand. I heard him ask ""are you her sister?"" And I assume he was referring to my friend, but I don't know how he would know what apartment I'm in (the door is around the corner from the top of the stairs) or if I know her. When I continued ignoring him he clicked his teeth and griped, ""man, she ain't like that."" Again I guess referring to my friend? Maybe she speaks to him occasionally?

It's a small thing but it really scared me, so badly that I was shaking. The door is locked but I can still hear them down there, talking and laughing.

But the more I think about it the more I wonder if I was being a dick. He might've just been trying to be friendly and I cold shouldered him. It's not like he was catcalling me. I've been assaulted before so I'm sure that's where some of the fear came from, but that's not really an excuse to be an asshole. Thoughts? I will accept my judgement."
565,bym089,"AITA for telling my grandmother to go back home? Ok, so my grandmother moved away from my family when I was pretty young, and we see her maybe once a year for about a week. But every time she comes up lately we start to have problems, and she gets my whole family fighting.
So this time she came up for my graduation, and it was her last day here. So she had to make a move. My younger brother was in a bad mood about having to eat something, and was telling everyone to shut up and being rude to my parents, until my father grabbed him and told him to go upstairs. 

Of course my grandmother hops up and confronts my dad. Granted, she is around 5 ft tall, and my dad is around 5'10''. She calls my father an abuser, makes up a bunch of stuff about him being verbally abusive, etc... Threatens to call child protection services. Remember, this is my graduation day. Eventually I go to my room, extremely upset by her actions. I hear her in the kitchen accusing my dad of more stuff, calling him a cheater because he went on a trip without my mom. No proof what so ever. 

It seemed evident to me that she was preparing this. It was instantaneously, and she brought a lot of stuff completely unrelated to the original ""problem."" She actually told my mom to divorce my dad. Of course my dad and my grandmother never got along, so whatever. But she made the claim that we were all afraid of my dad, and that's why we wouldn't stand up to him. It was bullshit. She pretends to know how we're treated all the time, and that she knows everything about our lives, but she lives ~2000 miles away. 

So I finally got up, and told her that she was full of shit. I told her she doesn't know Jack shit about what's going on here. That she moved away, and was thus not a part of my life, and no matter what my father was or did, at least he was always there. More than I can say for her. In the end she had my great grandma, her mom, join in, and when she disagreed with my grandmother, said ""fuck you"" to her. I told her promptly to fuck back off to her home, and to stop tearing apart mine. 

She went on this speel about how we always disrespect her, so I pointed out how she just told her own mom to fuck off. After that I told her I didn't care if I never saw her again, and left. AITA?"
566,cuje5c,"AITA for reporting two “bros” from another department to HR for their locker room talk in an elevator? Our firm occupies multiple floors in a high rise building, and I use the elevator multiple times a day because my department spans several floors. There are these two “bros” in another department I’ve run into many times. Usually the interaction is limited to a nod. They’re kind of a hybrid New England “Chad” meets Jersey “Bro” with a dash of homophobia. They’re the type who are probably book smart at SOME subjects but really got through life because of their parents. They’re so unaware of their surroundings that one time I was in the elevator with them, they were behind me, and one of them pointed out my pants to the other guy to make fun of the patterns, but I was able to see their reflections on the elevator’s metallic doors. 

So yesterday I had the misfortune of sharing the elevator with these two again. Except this time, they were talking about their weekend plans and how one was planning to impress a “chick” because she seemed like the she could “bang like a Bangkok stripper”. I assume she’s asian because they started doing the Full Metal Jacket sucky sucky five dollah and me love you long time schtick. I turned around and told them to keep inappropriate conversations out of the work place. And they just ignored me. 

Anyway, they might have thought because I’m male it was ok to talk like that at the workplace. I reported them to HR today. I’m thinking about shooting their boss an email as well to let him know I’ve reported the two bros, what my concerns are, and that they may need disciplinary action and sexual harassment training. 

My co-worker thought it may be a little drastic because that’s how those two are. But I disagreed. 

TL:DR: Two guys were having locker room talk in an elevator and I reported them to HR, and maybe their boss.

Edit 1: Thanks for the constructive feedback. I’m definitely not informing their boss. HR notified me that they will follow up with me and advised me to keep this confidential.

Edit 2: Some have asked/suggested I’m a woman or a heterosexual man. I’m an out and proud gay asian man. Lets put the silly speculations to rest.

Edit 3: Some here have very strong opinions. Please refrain from sending me any more private messages with tired homophobic insults like “f*ggot”. Lets keep this cordial. Thanks."
567,d700x0,"AITA for bleeding into an ruining a gigantic vat of chilli? I tend to get nosebleeds for a couple of months every year. I think it's due to the increasing dryness as the seasons change. I had a really bad one that kept recurring a few weeks ago, but it had since stopped and I hadn't started bleeding again in over a week.

My work hosted a potluck on Sunday, and one of my coworkers brought a GIGANTIC vat of chilli. She was heating it up and asked me to stir it occasionally while she went to tend to some other food item.

Of course, the worst timing in the world happened and my nose started bleeding profusely. I didnt notice for about 20 seconds until my coworker rushed over and grabbed my arm, practically flinging me away from the chilli. She then ran off crying hysterically. I had been accidentally dripping nose blood into her gigantic pot of food.

Naturally, the whole thing had to be thrown away. I felt terrible about it and apologized repeatedly, even offering to pay my coworker for the cost of the chilli and her time making it. She refused, and eventually calmed down but remained extremely cold to me for the rest of the event. 

This week at work has been horrible. She won't speak to me, and I've been getting mean looks from other coworkers. One coworker is quite good natured and has taken the whole thing in stride, he even bought me a giant pack of tissue boxes as a joke and to try to defuse the whole thing. But my coworker and the others she socializes with are not budging. They essentially hate me for this.

I ended up buying a $150 Visa giftcard for my coworker who made the chilli to apologize and take care of the cost of the wasted food, but she still wont speak to me. Some other coworkers have even audibly called me an asshole in the break room, not speaking *to* me but either about me to others or *at* me as they leave the room when we're alone.

I suppose I maybe should have been more cautious and not stirred the chilli, but I thought the nosebleed had completely subsided at that point and she asked me to stir the chilli. I had no way of knowing it would happen.

AITA? Could I have handled the situation any better, either before or after the bleeding occurred?"
568,aa5sde,"WIBTA If I told people to stop trying to preach to me to be a Christian again? So I’m going to try and keep this short, TLDR at bottom, but I’m an LGBT person and Wiccan. I left the Christian faith after being kicked out of a church (and eventually getting my family kicked out) for being transgender. I am not open about this detail in my public life, but I am open that I do have a boyfriend, but my next most private thing is my religious belief.

Recently at my convenience store work in a conservative Christian part of town, I’ve had a lot of people come up to me and try to ask me if I’ve heard the word of God. I tell them yes in some cases, but I left it for a personal reason, and then I get barraged with “Once you’re saved, you are always saved!” until I mention to them in the Bible that it actually says the one Unforgiveable sin is denying the Christian god and Jesus, and suddenly they tell me their life story and how much God has done for them, derailing the topic.

There are some instances where I just have to say “yeah I’m a Christian” so I don’t get lectured at work, or wherever I go in town. It’s pretty frequent I get asked this as the hours I work coincide with the services of 3 churches within a half mile of where I work. I’ve finally been able to tell certain people that on the clock, I have no religious or political opinion, but now when I come to my work casually, or in the area, it’s a lot harder to escape the question with regulars from my work who know that I am not a Christian.

Would I be the asshole if I start telling people I’m not interested in their beliefs and told them kindly to mind their own business? I know a part of me is hugely afraid of rejection and what other people think of me, especially since I’ve already faced a mass community rejection once. I don’t want people in my life to know my business but I feel like an asshole for lying. I just wish I could have my belief without people trying to just change me. I don’t try to convert people and I love everyone for who they are and their walks, I just wish the same hand would be given to me.

TLDR; I want people to stop trying to convert me to being a Christian after I faced mass rejection, but I feel like I would be an asshole if I told them to stop and that I’m not interested in their religion.

569,e5x369,"AITA, Threw my brothers mattress onto the footpath. My 18yr old brother has been living with me for a few months and he's not pulling his weight or abiding by any rules Ive put in place. He hasn't paid rent, living with me cause he's broke but he has a job.  And he keeps leaving  a mess in the kitchen and his room.  I have puppy and my brother has left kfc bones in his room for the puppy to find and eat several times. He also leaves dirty plates in his room sometimes with food on them for days.  The leaving dishes and food in the room is my pet peeve and I've torn him to shreds about it multiple times but he doesn't listen. 

Today I  came home from work and couldn't find my headphones,  found them in his room and also found a plate on the floor with half of his dinner from the night before.  

So I put his mattress outside and texted him that he didn't live with me and took my dog for a walk.  

He's begged to me that he has nowhere else to go and he's cleaned up the house tonight and apologized. I'm not going to kick him out but I have no idea of how to get him too listen. I'm just over being treated like I don't have a say in my own house.

570,ct1tsh,"AITA for refusing to communicate with my biological father? So backstory of my life: I was raised to know my brothers dad as my dad but around the age of 10ish I started realizing that something wasn’t right with how his family treated me and him differently. Then around age 12 my mom sits me down and decides to tell me the truth and I’m like “I already guessed that” and she asks me if I want to open up a line of communication.

My first memory of him is just his voice through the phone when I turned 13. Then nothing up to the present (I’m 18). I mean I’m sure he’s sent me a few birthday or Christmas cards here and there. He even sent me $20 for graduation (lol as if $20 compensates for giving my depression a running start). Well actually he tried to reach out to me like 2 years ago but I never responded because I physically couldn’t even open his message. My entire mind and body would not allow me to open his message. So it’s been sitting unopened for two years. 

I’m my “real” dads last kid and he was two kids that are like a decade older then me so I guess I have some resentment towards him for the fact that he wasn’t there for me specifically. Him and my mom were never in a real relationship they just stayed together and you know this happen. 

My mom wants me to communicate with him because he’s a little older then she is and she thinks that if I don’t talk to him before he’s old and senile that I’ll regret it. She said that he’s expressed wanting to get to know me over the last few years but understands that I should be my decision. But I don’t want to. It’s not like he’s poor and couldn’t afford to come see me or reach out. From my point of view it looks like He just didn’t put in the effort. So AITA for refusing to even establish a bare minimum relationship with him? And for (kinda) ghosting him?"
571,eksd4l,"AITA for shutting down the electric to my moms house after finding out she had used my social security without my knowing? Unknowingly to me (M20) for the past two years my mom has been using my social security number to open an account with an electric company and since she opened it she hasn’t paid one bill, racking up over 5400 USD in debt under my name. 

I only found out about the bill after I went to check the mail christmas day and saw mail from the company to me. She had hidden it from me for over two years. 

I was furious and panicked because I’m supposed to be getting married, I’m in college, and already it felt as though my life was already hitting a block, and now I wasn’t even going to be able to put the power for my own house under my name and my credit would be down the drain if I didn’t do something about it. So I texted my mom asking about it, I tried to be respectful about it, but she threw a fit, yelled at me, and immediately tried to turn the tables on me. She had tried saying that I told her she could use my name, but even if I did, (which I know I didn’t because I would remember something like this) it’s the fact she didn’t pay a penny for two years, since she opened the account. She said things to me like I ruined Christmas, how terrible I am treating her, I don’t appreciate anything she does for me, and tried holding college over my head saying she isn’t going to help me do anything, or pay anything for my college if I try to do anything about the electric. Some of the things were so bad that my fiancé said I should delete the messages so I don’t have to look at them whenever I get on my phone.

After much thought and consideration, I decided to shut the power off, I gave my mom some time to figure something else out for the power to the house and I’m not sure if she thinks I’m serious or not but I intend on closing the account. She now has basically disowned me, and after talking to my little brother, (He’s 18), I heard how she tried turning my siblings against me, telling them how terrible I am and twisting the situation in favor of her. 

My friends think I should sue her, but as my mother I don’t think I could bring myself to do it,  I told her I’ll take the debt on but I’m not letting the account stay open.



Edit: Hey all, thanks for the Santa’s last ride. I noticed a lot of comments on this, I want to get to them all and try to read them all. As of now there’s a few questions about why it wasn’t shut off earlier and accrued so much debt,  to be honest, I’m not sure, I called the company and they transferred me to a few different departments such as payments, billing, account services, etc. but most of the workers there said they aren’t sure either and they’re going to look into it and let me know what comes up. As things progress I’ll update this in the future and if anyone is curious as to what happens you can check back. Thank you all for any advice and support given and I’m taking it all into consideration. I can’t let this just slide, the consequences would be too dire."
572,d0c3vc,"AITA for not wanting to do free editing work for family? Just happened, am still irritated, but is a developing situation.

I (22F) am known as the ""English person"" in my immediate family, meaning that if you have a question about writing/grammar/etc. I'm usually the person to ask. Most of my family is more STEM-oriented and English isn't something that comes super naturally to them (we're all native speakers, writing well just isn't a strong suit). Usually I get asked simple one-off stuff like ""does this sentence sound right"" and everything's fine. I currently work part-time as a proofreader and have previously worked as an English tutor.

My mom just asked me if I would 

To be fair, I don't particularly like this cousin nor her parents, which also affects why I'm less interested in doing it for free. That being said, when I've edited ""unpaid"" in the past, it's usually been for good friends who'll generally ""pay it back"" some other way.  I also don't think my mom understands how long these things can take - she said to ""let her know when I had a free half hour,"" but I've spent HOURS doing this for other people, as personal essays require a lot more back and forth to refine, not just a brief look over. I did actually charge one friend for essay editing after it took me days of back and forth with him, and he did agree to pay.

AITA? I don't think I should have to work for free, especially given that editing/proofreading is my actual job, but I know my cousin's parents would never pay me, and my mom keeps very long grudges when she thinks she's been slighted. I also have other relatives who work in high school education who would probably be more qualified to look at it anyway. I also live with my parents, so... there's that, if that's a mitigating factor. Part of me feels like I'm just going to get gradually nagged as it gets closer to college app deadlines, so even if I'm NTA, I'll need to give in just so I don't go insane."
573,cjehty,"AITA for quitting my (M26) job? Hi, I am trying to understand if i am doing the right thing and not overreacting? I also apologise for the length, I'm trying to add in as much details possible to give an accurate representation of the situation

Last year I was working in retail and ended up getting paid off, I spoke to my Dad who owns a small local business about how i was feeling etc and at the end of the conversation i found out my dad was hiring and i needed work so obviously i went to work for my Dad, (My parents are separated, dad remarried and had kids etc)

Now everyone on my Mums side of the family told me before going into it what to expect from my Dad, but as I've had a quite distant relationship I didnt really have a full on opinion with him and I thought they were just talking shit to belittle him, I decided to take it and try it out and see if i could have an adult relationship with him

Anyway, after working at the business for a couple weeks I started to pick up that he really has no idea how to communicate with employees, nothing that we would say would ever be the right thing unless the same words came out of his mouth, as an example, the water boiler broke for making drinks, I told him that it was broke only to be told no its working fine before i even get to finish my sentence, i pointed out the faults and am told thats just how it works.. fast forward 3 days and the machine is completely fucked and no sign of it being fixed in a couple days - somehow my fault - thing like this would occur sometimes multiple times a week

If me or any other employee made any form of mistake you were spoke to and talked down to as if spilling a drop of water equated to the same crime as killing a puppy, I would also have other staff members complain to me about how shit the working conditions were and when i would bring them forward i would get shut down immediately

We worked 6 days a week every week and still not achieving 40 hours, the job itself is incredibly fast paced and stressful and every shift we could probably have done with an extra 2-3 more staff to cover everything effectively

And the final straw for me was when a shitty review came in about a kitchen staff member and her actions, but the blame was shifted to us in the front of house and when I tried to explain the situation and what caused it I was then told by my father than I am not good enough and that if it was other colleagues in instead of me this wouldn't have happened.

At that point I told my Dad that he was being completely unrealistic in terms of what he expects and that we are all humans and that mistakes happen, took off my work clothes and went home (i dont live with my dad)

This happened 2 weeks ago to date and I've made no attempt to contact my dad and same with him me, I'ts been completely silent since I walked out.

So, AITA here or is me walking out of this justified?

TL;DR Started working for dad, dad treats employees and myself like shit, doesn't listen to feedback etc, belittles employees, I quit and no contact has been attempted"
574,cc4pjl,"AITA For Not Accepting Gifts? My father and I have had a severely strained relationship which I don't wish to improve: I got the brunt of his abuse when he was abusing drugs, and I know he still smokes weed. One of the biggest things he did was ""apologized"" to ""me"" (both in quotes because he actually said it to my mother but not once uttered the words to me).

As a way to make amends with me roughly a year after his outburst, he decided to invite me to a concert to see his favorite band for my birthday. I repeatedly said I wasn't interested and he still got me a ticket. He also bought me several copies of their CD's (the band is Blackmore's Night). Honestly, my cousin made me burned copies of most of their CD's that I prefer to listen to. He bought me one of the seasons of Rick and Morty (Season 1, I think).

A few months ago, my mother mentioned me having a second guitar which was unusual, as I bought myself one and I haven't really played it. He left two guitars here for my sister to take to her apartment when he went down south for the winter.

Today, I was going to my sister's apartment for a cookout with him and my mother. As I was getting into his car (I don't drive), he tried handing me a tag and told me it was for my guitar. I told him I only had the one I bought. He said no, I had an acoustic. I kept repeating that I only had the one, and he said ""God, I don't know what I said to you, but I'm sorry,"" snottily, like it was my fault he didn't tell me he bought me a guitar.

Every single time he decides he wants to make our relationship better he buys me something, but won't listen to something that I'd actually use (I've told him that I'd love a case and stand for my guitar, if he got it I'd pay him back). Instead, he gets me something he wants me to have.

Here's where my dilemma is: I don't want a relationship with him as he can be quite horrible (I wrote a book, had an agent interested in it-they ultimately passed but gave me some helpful advice as it doesn't fit into what they usually sell, and when I decided to be the bigger person and reach out, he spent about a minute telling me that he couldn't bring himself to read what I'd given him-which he asked for-in case it sucked before spending the rest of the time telling me how I ought to call him once a week). But every time he buys me a gift, I'm treated like an asshole because I don't want it, it's nothing I can use and don't have space for.

I even told him tonight I don't have space for it, (after the several times he's asked me if I wanted anything from his former apartment as he's decided to move into a camper over the summer and live down south over the winter), he made me feel like shit for not wanting it.

So Reddit, am I the asshole for not accepting gifts I don't want in the first place? WIBTA if I told him to stop giving me gifts, or if he had to give me stuff, ask me first if I want/need it; if he doesn't I'll sell it if he won't take it back?"
575,ctwk69,"AITA for telling my wife and in-laws to fuck off after they told me to stop cuddling my daughter? I have 3 kids, 15F, 12F and 7M. My oldest has always been a cuddler, and that suits me fine because I am too. Recently my in laws were over, and we were all watching a movie together. It was a kids movie, and so my 15yo was bored out of her mind and tired, so she started to snuggle up to me and go to sleep.

After the movie was over, we sent all the kids to bed/their rooms and got chatting for a bit longer. There was a fair bit of wine involved (I was sober though), and eventually after a short silence my FIL let it drop that he thought it was inappropriate I still cuddled with my 15yo. I don't really know why he brought it up suddenly, but I was prepared to laugh it off and just assumed it was the alcohol. To my surprise, my wife and MIL both agreed with him.

I have a lot of respect for my in-laws, I get along with them great and I consider them closer than my own parents. Obviously I'm quite fond of my wife as well, but I outright told them to ""fuck off and go fuck themselves"" and then left them and went to bed. I've never spoken to any of them like that before, but it felt like the right thing to say in the moment. They all want me to apologize for being so rude to them. AITA?

Edit due to info request: We were not spooning, she was sitting next to me laying on my chest.

Edit of my own free will: Idk if it's important info, but I didn't yell.

Edit: I think I've read most everything now, thanks for all the messages of support and hate, I liked them all. Some people asked me to make an update post, I don't think I will, sorry. I've been speaking to them over the past few days and I know why they said what they said (although it's not relevant to me telling them to fuck off), but it's pretty personal and I don't feel like sharing. I wont be apologizing to any of them, especially now that I know their reasoning. I love my wife, but it hurts that she doesn't trust me."
576,dnciab,"WIBTA if I told my cousin what my sister said about her? Two things to note at the top of this post: this is an alt account, because I'm fairly sure my sister monitors my main lol. Also, I know my sister is an asshole in general and that's not what I'm asking for here. I wanna know if it'd be a shitty move for me to grass on her. 

So, as I said just there, my sister is not a very nice person. She's very entitled and spoiled, and is honestly just kind of a fucking bully. She was known for it at school and it definitely hasn't stopped in her adult life. She's also getting married soon, oh joy. 

We were both at mum's house the other day and she was talking about her plans for her bridal party. She said she's having six bridesmaids: our little half sister on dad's side, four of her close friends and our cousin. I was pretty shocked that she wanted the cousin to be a part of the bridal party. She's a really awesome person and everything, but I didn't think she and my sister were close. In fact, I didn't think she and my sister had even spoken for at least a year or two. Turns out I was right. Seeing mum and I were confused, sister laughed a bit and said ""imagine how pretty we'll look in pictures with her!"" 

Cousin has a lot of scarring down one side of her face from an accident when she was a kid. She used to be incredibly self conscious about it as it is rather obvious but she's more comfortable with herself these days. However I know her appearance is still a pretty sore spot for her. Case in point, some rude arse man in a pub made a comment to her about it a few months ago and she got really upset and went into a depression for a couple of weeks. 

I don't want to upset her or make her feel shitty, but I'm also totally disgusted (though not surprised) by my sister and hate the idea of my cousin being in the bridal party while the rest of them are all laughing about her behind her back. However, I'm scared that if I tell her she'll have the same reaction that she had to the knobhead in the pub. Plus she'd inevitably tell my aunt what my sister said, and it would definitely cause family drama. Would it be a dick move for me to tell her? Or is it the right thing to do?"

Long story short, we have two new event coordinators at my job that replaced the one girl who had been here for just over five years.

These two new girls have now planned two events for us that I personally think have been really fun, but I know it's a lot different than the type of things the old event coordinator used to do, and I've noticed my team (my boss and two coworkers) kind of making fun of them and being rude about it behind their backs with other employees outside our team. It really bothers me because I know they're new, with big shoes to fill, and they have a sharp learning curve ahead of them. I probably empathize with them because I'm also still pretty new (I've been here six months - the rest of my team has been here at least a year and a half). I want to tell my team to stop being so mean and go easy on them while they learn how things work at this company and in our industry, but I don't know if it's the right move/if I would be an asshole.

578,chotlt,"WIBTA If I told my friends girlfriend he was cheating on her? So I met this girl on Tinder and invited her to a little get together on July 4th with my friends and me. During this party, my other friend and the Tinder girl were really hitting it off. I would've been alright with it if it wasn't for the fact that this man already has an awesome girlfriend who is also one of my best friends. I let it slide for the night as they weren't doing anything risque but the next day I called him out on it and told him to back off because he already has a girlfriend and I want a chance with this chick. He agreed and backed off but not before calling me a pussy and telling me that I should've manned up and just made a move that night.

So after that, I hung out with her over the course of 2 weeks and got to know her really well. We started hitting it off and soon enough I found myself kind of dating her with her reciprocating. The moment I thought I was in the clear I invited everyone back to a small get together. Immediately she started hitting off with my friend again and I even dragged him to the back to tell him to back off and that I almost have something here. He agreed but showed no signs of backing off. In fact, he even asked me if I could back off so he could have her. I started freaking out and ended up saying some pretty bad stuff that freaked everyone else out including the girl who left because of it. I immediately realized how embarrassing that was and apologized to everyone the next day.

At this point, I don't expect the girl to feel anything for me so I started to treat her as a friend. One day, she sends a picture of my friend, one that I've never seen before and I immediately knew something was up. So I set up another meetup and during it, I drag him to one of the backrooms and asked him to tell me everything he was hiding. He admits to me that he had sex with the girl the night I was horribly freaking out and that I should get over it because it's just one Tinder girl. I am fucking furious at this point because a guy that I assumed to be one of my best friends broke my trust. He doesn't seem to understand that and continues to just focus on how it was just one random ass girl. 

The next day he comes to my house and still asks me why the hell I'm so upset and that it's still just one girl and that I should fuck her and get over it. At this point, I am angry at my so-called best friend for not realizing what he did wrong and own up to it. At this point, I just want to teach this fucker a damn lesson. 

Would I be the asshole if I told his girlfriend that he cheated on her? Would it even be my place to do so? If I do this I know for a fact that it is only to get back at him and not genuinely for his girlfriend. If I do this then I would most likely also lose the majority of my life long friends. Right now I am fucking pissed off and I completely admit that the one thing that I want the most right now is to see him suffer the way I am right now."

My BIL has been estranged from the entire family for half a decade. Now he’s homeless, with two kinds of cancer, and a raging opiate addiction. 

Unbeknownst to me, my husband gave him our address and told him he’s welcome to stay with us. I’m furious.

581,c76rq2,"AITA for calling the police on my neighbour? Bit of backstory, I've lived in my current flat for the past 8 months or so. During that time, my upstairs neighbour (we'll call her Amy) has had regular (if infrequent) meltdowns. I would guess about once a month.

These meltdowns can involve anything from crying to wailing to full on screaming. Usually it's just her crying to herself and whining to herself about something and is loud enough that it sounds as though its coming from the next room, but a couple of times she's had such bad meltdowns that it sounds as though something is really wrong.

The first time this happened, I ran upstairs and knocked on the door to ask what the hell was happening, to which her mother answered the door saying she was ""Just a little distressed"". I thought fine, as long as she's not dying or whatever.

So this happened about 4 or 5 more times over the course of the last 6 months. The (second) to last time, I had enough. I heard screaming, loud banging noises, enough to think she was getting beaten up. I called the police and they knocked on her door maybe 5 minutes later. I overheard in the hall, after calling one of her relatives, that she had mental issues and refused to see a doctor/get help.

Fast forward to earlier today. She was crying/wailing again and since I hadn't had an 

I'll be completely honest here, I partly wanted to call the police just to get it into her head that freaking her neighbours out with her meltdowns isn't really cool for harmonious living. It was jointly a noise complaint as much as being concerned.

Queue the police chatting with her at our shared doorstep. She came up and knocked on my door 5 mins later. She was visibly annoyed that I called the police twice now for what she said was ""just a few tears"" and that calling the police was just making her more stressed. I explained that I have no idea what's happening up there, and for all I know she *was* getting beaten up. I also explained that I've had to call police before for a similar incident at my old place and to be honest even she didn't cry as much as her. I apologised and closed the door on her.

She knocked again and just wanted to re-assure me that she wasn't having a go she was just saying it wasn't helping. I said fine I won't call again unless I hear something clearly wrong and apologised again.

582,dp35d8,"AITA for Trying to explain alimony to a classmate? History class in college. Pre-reconstruction
We are learning about Women's Rights and the Seneca Falls Convention of 1848. The class is split up into groups and are told to come up with 3 resolutions that we want to be voted on. (Trying to recreate what happened at the convention)
The homework stated to brainstorm some. When we separated into groups, we talk main points that wanted resolved. One guy (we'll call him Bob) kinda takes the lead and is kinda throwing alot of information out there and not writing things down. None of them were specific. During a pause, I tell them a resolution I wrote, one with details... I then apologize for having come up with a finished one already because I worked on it last night. (I'm one of those people who apologize a lot)
Bob then says ""it's alright"" and then kinda continues talking as if I never really spoke...

Teacher comes over and hears our ideas and I share them because I wrote them down-- he asks us to be more specific.
The group talks again and I interject with women needing to have the right to divorce and be granted alimony. Bob shoots it down and says ""no we should say that they need to get compensated in a divorce"" 
I reply that's alimony 
He ignores this and continues explaining his idea.
I then repeat that the very concept he is explaining is the definition of alimony. 

He then says ""jeez no need to get frisky"" and all conversations end.
It got a little heated and even the teacher calls out if everything is alright. 
Bob says ""Yeah, we're good""

When it's our turn to present in the class, I stay quiet because Bob took the lead and has before win the past in other groups. Bob finally speaks up and is starting to explain one resolution but is having trouble with remembering the word ""contractional rights.""
I whisper the exact wording he used in our discussion before to him. 
I think he doesn't hear me so I whisper it again. He's still having trouble explaining his thought process and the girl next to me is whispering ""contractional rights"" as well to jog his memory. He then says out loud (projecting to the class) ""I got it! I'm just trying together my thoughts. Jeezus""
And then proceeds to explain the resolution without using his original explanation in the group setting with the term ""contractional rights"" as if avoiding the same wording would show that he doesn't acknowledge us. 

I know I'm probably over thinking this but, idk. 
I didn't mean to push and make him feel attacked but I didn't like the fact he thought leading the conversation means dismissing other ideas... Especially if it's the same idea. Plus, I sometimes have trouble finding the words to my sentences when speaking out in front of people and appreciate it when others try to help me. I guess it wasn't a reciprocated sentiment.

I was in the car with my mom, and we were driving home. I was talking to her about how the classes went, and she was talking about work. We then got on the topic on bills, which I help her submit payments through her bank for, and how I never paid a specific bill. Obviously, the bill was late, and she was charged a late fee. At that point, I felt really bad because it was my fault that this was happening, but then she starts saying how her bills are more important than my computer, which she says all the time, and I understand what the point she was trying to get through was.

However, I got frustrated with how she was constantly reminding me that it's my fault that she was charged, and I raised my voice at her. I told her that if she didn't trust me with her bills, she can either have my brother do them, or I could show her how to submit the payments. Then, she said ""You know what? I don't deserve to get yelled at like this. Watch what'll happen when I don't call you to wake you up for school. Maybe you'll stay in the 9th grade for the rest of your life.""

She has had a lot of support with her mental health from medical professionals, friends, family, people she works with, basically everyone she meets bends over backwards to keep her happy as she’s seen as so fragile and unpredictable.  She prefers more of a ‘spiritual’ approach which evidently is not working and tbh some of the things she does to heal are in my opinion ridiculous and are just gimmicks aimed at people who are vulnerable and have money to waste so it’s difficult for me to have as much sympathy as I should when it seems like she’s not really trying.

Because she controls it, i can’t really look into my money or how much my salary was and it bothers me. 
I asked her about it, she said i need a new card because it expired and then i should be able to with the bank app.
I don’t know a lot about that stuff so i asked her if she could help me out with it, on which she replied that she’d help me out later because it’s not that important.

So i kinda forgot about it, and i don’t REALLY spend my money a lot so i’m pretty much saving almost everything i earn, and ask time to time how much i have.

But here’s the isssue, last wednesday i’ve asked her to look how much i had because i wanted to buy a new game and wanted to see if i had enough.
She hesitated heavily and didn’t want to show me and didn’t want to look into it, it weirded me out a little.

Which reminded me of something that happend a while ago; she was looking into my account, i was watching over her shoulder and i saw “-€20” .
I asked her about it and she kinda laughed it off and said she needed it to buy ‘groceries’.
And look, I don’t mind if she would take my money because she was short on it, and we obviously need to eat.
But whenever my dad needs it or borrows it, he ALWAYS mentions it, and eventually gives the money back one way or another.
And my mom doesn’t, and i don’t remember her going to the supermarket either to get stuff since my dad always does so.

I don’t really trust her, also because she orders a lot of sh*t online and buys a lot of things for herself randomly and whenever i want to buy something for myself it’s not possible and she gets angry at me for it.

I’ve been paying attention to red flags too, and there are a few;
for example her never really showing how much i have, that whenever i ask about it she gets really worked up and pissed and doesn’t want to show me or tell. That she can ALWAYS buy something for herself but when someone else even tries to order or buy something hell’s breaking loose because suddenly we are short at the end of the month.

I already asked my dad about it and he doesn’t know either, but also thinks after i explained it that my mom’s acting suspicious about it.
I don’t want to call her a thief or jump into conclusions but it really is weird! I should be able to look into it and manage my money! 

so WIBTA if i confront her about it and kinda already assume that she’s taking my money and spending it for herself without me knowing?"
589,dx2t5f,"AITA for telling my mother that she needs therapy, not a baby? My adoptive mother is 58 years old. My adoptive father is 60. I was always told as a kid that they were infertile due to my mother's endometriosis and that's why they didn't have babies. She'd had an early miscarriage once and was told that her issues were from that and another *controversial* procedure. She's always been sad over it and believed it was her fault. I don't believe anything like this, fertility is just a matter of biology, nothing more.

As it turns out, one of her doctors was that guy who was sterilising people. He cut out her tubes (sorry, I'm not very smart on this). She was weirdly thrilled to hear it, like someone finally said that it wasn't her fault she couldn't have kids. The hospital offered her some kind of discount, and for some reason she's gung ho about doing a round of IVF. Again, at almost 60 YEARS OLD.

She obviously has to use a donor egg, and she asked me (not what this is about). I said no, and they got a stranger. I told her in a conversation that maybe an infant at 60 isn't a good idea and maybe some therapy over her pain is what she actually needs. She got really mad at me for not ""supporting her dreams"" and hung up. I live with my fiance and am independent so there's no danger.

AITA for saying something? I understand getting carried away in dreams, but sometimes an objective opinion can be a good thing."
590,eaya5u,"AITA for getting my nails done? So I (18F) am an apprentice. I don’t earn much money, and save the most that I can. 
I’m also a “bigger girl” so for me I feel insecure in most clothes. However I love getting my nails done every so often. 

My mum (46f) doesn’t work as she is an alcoholic. Because of this she hardly spends money. Everything I buy she asks the price of and berates me for spending more than I can afford.

So I got my nails done, they were on offer for £20. When I got home she burst out at me for again spending too much, being irresponsible and not thinking maturely. 

FYI: I get £700 a month. £50 goes to her for board (however I spend my time at my bf house) another £100 on bills such as my phone and laptop £130 ish for myself and the rest in savings. 

Should I be saving more? And not getting luxuries until I am more stable (ie my own house and family) am I really a terrible person for getting my nails done despite what my mum told me to do!"
591,ds70fq,"AITA for telling my coworker ""I think it's best we stick to office talk"" and not explaining why? I (22f) work in an office. I'm also bisexual and I've been in a relationship with a woman for just over a year.

I have this coworker, ""Jan"". She seemed friendly enough at first, but the second we a conversation that went beyond ""how was your weekend"" I realised that she's very religious (Roman Catholic). I didn't think that automatically made her homophobic (I'm Jewish myself) but it did make me approach the situation with a bit more caution than I would have otherwise.

My girlfriend's name is Christina and if I'm ever unsure about someone being pro or anti gay I just call her Chris and avoid pronouns (she does the same and calls me Lee if in doubt), and I did this for a while with Jan, but I always worried she noticed something was weird, because I'd always be going to great lengths to say Chris instead of using she/her.

Then a little while ago this thing came on the radio about the gay marriage results in Ireland. She asked me what I thought and while I think it's amazing I was careful to keep my response neutral (I think I said it wasn't my business or something like that) Jan, however, was not a fan, and gave the classic spiel about ruining the sanctity of marriage.

The next day she starts up with small talk, asking about Chris. I say ""I think it's best we stick to office talk.""

She doesn't know what she did wrong. I have not told her about my sexuality or my girlfriend. Other coworkers have noticed that we've gone from talking a lot to bare minimum (""doing a coffee run, want anything?"" ""I've sent something to your printer by accident, can you pass it here?"" ""do you have the paper copy of \[client document\]?"") Jan has communicated to another coworker that she doesn't know what she did to upset me.

AITA for saying we should keep it to office talk and not telling her why?

&#x200B;

Edit: I appreciate the comments saying I can be the one to change her mind but that's not necessarily how it works. My parents were very religious and I couldn't get them to accept me, my few months of conversation with a coworker won't be enough to change her mind, either. And I'm not going to HR unless she finds out, but where we live I legally can't be fired for being bi. They could maybe get angry that I'm bi and fire me and say it's for something else, but I am good at what I do so that's unlikely."
592,edmkts,"AITA for trying to kick out my roomate? Me and my best friend (both 18f) moved into a apartment in August with 2 other random roomates who are 22f and 38f. We both moved  in thinking it was student housing and would only be around people our own age, but that’s on us for not doing our research. At first we all got along really well. 

Our 38 year old roomate has been a bit of a hot mess. She had been unemployed since we moved in (she quit 2 jobs on her first day and got fired from 1 in the first week) but has recently started a new job. Her mom has paid her rent the last few months. She has 2 kids that come and stay with us most weekends, and has somewhat shady guys spend a lot of nights. She does drugs and other shady things that kind of stress us out. She also is very messy. 

She is very manipulative. She asks all of us for money and favors. I have a hard time saying no especially when she guilts or lies to me to get me to do it. I’ve started saying no to giving her money, but i still drive her to work or pick her up often. She works 30 minutes away which costs me a lot of time and money (with gas and tolls it really adds up). And aside from everything i’ve done that didn’t ask for repayment for, she owes me 200$. Everyone thinks i’m crazy for giving her that much money, but a lot of it was stuff for her kids, 75 was for a textbook rental she left out in the rain. 

It’s gotten to be a lot do deal with mentally and financially. My best friend has been gone for most of the last month because she can’t deal with it. She recently confessed to me that her and my other roommate had been planning to try to kick her out but gave up because they didn’t think id go for it. So she decided that she was moving out. I don’t want my best friend to move out so I agreed to support them. 

We went to the office yesterday to tell them our issues and they told us the only issue that they could actually deal with was the cleanliness and if it continues that she could get transferred or evicted. He said the guest policy would be hard to enforce especially since it’d be hard telling someone there kids couldn’t be there (our issue is mostly with the guys she brings over). They sent a notice today. 

I know that my roomate is very toxic and causes a lot of problems, but I never would have gone to those extremes if it weren’t for wanting my friend to stay. The people I’ve talked to about it are supportive of my decision, but I still feel awful for stabbing her in the back."
593,dlfuvn,"AITA for telling my best friend to stop asking me if I like someone I was in class with my best friend and she kept asking me if I liked someone. Now, she kept asking me this since the school year started. And like every time, I told her "" No,I don't like anyone."" And EVERYTIME she said ""Are you sure?"" And if I kept saying no she'll just repeat the question. This happened when we were out, and on the phone calls and it's annoying.


We were in our break, since we're at school and she asked me if I liked someone. And I said ""No"" and then she said ""Look you can be honest with me and Jack (I highly dislike Jack,and she knows it. She told me herself that Jack talks to her about me and tell really bad stuff about me. That I'm ugly,fat etc and yet she keeps wanting to hang out with him. This actually reminds me of a situation with another girl that said that my best friend talks shit about me.And the girl said that I kept talking shit about my best friend too.Even though they were all lies, my best friend kept hanging around her too while I only have her since I don't know who to trust anymore)
Back to the subject, I told her,annoyed ""No,I don't like anyone so stop asking me because you are annoying me. If I ask you if you like someone, you tell me no and If I ask more you get annoyed so stop please"" and then she got mad at me and now ignores me completely and rolls her eyes when I ask her something


When we were in IT class I told her I'm sorry, since I felt bad. And then she told me ""You should be"" and rolled her eyes,ignoring me again.
That made me angry and I'm not sure what to do anymore. I lost all of my friends to be friends with this person and I don't know what to do. Am I the antagonist?


Tl;dr : I told my best friend to please stop asking me if i like someone because it was annoying but she got mad at me and I am starting to feel like an asshole."

I gladly let him go out as I am trying to cut back drinking and didn't want him to miss out. We usually spend every day together so it was nice for me to have alone time too.

But like one text or call would be nice. I've told him many times before that this makes me happy."
595,b40xeo,"AITA for being hurt that my boyfriend wouldn't dress down to a wedding with me? So I agreed to go to an out of town wedding with my boyfriend, and a few weeks in advance I asked what I should wear. I didn't own a suit, and wanted to know if slacks and a button down would be too casual. I had plenty of money to be able to afford a suit, and as an adult man it would be reasonable for me to have one anyway.  He told me that it would be totally fine, I didn't need a suit. 

Flash forward to the night before we leave for the wedding, we're packing and I notice he's packing a suit.  I said I thought we didn't need suits and he said I'd still be fine without one, but he was going to wear one.  This got me concerned that I'd be really underdressed.  I asked him if he could please not wear a suit, since I still didn't have one and had no way to get one in time.  I assumed this would be fine, since he told me it'd be okay not to wear one in the first place.  He probably just didn't realize that I'd feel a lot more comfortable: I knew that if we were dressed to the same level, I'd feel less out of place (you know, solidarity and all that). I didn't know anyone at the wedding and am just self conscious about being over/under dressed to things generally.  To my surprise, he outright refused.  He said HE'D feel underdressed and out of place at a wedding without a suit. We argued about it for awhile, and at the end of the day he still refused to dress down at all.

This hurt my feelings quite a bit because it felt like he was choosing appearances over my feelings.  Essentially he'd rather me feel underdressed than him, even when he told it'd be fine in the first place.  If he wouldn't feel comfortable without a suit, why would he tell me I'd be okay without one? I couldn't (and still don't) understand--if the roles were reversed, I'd dress down in a heartbeat.

I recognize that this is a small deal, it sounds silly even writing it, but to me that almost makes it worse--I was having a ton of anxiety about it, and it seems like such a small thing for him to just dress down to the level he told me was reasonable.  On the other hand, I wonder if I'm the asshole for being hurt and making such a big deal out of this, because it's his decision to wear what he wants to wear and I shouldn't be trying to control that even if it WOULD make me feel a lot more comfortable?  So what do you think, AITA?"
596,cmcoju,"WIBTA if I dropped out of a wedding party a month before the wedding? I am a bridesmaid for a wedding in Sept. the bride (k) is best friends with my best friend (m). K and I are not close and I was asked to be a bridesmaid after a different girl dropped out. K and M have asked me to help with some of the planning and asked that I plan a Bridesmaids get together. 

The bridal party is pretty large consisting of the bride's friends, family, and future family. I asked my partner (b) if we could use his families cottages (this was my first time there) to have a summer getaway at the lake. K was pretty rude and mean to me the whole time she was there to the point where others noticed. M brought it up to K, K got more upset and it was not the enjoyable weekend that we had hoped. 

K apologized for being rude but doesn't see that she was mean or that it got to the point where others could see. I felt her apology wasn't that genuine. The whole situation caused a lot of stress for M since she was caught in the middle. I think any future things that we do will result in the same behavior. WIBTA if I just dropped out?"
597,bpumhy,"AITA for not wanting to meet my boyfriends family? A week ago I noticed my boyfriend liking revealing photos of his ex gf on Instagram. I was upset and sent him a message explaining how it made me feel (like a bit of an idiot really, not good enough for him, etc.) He was impatient with me and explained that it wasn't that deep for him and I shouldn't overthink things. I felt a bit stupid but we were seeing one another later that night for date night (we'd planned this all week and it was the only night that week we'd seen one another due to busy schedules). Anyhow, he cancels this and says ""I'm just not in the mood for it anymore after all this"" making me feel guilty for calling him out on the selfie-liking thing. I feel upset because it didn't feel like anything was resolved and it just further strengthened the insecurity that he didn't care about me, I asked if I could just come round for an hour to sort things out, but he said no.

He said we couldn't see one another for almost 14 days (despite living just 15 min away) bcos he has exams to revise for. Fair enough he has exams, but could he not find an hour in his schedule to put things right with me and just get back on good terms? To me some things just need to be resolved in person and not over text. He refused and said he had to revise, which I tried to be understanding with because I know his exams are important. 

But during this period of time he was still finding time to hang out with friends, play video games, watch netflix, gym etc. but he couldn't see me for an hour. I asked 3 times if he wanted to hang out but again he declined so it got to the point where I stopped asking because I felt stupid. And I'm not one to beg someone to let me be a part of their life. 

I once messaged him ""missing you"" and he didn't open the message for 6hrs despite being online and commenting on posts etc. I know he was just sat at his PC, so why couldn't he just take 5 seconds to type a quick message back? 

Little stuff like this has built up over the week and tonight he was coming to mine before driving us down to his hometown to meet his family for the first time. It's been planned for a while and I was excited for it. He gets here and I feel really awkward and uncomfortable around him because he's acting like everything is okay but I've had all the stress of this past week on my mind and feel unsure if we're even okay as a couple.

 I explain that I can't go spend the weekend staying at his fams house (for the first time which is a nervewracking thing for me) whilst we still haven't addressed any of the past week or the fact that I feel like he doesn't care about me.

&#x200B;

He's mad because he didn't realise there was anything wrong and I've ""ruined a good night"". I also know his parents bought food for me and were expecting to see me. But how can he expect me to act happy and okay after basically ignoring me all week and despite *telling* me he likes me, doing absolutely nothing to show it?

Who is in the wrong here?"
598,deer7k,"AITA for not being thrilled that my parents came to visit? I’m (19M) a current student at university. My parents live in the next province over and are a 3ish hour flight away. I usually go home during winter hols, and this all happened about a week ago.

Two weeks ago during a call, I was talking about how I had a lot of midterm exams coming up and generally venting. My mom made a joke that went along the lines of “You sound stressed, we should come see you!” I laughed, but then explained quite seriously that I really was busy with school and my job. My days are just packed with library study sessions/shifts and I pretty much only see my friends when we study together. Even if they came to visit, I wouldn’t have the time to see them much because I’m still learning coding and it’s taking up a shit ton of time. I promised I’d go back to see them during hols and was saving money from work for the ticket. 

Fast forward to last Monday, and they showed up at my door for a surprise visit. Apparently they’ve been planning it a while and just didn’t want to let me know because “it’s a surprise!” My friends all thought it was a really sweet gesture, and I do slightly agree with them. But I was conflicted because they want me to show them around the uni town and surrounding areas (there’s a few nice touristy churches around) and I just don’t have the time. I packed my days with class & shifts that I can’t back out of without adequate notice. They wanted to have meals with me but I usually eat lunch in lecture and dinner on shift because again — no time. 

I gave them a few good brochures to the area and said I can’t see them until the weekend. They were pretty hurt and said I can move my studying slots, but I didn’t because I didn’t feel prepared for midterms. We had a lunch together on Saturday (no class) and then they had to fly back. 

A few friends called me an asshole because “family should come first” and I honestly don’t know if I handled it right. I also feel guilty because I know they had good intentions ans I more or less just blew them off. AITA?"

She posted about how she was going to have to “get rid” of one because he was terrorizing the other cats, trying to play and taking it too far. I thought he was adorable, so after a couple days I messaged her, asking about the cat. TW told me nobody had wanted him, and if she couldn’t find anyone to take him she was going to take him out to a back road and dump him. So of course I took the cat. 

Fast forward to now, almost a month later. His name is Stub and he’s an adorable,  affectionate, pain in my ass. I ended up getting a kitten for him to play with, and they get along great. :) The other day, I got a random text from TW, asking me if she could have the cat *back* because apparently, her seven year old son couldn’t accept that he’d “run away” as she’d told him, and was inconsolable about it. She claimed he was still leaving cat food out and calling the cats name in the backyard at night, and just really laid it on thick. I haven’t responded yet.

601,b656e9,"AITA for lying to charity? Bit of background. I’m a university student in the UK, who doesn’t have any money. The two typically go hand in hand. 

I was walking down the highstreet from a food shop, and I was stopped by a young lady. Yeah she was pretty so maybe that contributed to why I stopped, but she also pretty much blocked my path and started speaking to me straight away, despite having headphones in and arms full of shopping. 

She stopped me to tell me about a charity that helps families of people who are severely ill, now as a person who comes from a family with a seriously ill member, I can tell you that these charities don’t do as much as they promise. 

She was telling me about the charity for about 5-10 minutes and then the sledgehammer came. We both knew it was coming, she asked for a donation. Now I don’t mind giving cash or coins because, for some reason, they don’t really feel like money, you know what I mean? I’ll give a couple coins to the homeless man or put a pound in the charity box, that kind of thing. 

But no, she was asking me to set up a direct debit every month. Being a socially awkward male talking to an attractive woman, I buckled and said ok. She started adding my details and had a massive smile on her face and despite all this, every detail I added into the tablet she was holding was false, name, email, phone number. The lot. Then she asked to add my card details, I was gonna lie about those too, until she got the camera out. It was gonna be one of those ones where it scanned the card details. Fuck. 

So I did what any sane person would do, I lied about not having my wallet and texted my flatmate to pretend like it was locked in my room. I called, put it on speaker and we performed an Oscar winning performance of ‘the missing wallet’. After that I swiftly walked off ashamed and guilty, but I also felt she was a bit unfairly pushy and trapped me in a corner.

Somewhat childish i started singing along loudly to my music so that he couldn't hear his call and he hung up.

603,an33ff,AITA A yelp review led me to block a best friend Hi this is my first post ever so If im doing this wrong let me know. This all started Saturday. I wanna say that when it comes to restaurants I'm a good customer. I don't care if your busy and I always tip 20 percent because thats how my mom raised me. how ever my friend typically hates to tip and is overly critical of wait staff. So I go up to a friends at my old college. I was really looking forward to returning to a favorite bar for dinner. This place doesn't take reservations which I get but they do take call aheads. Before we leave I call to try to get on their waiting list only no one picks up we call two more times just to see still no answer. The automated phone call however says we can go online and put ourselves on the list so I do that. we get a text saying its a half hour wait which is perfect. We drive over an notice the place is packed. Pretty normal on a sat. I walk up and tell the hostess were here and she says she doesnt have us on the list. Confused i show her the text and she looks in her computer again and says the site isnt connected and kinda has an attitude about it. (but like i said its really busy so I bet she was stressed) My friend we will call Stacy goes up and tries to see if there is a spot at the bar. There isnt. she finds this table that doesnt look like a table and tries to get us to sit at it. After our friends point out its probs not a table she then wants to see if she can get a couple to switch with us so we all have room at this point me and my other friend are dying of cringe at the idea of it. I convince her that it is best if we just go somewhere else since its a two hour wait and there really isnt anywhere to wait. As we are leaving Stacy is visably angry she said really loudly next to the poor hostess that is was clear she wasnt sorry (She was) . And I was annoyed as well but not at anyone just the fact thatthe advertised this system that doesnt even work. fast forward to this morning. I was talking about it with my friends and I decided that it might be best to just right a review about the how they shouldnt advertise an online waitlist if it doesnt even connect with your seating computer. And i did. I told my friends i did this and stacy lost her fucking mind. she said why would I do this and it will accomplish nothing and I am making things harder for her because she is a regular there. I start getting more and more annoyed especially considering stacy brags about how she will cause a scene at a restaurant to get what she wants and how she treated the hostess last night. She is getting more and more bitchy about it till I delete the yelp review and then tell her not to talk to me for awhile because i was really mad and felt she was being hypocritical. Instead she tells me she will send me this long ass message about how she feels and her side. At this point I snap. like full on hulk. I jump down her throat tell her not to talk to me and if i cant give my opinion then she can't give hers. (immature i know) I tell her to stop messaging me and not to talk to me and she keeps blowing up my phone so I blocked her number (I have anxiety and the idea that she was just gunna keep pushing was really overwhelming me) I just feel like she has no right to judge me for a review WHICH WAS STILL 3 STARS. if she is gunna behave tlike that am I the ass hole here?
604,7dy89e,"AITA Wanting to Sell this ring? So around 2011- early 2017 I was in a very serious relationship with a guy. He started out great and then things went downward as he increasingly became more insecure, more controlling, more abusive, etc. Things got very dangerous a couple of times, but we had become so invested in each other that I didn't see a clear way out that wouldn't be horribly dangerous. Around our last yearly anniversary things picked up a bit and I thought it was going to get better for us. He even picked up a promise ring for me from a local jeweler.  
  As abusive cycles go, it got bad again. He would constantly use the ring against me as something to coerce me into doing what he wanted and giving up my position in arguments. Before I left for college I broke up with him.
  One of the last things he ever said to me was ""Please don't pawn the ring."" It's been about six months since we broke up and in order to get over the trauma I'm just trying to remove all signs of him from my house and, being a poor student, I could really use the 300+ dollars the ring is actually worth.

605,bm609e,"AITA for skipping class? For context: I'm in graduate school. I'm taking two classes relevant to this story: one meets in person every two weeks (taught by Wanda) and one is an online course (taught by Peter). 

Peter's class was meeting in-person for the first and only time to give presentations as a sort of final project. They were group presentations and worth a fair bit of our final grade. Unfortunately, the majority of the class voted on a time when Wanda's class was happening. ""Not a big deal,"" I thought, as we'd finished most of our major projects in Wanda's class.

I ran into Wanda in the hallway while talking to a friend on the day of class and decided to tell her then that I would not be able to make it to class because of this presentation in Peter's class. 

She had an immediate negative reaction and seemed to believe that I was doing this because Peter is a male professor and thus more worthy of my time. I tried to explain the grade situation, but she didn't seem to care.

I met with her a few moments later in her office to both try and soothe things over and see if she was available to discuss a research project I had been working on with her sometime tomorrow. She told me she was in a bad mood and said that if I wasn't going to respect her than why should she let me work on the research project?

At this point I was simply shocked. To me, skipping a class once should be avoided, but I also don't take it as a sign of disrespect (I'm a TA). Still, I apologized, told her I understood, and left to finish practicing for the presentation with my group member in Peter's class (and for what it is worth, the group member is a woman).

A few days later, Wanda shared a research article on social media about students respecting male professors more than female professors and added how a student had ditched her class the other day in favor of a man's class (obviously referring to me). Many people have responded with questions and comments that put ""the student"" in an increasingly bad light and her responses to them only support this fictionalized version of our encounter.

 While she did not explicitly use my name, she only taught one class this semester and everyone else was in attendance. At least a dozen people could easily suss out the student she was talking about here - online and in public.

At this point, I am feeling simply devastated. I considered her a mentor and a friend for years before this exchange. I try to advocate for women and am researching sexism, but now I'm essentially being publicly humiliated for being a sexist.

All that said, I definitely could have handled skipping class better. I should have talked to her in advance and tried to work something out. But I still feel like I'm receiving a disproportionate response."
606,c88vlb,"AITA for not telling my MIL there was a skunk outside when she was leaving our Airbnb ? She'd been awful to me and my pregnant wife all day long. My wife and I are on a baby moon to a really cool town in the mountains of New Mexico. We are staying in a modern condo Airbnb but it's right next to an Indian reservation which is some of the most grievous untouched nature I've ever seen. As such we've had raccoons and skunks wander through the property many times. 

My MIL and SIL decided (without asking us) that they'd join us and found the condo right next door on Airbnb. My MIL drives the only auto driving Tesla I've ever seen so I about fell over when I saw what had to be her car in the parking lot. Yesterday was thier first day and my MIL spent the entire day reminding us how we don't make enough money to have kids and live in a ""proper"" neighborhood and that I was selfish for not taking the job my wife's step dad had offered. Then she berated my wife all day for her food choices. And to top it off she wanted to argue about current affairs. We had wanted to hike but my wife got sick so we were completely stuck.

At like 8pm, MIL finally decided she was going to her Airbnb. I had just come in from the trash and there was a skunk in the parking lot. I didn't say anything because I was terrified MIL Might stay longer. MIL left and in like two seconds we heard a piercing shriek. I told my wife not to go out there because of the skunk. One of the permanent residents heard the scream and came out and was coaching my MIL to stay calm but from our balcony it looked like my MIL was backed against a wall with Pepe l'pu staring her down. It was one of the funniest things I've ever seen so I started laughing so hard. My wife asked me if I knew the skunk had been there so I said yes and that MIL deserved it after she'd been such a pain all day. After a couple minute ""stand off"" the skunk got bored and wandered off info the darkness and MIL didn't get sprayed.

My wife is really mad at me. She acknowledges that MIL overstepped, showed up unannounced and was rude all day long but I shouldn't have gotten revenge using a potentially rabid and defintely smelly animal.

Was I the asshole?"
607,cj7233,"AITA for not sharing my refund? I'm a teacher living in South Korea. I also happen to be a rave enthusiast who loves music festivals, so when I saw the lineup for Ultra Korea this year, I purchased my ticket as soon as I could. Fast forward to a few weeks before the festival and I realize that the weekend trip to Seoul is just going to cost me way too much money, mostly due to transportation. My friend and I decide to try to sell our tickets online so we start posting to social media groups until we both manage to find buyers for our tickets. Now, at this point, tickets for the 3 day festival are pushing $400 after all the taxes and fees, but I sell mine for only $200 because I frankly just want to get rid of it. The sale goes through and I'm left with a loss of about $80 overall. Not bad considering how much money I would have blown going to the festival for the weekend.

Now here's where the issue comes in. The headlining group for the festival ups and cancels at the last minute- like no joke, a few hours before the doors opened the final day- which must have been a huge bummer to all the attendees. The festival owners felt bad enough that they offered partial refunds to the people who purchased 3 day tickets. According to their system, the ticket and the card on file both still belong to me as I simply forwarded the email containing the ticket to the buyer, meaning the refund (of $80) will go back onto my card. At first I thought, oh cool, now I get to break even on this whole thing and that was that. But, a couple days after the refund announcement, the buyer of my ticket sends me a lengthy message saying he has the right to the refund and that I should give it to him, to which I replied... no. I've already lost money, and now he wants me to give him the refund?! This has escalated to him filing a claim against me with PayPal to try to force me to pay him the refund. So while I wait for their decision on the case, I have to know, internet, am I the asshole for refusing to give him the refund?

&#x200B;

Edit: Just to clarify, the buyer did attend all three days of the festival and flew from Canada to Korea to do so."
608,a1qf57,AITA for asking the tutor to close his phone and lower his voice becuase of my ear being in pain? AITA Every Friday I have this same calculus teacher come and teach me and strengthen concepts of the lessons for the AP calculus exam. I have a final exam (not the official just for school marks) this Tuesday sooo there isn't really another time for practicing and stuff I am extremely tight on time and the tutor knows that. I wrap my head with a bandana today cuz I'm feeling nauseous and to me wrapping my head makes me feel less nauseous and more focused. I opened the door for him while wearing a Red bandana don't think it's a problem and when he notices it he laughs at it for a second. i tell him I'm sick and have a painful ear infection and a bad case of strep throat. I tell him I organized all my books and papers for the upcoming finals (You know just small talk before we start the lesson) I Also tell him that one ear is almost deaf and in pain especially when hearing loud noises. He says that he had it last week but it wasn't as bad as mine. So he explains to me the new chapter before we start solving and I  ask him to repeat some points in the middle because I have a short attention span (I have ADHD which was diagnosed by psychologist). He's doesn't seem bothered or anything and repeats the terms normally. Now we start solving the test and he gets a notification on his phone And it is too loud and starts hurting my ears (the sound he has set for his notification takes time to finish). I just ask him if it's fine if he can just lower the volume for his notification because my ear is in actual pain and the volume is too loud. He closes his phone rigner and made no complain or negative reaction about it. We continue solving the questions he asks me look at the table he gave me I ask him If it is fine if I can try solving without looking at the table directly becuase understood how the table works and he explained it. I also wanted to try solving first without the table to see if I completely grasped the concept. He says fine with again no negative response and I proceed to solving this one question. it's a multiple choice question and I explain my answer to him (tried answering the question twice because first time I got the answer wrong) and he starts shouting at me telling me you should be looking at the table. He then continues shouting at me with a louder voice when I tell him that I understand it is my fault and I just really wanted to atleast see what my level is and what I should focus on. I just try to ask him respectively to lower his voice a little because my ear is in pain. He gets pissed and is like if you use that excuse one more time I'm leaving and that I'm acting as if I'm the teacher and he's the student telling him stuff like close ur phone and lower your voice. I start apologizing and telling him it is my fault and that I will not bring it up again after a few seconds of silence I try to bring us back to the topic of calculus. He stands up takes his keys and says I'm not doing this anymore then barges out the door. I was apologizing through the whole process of him getting up and everything. Through this whole thing I did not increase my voice becuase the pain of having a strep throat is extremely painful and increasing my voice would only make it worse I was talking in a low understandable tone (but not low to the point of whispering). 
609,cvj7l2,"AITA for Reporting a Customer to My Boss? I work as a busser at a restaurant. Recently two customers have been coming to our restaurant. One, an older lady, and the other, someone I presume to be her son.

They’ve come in 3 times that I’ve worked and each time the lady vomits at the table. She’ll vomit on the plates and in her napkins. Each time, they leave without telling any staff that she vomited. The first few times I touched vomit without gloves because i had no warning. Now I wear gloves because I know what to expect.

I assume she has some physical disorder that makes her vomit after eating as well as a mental disorder, but her son doesn’t do anything. He doesn’t direct her to the bathroom or clean up after her. He just watches her. 

Today was the third day I had to clean up her vomit and i’m just fucking done. I understand if it’s a one-time accident, but this is just becoming an hazardous expectation. I also had a customer complain about the noises the lady made when she was throwing up. I went to my boss and told him that a customer was coming in and continuously vomiting at the table every visit while not notifying any staff. He seemed very concerned and said he would have to look into it. Now she might be banned from the restaurant.

Am I the asshole for reporting this woman? I feel bad because she seems like she has dementia, but I’m really getting tired of cleaning up vomit."
610,e5a6dk,"AITA for a dog park back and forth ""altercation"" I was at the dog park last week. This park has 3 area's open in the winter, 1 large dog, and two small dog areas (25 lbs or less). However small dogs can be in the large dog area as long as they can handle it. I have a medium sized dog, about 40 lbs, so of course we were in the large dog area. He's young and likes to run, but I always watch him like a hawk. I brought my friend and her dog with me for the first time and we were enjoying wandering around and letting the dogs play. We ended up chatting with an older couple who had an elderly, smallish (maybe 20lbs?) dog. The conversation was pleasant enough and we parted ways. Almost immediately after we parted my dog decided to wander a bit and accidentally ran into the elderly dog knocking it over. I immediately called him back and apologized to the owners, the husband swatted/screamed at my dog, even after he immediately headed back towards me when I called. I explained that he is young and sometimes doesn't look where he was going. The people continued to insist that my dog was unruly and hurt their dog and yada yada. (I took a look at the dog it was completely fine, wagging its tail and carrying on...)To which I finally replied, if you have an older dog who fits into the small dog category and can't handle the sometimes more rambunctious nature of younger pups in the big dog section, perhaps they should hang out with the smaller dogs. I felt bad at that point for snapping but ended up grabbing my dog and my friend and leaving, now I'm a bit worried to go back.

611,cv1ka7,"AITA for not accepting my parents calls at a very public place? So im going to college, and it took about 8 hours to get there. I message my parents that ive arrived at the airport and was going to get on the shuttle. Now, the shuttle was packed with other college kids and they were doing their own things with their phones and stuff. Then i get a call from my dad, probably to see how the trip was. But the person sitting next to me on the shuttle was sleeping and i decided to decline the call and mdssage him that this isnt a good time to call me right now. Then he calls again. I decline. And i say that i am on the shuttle with a bunch of people sleeping and i dont want to wake them up or bother them. Then when the shuttle made its first stop, i got off and called him, he was pissed about how i wouldnt pick up his calls and that family is more important than random strangers. Now, in my head, i thougbt it was common courtesy to not make calls when people are sleeping and such, especially in a confined space as the shuttle bus. But yeah, i got yelled at for that.

612,dwcmjp,"AITA for getting breakfast? Lately we haven’t had much money due to doing some work on our house. I’ve had a few problems with food in that I can’t face eating very much at all because I’m due to give birth next week and have had problems with late pregnancy nausea. 

Despite that, I’ve continued to cook for my family. 

My husband is a little picky with food. Each week I ask him what he’d like. Breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack options. I ask him weekly because he complains that there’s nothing he wants to eat. I ask him at those times what he’d like (so I can stick it on the list) but he says he never knows - unless it’s fast food. 

I offer to make him whatever he wants, whether I’m sick or not. I just want to add that I am a good cook- everyone likes my food, my husband has invited people for dinner before to ‘show off’ my cooking and I’m often asked for my recipes or food requests are made of me. I’m only stating that in case people think my husband just doesn’t like my food. 

He has got angry before that “there’s never anything to eat” even though there are snacks he does like or if we’re low or out of something he’ll say he doesn’t know what he wants.

My husband has been hankering after ‘something’ for breakfast each day this week. I wake him for work each morning, get his stuff ready, give him a lunch to take with him, offer him breakfast. He almost always declines because he only feels like a fast food breakfast. As I said, money has been tighter than usual so he hasn’t eaten out. 

My MIL sent a little money just as a sweet gesture to, in her words, get something nice for my husband, me and the kids. I knew he’d would buy cigarettes because he was saying he had nearly ran out. He had refused any food in the morning before work, I hadn’t eaten properly in a few days, the kids were home sick. I don’t have a car and it was raining badly. I felt really hungry  and placed a small order for delivery from a local brunch place for breakfast for me and the kids. 

When my husband came back from work he was pissed. I had truly assumed he’d grabbed something from a place he likes alongside his cigarettes. He threw the cigarettes when he was telling me off for ordering. I explained that I was sorry for annoying him or making him angry and he said that I didn’t care if he was out working on an empty stomach but could get food for me and the kids. 

I don’t know what to say to make things better? He didn’t want to hear any apology. I explained that if I had thought he hadn’t got something for himself, I wouldn’t have got anything for myself. I offered to make him something straight away and he didn’t want anything. 

I feel conflicted because I often go without a lot of stuff I’d like or need but he doesn’t mind buying cigarettes or weed. I rarely say anything about that because it pisses him off. 

I don’t know how to fix this."
613,drfyuo,"AITA for telling cousin how much I make and making him “look like a fool” Hello redditors!

Well, I have this cousin that I meet once a month at our monthly family gatherings. He have asked me how much I make in front of the entire family about 5 times now on different occasions. He works in the steel business and have problems making ends meet and usually talks about this. I don’t like him and I have never liked him since we were kids. Well, however I work in real estate and I have been fortunate enough to make a fair amount of money. So the last time he asked I cracked and told him flat out how much money I made last year (high 6 figures). I was about to start ranting if he is happy now etc but my wife stopped me.

Well here is the problem, our family is very close and now somehow people seem to think I should pitch in and help him with money so he can keep his apartment. I don’t want to do that, when I refused I got called capitalist swine and all these other things by other family members. 

My wife thinks I should help him keep his apartment to not make family gatherings awkward in the future. 

Should I do this? Am I an asshole if I don’t give him jack shit?

Thanks in advance

Edit: forgot to add I did give a fair amount of money ($25k) towards another cousins wedding last year and this is used as leverage for me to help him with his apartment. As I said I don’t like him and could not care less if he ends up on the streets.

Edit 2: the “end up on the street part” is an exaggeration. I thought that was clear - I’m sorry"
614,cv6olo,"WIBTA if I reported my ex to the police over an instagram post My ex and I had a really ugly break up. We haven't talked in a while, but some of my friends still follow him on instagram. Recently, someone told me that he got into a really minor car accident that he was laughing about on his car instagram. In the post, he stated that he had had a seizure while driving resulting in some minor damage to his car. I don't think he has any intentions of reporting this accident or reporting the cause of it. 

I don't know if he's changed, but when we were dating, he was an awful driver. He'd regularly go 140MPH on the freeway to scare me as a joke. He swore up and down that he was an experienced driver and that I needed to trust him. He did not have any seizures when we dated, but I know they were an untreated childhood issue that had the possibility of coming back. When we dated, he had a seizure scare and refused to go to the doctor because he didn't want his license revoked. 

WIBTA if I reported him? I know it's not ""my business"" anymore since we're no longer together, and honestly, I'm not sure if me doing this is partially out of spite for how awful the relationship was or not, but I'd hate myself if something like this happened again and someone innocent got hurt.

Edit to add that me saying he went 140 to terrify me as his idea of a joke was to give you an idea of what kind of person he could be. He was abusive, and I am terrified of any retaliation that could come out of this tbh. I know I am a coward for not doing this previously, but he was and is still someone who terrifies me. I'm not doing this purely out of spite, but I am unsure if some spite might (keyword: MIGHT) be part of my motivations to report him. I will either be filing a report to the DMV or calling the nonemergency number later today."
615,9r4pjq,"AITA because I can’t control my emotions and my boyfriend can’t stand it? So I’ve been with my boyfriend for the most part of this year, I am 21 and he is 27. We’ve had a rough start but he’s been my friend for a very long time now. Only since the start of the year did I realise that sometimes he can turn very nasty and say hurtful and inconsiderate things. He has a short temper when it comes to his ego and becomes very defensive when it’s something that he considers an attack on it. Even when I’ve tried to explain this to him it’s another attack and it makes him really angry.

I’m a fragile person and seeing this side of him scared and confused me as I’d never seen it in him before when we were friends. I have had intense emotional problems in the past and have had some really trying times this year. He has also been through a lot however, and relates all of his and everyone else’s issues to his past, which allows him to not internalise his problems and to disconnect from strong emotions because of an “at least it’s not as bad as that” approach. It’s something I wish I could do but I’m not at that point yet. However I also think it’s more of an avoidant personality thing than actually dealing with your problems.

Our most recent fight was over something so trivial, he was annoyed at me - I was defending myself - he thought I was angry at him - as I was trying to explain I wasn’t angry he was barely listening and flicking through his phone on purpose - I started crying and asked him to not ignore me - he got annoyed so he got up and walked out - I followed still trying to explain myself - he was walking around the house ignoring me - I was trying to grab his hands to stop him so he would actually listen - he was telling me to get out of his house - I was becoming more hysteric I asked him to hug me - he hugged me but continued to say that me crying was a cop out and he has no sympathy - I left and cried in my car for an hour gathered myself, went to buy some groceries and went back to talk to him and explain that my crying is a reaction that I have no control over I’m not intentionally crying I know that it doesn’t help the problem at all - he didn’t want to talk to me and I didn’t have anywhere else to go so he told me I can either chill and sit out there with him or go into the bedroom so I went into the bedroom.

Hours passed and I was still crying, people came over, they were out there having fun. I wanted to go out there and get over it but my anxiety was holding me to the bed and I felt that even if I did go out there I would be a pain to them, that they wouldn’t want me there killing the mood. My eyes were all puffy and I had clearly been crying.

He didn’t come in to check on me once. I didn’t expect him to but I also would never do that to someone. I would never let someone sit in their sadness and anxiety the way I did.. 7 hours I was in bed. I felt pathetic and lonely.

I am a deeply empathetic person my ideals are to give people love, to always show support to someone you care about no matter how trivial it may be and to empathise with the way they feel. I hate acting silly and panicing for no reason I’m more aware of it than I think he understands and yet it’s not something that I can really help all that much. 

I finally messaged him to come and help me leave the room because I still felt anxious and he sat down to talk about it. He told me he is sick of this. That he has no sympathy for when I am like this and of course he’d be there for me for “real problems” but to him this is something stupid and he wants to give it no energy. The problem is that I can’t seem to do that and he genuinely can’t find even a shred of care for me when I am struggling with this. He thinks it’s just me being childish but I am hurting so so much. Sure the problem might not be real to him but to me it’s as real and as painful as it gets. He also claims that I don’t consider him when I start getting upset and how difficult it is for him which I understand and I try to consider him by leaving him alone or apologising for my actions but it feels like there’s no effort for that on his part.

He has told me I need to see someone and I agree but I would also like to see some support and care for the way that I am right now... am I an asshole for expecting this from him?"
616,aob0aa,"AITA for dating my ex's friend among other things? Necessary background:

I am a 17 yo guy, my ex is a 17 yo girl. We were each others' first love, dated for 11 months, broke up April 2018. We were on and off friends because I felt weird being her friend (still had feelings for her) until December 2018. She told me she regretted dumping me, and i still had feelings for her, so we went on a date. After the movie she said she wanted to be official again, so we were. A few days later, she came over to my house and we hung out. the day after, she tells me she made a  mistake and we shouldn't be dating.

This really upset me, because I had been grieving about our breakup for months, and the one time I justifiably have hope, it gets shot down because she made a hasty decision.

She told me after this that it is probably best if I don't talk to her again. Luckily, that is exactly what I wanted.

At the end of december, a girl who is acquaintances/ friends with my ex messaged me confessing that she thought I was physically attractive. Mid way through december I started recognizing that she was attractive as well. We went on a date on new years to get to know each other. after a few more dates we were really comfortable with each other, and things have progressed smoothly since. around mid-january, one of my closest friends tells me he's developing feelings for my ex. He wanted to make sure it wouldn't hurt me if something were to happen. i commended him for his transparency and said it was perfectly fine, although I would be careful and take things slowly considering what happened between her and I in early december.

A few days later, my ex tells me we need to talk. she calls me and we talk for roughly 40 mins about how she wants me to be friends/ on good terms with her. I tell her that's not going to happen after what she did. Being involved with her since the first breakup has done nothing but bring drama into my life. she keeps pushing and eventually asks why I don't want to be friends with her (since me telling her that having her out of my life makes things much easier wasn't enough), and I tell her I don't care about her anymore.

5 minutes of awkward silence, and we say goodbye.

Since then, every time I'm near her with my current gf, she makes rude gestures. I was walking with my gf in school and she covered her face from me. Yesterday when I was driving to my house with my gf (when she was walking with my close friend) she rolled her eyes at us.

The reason I find this so confusing is for 3 reasons. 1. She dumped ME. Twice. Now she's salty that I'm dating someone she associates with. 2. She literally tried to set me up with one of her other friends in the fall. Didn't progress because I wasn't feeling anything toward her. 3. She always told me, even after the second breakup ""I just want you to be happy"". Her actions show me she doesn't give a single shit about my happiness. 4. She's dating one of my closest friends.

&#x200B;

All that being said, am I in the wrong for telling my ex I don't care about her anymore, and dating someone who's associated with her? I know she hates me, but I think her friends do too, and I'm curious to see if it's justified since I can't really get the opinions of my friends at the moment."
617,b8ez1v,"WIBTA if I strongly recommended my roommate and I hire a cleaning service for our shared bathroom? So Reddit, last year, I graduated from college and moved to a new city. My roommate (F, 23) and I (M, 24) were acquaintances in college and decided to room together as she had also gotten a job in the same city. Soon after arriving, I started dating my girlfriend, who I met through my roommate (friend of a friend).

&#x200B;

The issue is, our shared bathroom has gotten so filthy I try my best to avoid showering at home – I shower literally anywhere else: my girlfriend’s place, the gym, my friends’ places. After my roommate showers, there’s just a thick layer of slippery soap scum and long hair. I slipped and slided around in the tub for months before giving in and buying a shower scrubber. I’ve bought every cleaning product in an attempt to reduce the slipping risk in the bathtub. If I have to shower at home, I spend a good 5 mintues before each shower trying to get rid of the soap scum so I don't have to step in it. 

I’ve mentioned it to her a few times, pretty passively (“Hey, I’ve had some good success with X product for the tub, give it a shot!”) trying not to actively blame her for the scum, but there’s really only scum after she showers – it might be the coconut oil or something. I've gotten neutral/negative response, no change in behavior.

&#x200B;

Would I be an asshole for suggesting we hire a professional cleaner? My girlfriend thinks that would be really passive aggressive, but there are some other areas that could use some cleaning (kitchen, living room) and I wouldn’t mind footing half the bill in order to have a clean home to return to. Part of me hopes she'll get the message and start cleaning up after herself instead. I’d like to reiterate that I don’t expect her to clean because she’s a girl – I clean up after myself in communal areas and just expect her to do the same (even though she makes more of a mess).

&#x200B;

I don’t want to piss her off/directly confront her since she’s in the same social circles as my girlfriend, and they seem kind of gossipy/cliquey and I don't want to do that to my girlfriend. And I don’t want to be an asshole, but I’d also like to shower in my house without having to clean up her mess. For the past 2 months, I’ve basically been in between staying at my girlfriend’s house or crashing with my friends 70% of the time in order to avoid my place.

Then the referee reversed the point, which would be mine, to simultaneous (as if it was a null point). But the referee, before resuming the match, forgot to take my point and I as an honest athlete informed the referee and so he took. But my dad who was watching hadn't seen that I was the one who told  to get my point out and he's kind of stressed and started shouting that they were stealing.

That’s a nice idea and everything but I don’t want anyone there. She is making me feel guilty, because my dad died about 4 months ago. My brother has been having a hard time with this (as have I, I mean I lost my dad while in the middle of pregnancy...) and my mom wants me to do something nice for my brother I guess? My brother has been looking forward to meeting his niece and might be pretty attached to the idea of being an uncle for the first time. Grief is weird, I know. And I also know that my mom probably cares more than he does about this. My brother, although might be a little disappointed, understands. But i feel like my mom is trying to guilt me. Keep in mind that my dad and her divorced long ago, and she is remarried. So I know this death might’ve been hard on her but it’s not fair to use his death to try and manipulate me. She called me after I told her no visitors at the hospital and asked why I changed my mind. She got emotional. But also claimed it was fine. Then she said “I’m not going to tell your brother.. he’s already going through so much and this will hurt him more”. I don’t want to feel guilty for my birth preferences but I’m starting to. AITA?



Edit: I changed my mind because it’s my first time giving birth. I didn’t realize all the things you have to do and I didn’t want to stress about visitors when I would be focused on a new baby and healing. I’m sure there’s a lot of info thrown at you at the hospital and I just wanted to keep it as simple as possible."
620,dql59g,"AITA soliciting competitors clients Hey so I’ve been picking up some slack on my fiancé’s business social media. To get more followers/ attention to his page I have started to follow large amounts of people from the area/ his demographic. Well there is another very similar business that started about a year after him, we currently run in the same circle as the owner and he goes after a similar demographic.
 So I’m following all these people on Instagram and get a bot to help. Then I get a message from someone saying it’s “classless to solicit a competitive businesses followers” then the owner of the other company and his wife post on their social media about how we tried to steal their followers. 
Now I’ve always tried to be really friendly with these people and we workout in the same place, where I also run my own business out of. I wrote him quickly and explained it was unbiased follows and not meant to attack him or his business. He never responded, kept his post up about us trying to poach and now I lost a whole night of sleep, thinking about what drama may happen within our social and business circles. We are all small business and self employed so I feel like it makes it more sensitive.

623,bjkna8,"WIBTA for stopping to talk to my (now former) best friends after they asked me to pay for their movie tickets on my birthday? TL;DR My best friends didn't go to my b-day party and then asked me to 1)Take us 2)Pay 3)Make the reservation for the movie they ""invited me"" to go after not going to the party, WIBTA for stopping to talk to them?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So, I have two very good friends (Andy and Gabriel) who we've known each other for about 7 years, we've traveled together and slept at one's houses countless times. But as we've grown things have changed, I got into uni and they haven't, so now they study full time for the SATs and I study and have an internship. It's normal for the daily contact to diminish, I get it.

My birthday arrived and so I invited them to a pizza party, none of them confirmed they would go and they were the only non-family members I had invited. I was bummed because I told them about 1 week prior to it that I would do it. Before I called the restaurant to make the reservation, I gave one of them a call and asked if he could go, he answered saying that he and the other friend would try to go. I got pretty disappointed, first because they probably wouldn't go to my birthday celebration (which is something I rarely do) I had told them about a week prior; and second because if there was something else they were giving priority to the other event (so they would try to go to mine); and third because they were doing it together.

After that I then invited 2 friends I hadn't seen in a long time about 2 hours before the party and they accepted on the spot, the party was great we talked a lot and it made me value more the people who value me.

Next day Andy sent me a message inviting me to go to the movies along with Gabriel to celebrate my birthday and they were sorry they couldn't go. I was happy they were trying to redeem but sad cause they didn't care much not to post pictures of themselves in a barbecue the night of my birthday party on IG. I accepted the invited because why not, they fucked up but bthey are trying to do something.

The day of the movies is today and first they asked if I could take them, I hesitated but ok no problem it's a ride I've given them countless rides. Second they ask me to see where we are going and what time (by now I'm angry, c'mon you invite someone and don't even bother to pick the place? It's a famous movie so most tickets are sold out). And last they ask me to PAY for the tickets. I was furious to see this message. I've paid their tickets and they've paid mine before, but sometimes they don't pay back the things I do for them, I let go because they are close friends, but I always pay them back. After that, I told them I didn't wanna go and stopped speaking to them. I don't wanna lose their friendship but this was really tough for me.

WIBTA for ceasing further contact with them?"
624,e4vw9e,"WIBTA by telling my friend that he’s being creepy? My friend D has been a school friend for about a year and a half. We’ve been in several classes together and sit beside each other. For a while now I've suspected that he has a crush on me. He often stares at me when I'm not looking, treats me differently from other female friends, always trying to find a way to be around me or makes physical contact and much more. We often talk about our weekends, plans after school, etc with each other. 

But I'm also close friends with one of his ex-girlfriends, S. S has been a good friend of mine for almost three years now and I know she wouldn't lie to me.

For the last couple of months, D recently found out that S and I were close and has been intruding in our friendship. He would often ask if we hung out. If I said yes, he would secretly go up to S when we weren't together and try to intimidate her to back off, trying to pry details about me or tell her not to tell me anything about their previous relationship. He used to be a complete asshole. Obviously, S didn't listen and told me what had happened. Also, ever since he found out we were friends he's tried to break up our friendship by making rumours about S. I feel as if he's trying to control me in a way. 

This has really been bothering me, especially since he's so persistent trying to unravel our friendship. I feel like he's being intrusive, nosey, and creepy. I want to confront him in the next few days to get his side of the story, tell him to stop, and that I'm not interested in him romantically. Am I overacting and WIBTA to confront him? 

If you have any questions or need me to elaborate on anything don't hesitate!

625,ea6ynk,"AITA at the Ravens football game? Cross posted on the Ravens subreddit but I figured I should post here. 

My brother, father and I are huge Ravens fans. We're from Baltimore and we've been with them since the beginning. Through the years from ""Who let the dogs out?!"" to now with ""BIG TRUSS"". 

Unfortunately we all lead busy lives and can rarely go to a game together. I've been to several games but last night was the first game I've ever been to with my brother. He's a pretty big and pretty loud guy so he's hard to miss. I'm the opposite as a small, quiet woman. 

I first felt anxious when on the opening drive, while Ravens were on D, we hear a yell from behind us ""HEY! DOWN IN FRONT!"" and the people a couple rows behind us asked us to sit down. I get wanting to sit and pipe down during offensive drives but this was us on defense! 

As the game went on, our section was really quiet. We were all the way up in 530 but everyone was pretty subdued most of the game- with the exception of my brother. The man is LOUD. He cheered every play. I was jumping up with him but my loudest volume might as well be a church mouse compared to him. There was absolutely no drinking or cursing involved so it was all PG (but loud) rooting for the Ravens.

At the start of the fourth quarter, people we leaving. The couple in front of us (who didn't say a word the entire game), turned around, looked my brother right in the face and said ""You're the most obnoxious person I've ever sat near in 25 years."" and he and his wife stomped off.

I haven't stopped thinking about it. I immediately feel defensive of my brother. Yeah, he's loud but in no way was he being belligerent. Should we have read the section better and piped down?"
626,cerocg,"AITA for telling a protester to get out of my way to class? This happened several months ago, was speaking about it to a friend so wondering whether I was the AH.

I (20M) in college. Several months ago a student group on the campus was doing some protest regarding sexism or something, some activist crap like that. I'm not politically involved in anything, doesn't interest me. I just go to class, party and work out.

So I was walking to class one day and this protest was blocking my way to class. They were physically blocking people from going to class. I try going another way and there's a protester there, who looks to be about 19 year old dude.

I tell him ''Get out of my way, I'm going to class'' and he starts rambling incoherently about whatever the fuck it is he's protesting. I say it again and he says ''No'' and starts rambling. 

I just look him in the eye and say ''Dude, get the fuck out of the way. NOW, or I will call the cops''. He looks a bit scared, at that point I knew this kid didn't know jack shit about anything, was frightened at the mention of cops. He gets out of my way and I go to class. No issue.

Now yesterday I was talking to a friend (20F) about this and she called me out for being an asshole. She said I shouldn't have done that as these issues are important. I said I don't give a fuck, my parents are paying for me to go to class and that's what I'm going to do. AITA?

**Edit - people bringing up my race, not sure why its relevant. I'm an Asian male, if that makes any difference. I got to College to study as my #1 priority and I hold a 4.0 GPA. The little free time I do have, is either on working out (to relieve stress) or partying (to have fun).**

628,dtkeu9,"AITA - my daughter's friend had an anaphylactic reaction under my watch On Thursday evenings my daughter (9F) goes to dance class with her friend Anna (9F). My wife told me to pick my daughter and Anna up from school, get them something to eat, and take them to dance.

I pick them up from school and ask where they want to go to eat. My daughter asks to go to this noodle place we go to sometimes, and I ask Anna if she would like that and she says sure, so we go. We all order and start eating, when suddenly Anna looks distressed and said she thinks she is having an allergic reaction. I ask her if she has allergies and she says she does to peanuts... and I look in her dish and it's clearly a peanut sauce.

I rush her to the hospital (we were pretty close so it was quicker than 911 would have been), and everything ended up being ok. I felt horrible. I call my wife when Anna is in the hospital room, but there is no answer and I do not have Anna's mother's phone number. So after Anna is given the all clear I immediately take her back to her house and explain what happened to her mother.

Her mother is furious, saying that I could have killed her child. I said back that she should have told me about her daughter's anaphylaxis, why would I assume something like that. She responded that you always ask about a child's allergies before getting them food. She also said that she didn't know I would be getting them dinner (School ends at 4 and dance isn't until 6, so I thought it would be safe to assume I would be giving them food..) I apologized for what happened, but still feel like Anna's mother definitely should have let me know in this situation, and also Anna is old enough to be aware of her anaphylaxis.

629,dpo97a,"AITA for playing my PS4? So a bit of back story, I've been with my partner for 2 years, and she has a child from a previous relationship who's 6, we get on like a house on fire.

 now the start of the problem sits here, I live a really simple life, I dont have many friends IRL and I basically keep my social interactions down to just my family and her family, and I love my life like that, living in a smaller circle makes me happier, but I have am intense interest and hobbie in playing my Playstation 4 which she bought me last xmas.

She used to say i played it too much, so we agreed that I'd play it every other day, which I happily do. Now i go away midday on Friday every week for work and I dont return home till the late evening on sunday, by which time I'm so exhausted I eat and fall asleep within an hour of coming home. 

The past week I played my ps4 on Monday night, which my gf complained at me about, as she believes because I played it Thursday before I left for work, I shouldnt be playing it then, (I ended up playing it anyway) Tuesday I didn't touch my ps4 as it was my off day, then Wednesday she then made it extremely difficult for me to play by creating at me and saying that she just didnt want me to play, which to me is against the agreement we made, then today, which is my off day, shes gone out to see her mother. 

Since she left me indoors alone with nothing to do, as I've said I have no IRL friends to speak to and majority of my friends are though PS4, so I cleaned up most of the house, then had nothing to do, so I decided that I was going to play some ps4, I even told her this over test and said I'd come off once she got in, she is now annoyed again, and having a go at me, saying I'm unfair and I shouldnt be allowed to play it my next on day, which I disagree with since whether I play it or not wont effect her life at all, since the moment shes back home with me I'll come off, she didnt offer for me to come with her today either so she just left me alone at home, AITA for playing my ps4 on the off day, even tho shes left me alone at home with nothing to do, knowing I have no friends IRL and I'll just be sitting scrolling though reddit all day? 

* a couple things to add is that when I do play my ps4 I play it from about 6-8pm till about 12:30/1:30 although sometimes I play alot earlier than that, I believe that's some of my time I'm taking for myself.
Just to clarify I financially support my SO and her child, I pay for everything currently as she is out of work, I also spend a considerable amount of time with her child, I spend all day 5 days a week with my SO and in the evenings I always cook dinner, every night, my SOs child father has a better paid job than me and works more hours than me, but decides to spend his money of drugs and other women then his daughter, so although I play my games I still clean, cook, financially and emotionally support my family and make time for both my SO and her child *"

I went to him when I need help but nothing changed and he said ""Sorry, you know I'm not interested with this course so I don't know anything, I can't help to you."" so I said ""Okay then, I won't share my project with you because I made every single thing on it.""

I told her it was a pride thing and that I felt comfortable for who I am and I wanted to express it and that I wouldnt make anything similar to it again and that it was just cause it was pride month you know

So anyway I removed it but I hated the fact I even had too, she also told me to remove the fact I said I like men in my facebook about me details

So I came up with something, I told her if I dont bring up anything about me being gay then you dont bring up anything in person or over messages about your religious beliefs and how you see homosexuality as sinful

She agreed but never followed it, I occasionally get videos or comments.

For example: I broke up with my partner

“Thats why you should date women.. just had to say it”

a bit of background info. At the time I was, still am, a card (magic the gathering)/ comic nerd, though thankfully I have taken up working out as well. I was living with my mom and younger sister at the time this event occurred. Lastly my parents are divorced, and when I turned 16 my dad bought me a card, nothing fancy, just an old beat up ford truck from the 90's, but she was mine and fully in my name.

whenever I wasn't at home I was usually hungout with my older cousin who played cards with me, or at my local game store (LGS) playing cards, cause when you play cards who has money for drugs? Anyway at the LGS we had a lot of inside jokes, much like any other place where a select group of people my frequently gather. My mother was not one of these people, she never came into the shop to talk to people or anything, in fact she made fun of my friends frequently through-out my time there. So one day she decided that she wants to go to the mall with my sister and I. Also I had to drive us there cause her car was low on gas. I'm not one for the mall because my mother will take forever, but whatever. We all get in my truck and start to head towards the mall. not 5 minutes into the trip a random inside joke from the LGS just pops into my head and I start to laugh. my mom who was in the passenger seat looks at me asks ""what's so funny"". I didn't really wanna explain it as it was a joke you had to be there for so I simply told her ""I don't think you will get it, its an inside joke."" she looks at my and goes ""ok..... pull over."" I pull over to the side of the road thinking she left something at the house. she then looks my dead in the eyes and tells me to ""get out"" I was a bit dumbfounded at the time, but I thought maybe she just wants to drive, so my dumbass gets out onto the road, leaving the key in the car, and starts to walk around to the passenger side. before I can get to the door, my mom is already in the driver's side. she turns the car on and proceeds to drive off leaving me on the side of the road. I then had to break into my own house, because she took my house key too as it was on my car key ring. I called my cousin to see where he was at, gathered my things and walk to my LGS where my cousin was so I can at least be with someone for the rest of the day. My mom stole my car, locked me out of the house, and left me on the side of the road.... all because I wouldn't tell her a joke she wouldn't get.

I'd first like to say I do not care if a dog shits on my lawn AS long as you pick up after it. The grass is just sitting there, use it as you please, just clean up after yourselves. So because I have this mentality, I walk around the neighborhood with my dog, and let her shit on their lawns (I ALWAYS PICK IT UP). I've even had the house owner watch my dog shit on their lawn and not say anything, I presume because I pull out a poop bag. So I've never been yelled at, also, people that don't want shit on their lawn put out that little 'no pooping' yard sign [something like this guy](https://www.amazon.com/Dog-Poop-Yard-Lawn-Sign/dp/B0051MPJR6)

So this morning I'm walking around the neighborhood, and my dog poops on this person's lawn (again right near where the grass meets the pavement) and there's no 'no pooping sign'. And I of course pick it up, and about to walk on our merry way, when this lady comes out of her car from next door (so not even the house owner) and walks over very quickly to me and yells ""DID YOU JUST LET YOUR DOG POOP ON THEIR LAWN?!"" and I say ""yes."" And then she goes on this spiel about how that person has babies and they play on that lawn, and do I really want to allow babies to play in the grass and then eat poo that could get them sick and that there are people around the neighborhood that are allergic to dogs and all that other good stuff, and that I should be taking my dog to the park that's close by (it's not a park, its an elementary school field that is also part of a church). After she ends her spiel, her face is red and eyes are crazy looking, and I really don't want to argue (though I have a rebuttal to every point she brings up - but I bite my tongue because i swear she's about to foam at the mouth) so I say ""okay"" and walk away, and even as I walk away, she yells back to me ""DON'T LET YOUR DOG POOP ON PEOPLE'S LAWNS, TAKE IT TO THE PARK, IT'S NOT THAT HARD!"" like I'm the asshole. 



Basically am I the asshole for not taking this ladys words to heart, and am going to continue to walk my dog around the neighborhood. I am not going to walk my dog at the school because she wants me to (because she thinks it benefits the neighborhood)."

&#x200B;

So last July, I joined Cadets so I could be with my friends. With Cadets you get two sets of uniform, a dress uniform and a camo uniform. I have received the dress uniform only in November (4 months after i joined) while all other cadets had received all of their uniform the previous month. On the first week of every month we all wear dress uniform but every other week we wear the camo uniform. I have been wearing the dress uniform for 4 months now and I have asked most weeks if any uniform has come through, they always reply with ""it's coming"".

&#x200B;

It sucks being the only cadet in my intake that still doesn't have their uniform, and I'm sort of the joke within the group ""hey PhoenixBekfast still doesn't have his uniform"" . I can't go on activities or do any of the fun stuff without the camo uniform. I have been considering quitting, and tonight I will be telling them that if I don't get my uniform within two weeks, I will quit, because it's been 9 months now and I can't keep doing Cadets anymore.

636,clp0nk,"AITA For not wanting to help my dad care for his pet? This happened about a week ago.

 I (26M) live with my father (67) in a small house along with a dog. My father rescued this dog from a shelter while I was in junior year college - my mother had passed away within the past year so I assume he got a dog to help cope with the loneliness. I came back home from break at college to this massive black lab mastiff mix laying on the living room floor waiting for his master to return.

I have never wanted much to do with this dog. I was not consulted about getting him. From the beginning, even when I would try to spend time with it, the dog (henceforth named Harper) would growl and bark at me. This caused me to keep him out of my room, keep a general distance. I am also allergic to dogs; whenever our family got a new dog, we made sure to get a hypo-allergenic breed for my mother and myself. So even when Harper eventually warmed up to me, I would find myself breaking out in hives any time I interacted with him.

I would still help take care of Harper when needed: feed him, change his water, brush him, and take him on walks. Things that his owner should be doing but for one reason or another hadn't done. But we've always had issues when it came to veterinary care.

Harper recently began having trouble walking due to some pain in his back leg. I noticed whenever I would try petting him he would be rather protective of his back right leg up near the hip joint. Harper would lay down in a spot and on the rug and not be able to get back up again, often trying to compensate with his front paws. We had been able to get him walking only after pulling him over to the door and helping him to stand before letting him out to relieve himself. This had happened a few weeks prior to this new incident, but seemingly healed on its own. Recently he's been exhibiting the same behaviors and has been bark/yelping for attention. 

I recommended taking him to the vet, and my father called to schedule a visit to the vet during the week. He asked me if I would be available to help, but since I work during the week I would likely be missing work to help get Harper to the appointment. From here, my father got angry saying that I should be there for support, even though he has proven capable of getting him up and moving by himself. I've mentioned to him before, that I wouldn't be the responsible party to take care of Harper if something happens to him. I'm happy to help him with some of the basic things but I firmly believe that Harper is my dad's responsibility."
637,b771wi,"WIBTA if I went Scorched Earth On My Boss  

So, I'll start this out by saying that my boss is an asshole. This is not up for debate, it is a statement, a fact, which not even Jesus Horatio Christ can deny. You will come to know him in all his shit covered splendor in a few moments.

For the better part of 2 years I have watched him turn my department into a revolving door of people who can’t stand to be around him. He once made a new hire, an 18 year old kid, quit his first job, on the first day, by screaming at him for what seemed like forever, but was probably only a couple of minutes. I’m talking spit flying, jabbing him in the chest with his fingers, like if Gordon Ramsay looked like Guy Fieri, and acted like Leona Helmsley. 

He once got on a fork lift and in a fit of rage rammed into a pallet at speed, sending its contents flying, then demanded that my coworker clean it up, alone, because he “shouldn’t have left this lift there.” It wasn’t his lift, and he’s not even a lift operator. 

He’s temperamental, rude, angry, selfish, and a bully. He’s a bad boss, and a terrible person. He demanded to be added to our work’s group chat, and then started flooding it with messages bragging about all the “super young pussy” he gets. Someone once made the mistake of telling him that none of us believed him. So instead he started sending us nude pictures of the girls that he takes home. Most of the time the girls in question are clearly sleeping in the photos, meaning they probably have no idea these pictures have been taken. Furthermore, I’m 29 and I would go nowhere near these girls. If they’re 20 years old I’d be surprised. Did I mention that he’s a 50 something year old married man. Now I’ve never met his wife, but you can bet she doesn’t deserve this shit.

I have, after almost 2 years, decided to leave my job. Now when you leave my job you are asked to do 2 exit interviews, one with the company’s HR, and the other with your union rep, and the union president for our location. I have decided to go scorched earth in these exit interviews. I have saved every shitty vulgar text message he has ever sent me, and after about a year working there I started keeping a journal of all the times he flipped out. I plan on handing these both over to HR and the union, and making damn sure they know that he’s the reason I’m leaving. This, I don’t feel bad about, I honestly doubt anything will happen to him in terms of losing his job or being disciplined.

I have also thought about sending a collection of his text messages to his wife. This is what I’m iffy about. I told a close friend my plan and he called me an ass hole. He said it’s not my business, and for all I know that’s their arrangement. Let me be very clear, I’m not planning on doing this because I feel sympathy for his wife. This would be solely because I hate my boss, and because he drove me away from a job that I actually really liked. So AITA?"
638,b3mutb,"AITA for changing my mind about having children? First post ever even though I’ve been on Reddit for a few years so please bare with me, also on my cell. To start, I’ve always wanted children, but in my family it’s apparently your “greatest accomplishment”. Background info: I’m the first female in my family to not have a child by 18. I’m a 33F have 1 kidney which is a transplant and 1 of my own that doesn’t function. Had a stillborn at 25. I’m raising my 16 year old niece for the last few years. I’ve recently decided not to have children of my own. My family doesn’t agree because it’s something I’ve always wanted and that’s not how they live their lives. Our family is based around the family and everyone having children and growing the family. I only have one cousin (few years younger) that doesn’t have children. If I had a child I would be in bed rest the entire pregnancy, so I wouldn’t be able to work to support my niece and I. After dealing with everything with my niece (who I love immensely and wouldn’t change having her for anything) and everything else involved, ex changing anti rejection meds until we find one that works for me & that wouldn’t harm a fetus. I’ve decided once she graduates I’d like to live the rest of my life doing things I enjoy &amp; things I’ve always wanted to do. I’m not willing to do dialysis or go on the transplant list again (waited 5 years for this one). I don’t want to leave a child without a mother and doctors can’t guarantee I’d survive to raise a child if I choose to have one. My family is extremely unhappy with me &amp; thinks it’s my boyfriend filling my head with bad possibilities (he’s never wanted children of his own but is great with my niece). AITA or selfish about deciding not to have children even though it’s something I’ve always wanted and still partly do, but terrified of trying?

639,au5og6,"AITA FWB bails, says we didn't have plans  I've been in this FWB situation for the past three months or so. It's been really nice in a lot of ways, especially after just getting out of an emotionally abusive relationship. My FWB is sweet and there's little pressure. Except for one thing - this pattern of mixed messages where he asks me to hang out and then bails right when we're supposed to meet up. 

The latest occurrence, for example. He texted me that afternoon asking if I was free later on that evening. I said I was, after I got out of work. He said text me then, which I did and asked if he still wanted to hang out. When I texted him, he asked how late I'd be up and was hanging out with friends but would probably be free in an hour. An hour goes by, at this point it's 10pm, and he says he's probably not going to make it , don't wait up. I'm angry, he says we didn't have plans. I go out with my roommates to dance it out, and guess who shows up to the bar with his friends? I didn't say anything to him then, because I didn't want to be a drunk and confront him about it. But I texted him the next day asking if we could talk and he still hasn't responded.

 If I knew earlier that we weren't going to be hanging out, I could have made other plans for my night. This is definitely not the first time something like this has happened and it's becoming a pattern. I've asked if he's just not interested anymore and he said that's not it. He had a death in the family recently, so I'm trying to be compassionate and understanding. However, my time is valuable too. Do I have unrealistic expectations? Am I misreading what he's saying? AITA?

640,d762lv,"AITA if I hide weed from my boyfriend? Hello, sorry in advance for any formatting, I am on mobile and fairly new to reddit. 

Anyway, like the title says, I (31f) buy and hide my own stash of bud and don’t tell my BF(33m). I only smoke in the evenings and on my days off and even then it’s 1 joint or maybe 3 if it’s a Friday or my days off. He smokes quite a bit more in the form of a “small” toke in the morning, bowl before work, bowl after work and then half my evening joint and a bowl on his own before bed. All this while next to never throwing any money down for said weed. I get a half ounce once a week. Usually it would last me damn near a month by myself. 

I’ve been feeling a little guilty because some times I enjoy a smoke on my own and he can tell. He assumes I’ve had one of my friends over or hung out with my brother and I don’t correct him. He has been getting a little more suspicious lately and making snippy comments about cheating and I shut that shit down fast but it has lead to some arguments. I’m just frustrated that I even have to hide this from him at all, really, and it’s making me angry at myself for feeling guilty about hiding it. Anyway, am I an asshole for this or should I stop feeling guilty and enjoy my smokes of solitude?

Editing for a more details: I have brought up to him that he rarely pays for weed and he says he will “next time.” The reason I hide some is cause he will smoke it all if I don’t and then I just paid for something I didn’t even get to really enjoy."
641,botofm,"AITA For Not Letting My Wife's Parents Move In  

Original Post [https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/bomg05/we\_raised\_you\_so\_now\_you\_should\_let\_us\_live\_off/](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/bomg05/we_raised_you_so_now_you_should_let_us_live_off/)

This story is about my wife’s parent and their ""retirement plan”.

A key detail: For years her parents have been pressuring us to buy a house with extra rooms. I didn’t know why until not too long ago.

So last year my wife explained to me that her parents were retiring early to enjoy life (they’re around 50). They sold their house and most of their belongings. Decided to spend their summers at the camper. So far so good.

But here’s the kicker xD - The basis of their plan is that they plan on living with their kids for the rest of the year where the camping grounds are closed. The grounds close in September so this means they need somewhere to go for the remaining 8 months of the year. Now I should mention that they only have 2 children; my wife and her sister. This is their plan…until they die. All their money is going to seeing the world and camping – nothing else. If they ever get sick and can’t travel anymore? You got it, its now your responsibility cause they’ll have no money for a special care home or nurse by then.

I told her that I’m not ok with this. We have a child and I’m looking forward to the day when we are done raising him and get to do the things we want. To me, living with her parents, seeing them every day, at every meal, watching tv with us…. Is a fuckin NIGHTMARE scenario. I do like them so that’s not the issue. I just don’t want to be burdened by an older couple that I would essentially be responsible to feed and house.

Thankfully, my wife totally agreed that it’s a garbage idea. We have our own life to live. They don’t show it much, but I can tell they are offended and feel rejected. But honestly, this is a take/take situation and when I get to be that age, I won’t have the luxury of living off my kid and I certainly would feel like a POS if I expected that of him. And no, you're not going to mooch off of me when I'll probably have to work till I'm 75.

So my question to you is; am I an asshole? I feel like if I’m going to work my ass off, I want to enjoy my free time. I don’t want to take care of an older couple that decided they should just quit their responsibilities and pawn them off on their kids who are just starting their married lives. The sister is ok with this and they spent all of winter/spring there but not without issues.

Personally, I feel this is a gross entitlement. Seriously… of course I would take care of my parents if they fell ill or on hard times…. who just decides to live off other people just because?"
642,df1aec,"AITA for quitting my job right before a big event Hi,

I work at a local university and I hate it. I've been here about 3 years now and I plan events and programs for students and athletics. I have a full load of work everyday and a micromanaging boss. For the first few years all was well, then we hired my new boss. In one year she and the new director have turned this office into a nightmare of tattletales and micromanagement.

&#x200B;

I've just received a new job offer at a large bank. Better pay, better hours. I will be accepting later this afternoon!

&#x200B;

Yesterday, I had one of my coworkers under me request a resupply of paper from the resupply guy. To give an example of how stupid this place is, the resupply guy sends my boss a message about how coworkers beneath me are not supposed to make those requests, even when I ask them... So my micromanager decides to have a meeting with all 5 people who I manage to see if I've trained them right. They've all been here 2 years...

&#x200B;

I feel as though upper management is trying to force me out with these made up ""infractions""

&#x200B;

Examples:

\-Not putting together meetings fast enough between 15 plus people. They said it should only take a couple hours.

\-Not putting every single item I'm doing on my schedule so they can track what I'm doing. I do to an extent, but not everything that would be a huge waste of time.

\-Getting upset when I leave the office to use the bathroom and not say anything.

\-Getting upset when an order takes to long to arrive (because I have total control of USPS...)

\-Getting upset when an item isn't ordered right away when they send an email. (because I'm not doing anything else...)

\-Getting upset that I take my full hour for lunch.

&#x200B;

All of this seems to have transpired after they learned I voted for The Donald in 2016. I'm not even a huge political guy, just an ex military goof. They tried to shame me by saying ""I can't believe you voted for the creep.""

I feel like that Blade Runner character everyday here. ""I was quit coming in here, I'm twice as quit now...""

&#x200B;

So yesterday after the whole ordeal of ordering paper, my boss came up to me and said ""you need to make sure that people under you are not emailing ""resupply guy"" because they don't the authority to message him."" That's all made up btw.

I looked at her, said ""sure, no problem, you can request those from now on...""

So I wrote on a sticky note ""two weeks notice.""

My manager flipped out and basically said ""you can't just leave when our biggest event of the year is next week! You're in charge of that! I can't do that event!""

&#x200B;

I told her that I would be taking leave next week via my vacation time and my last day will be this Friday.

She then said that ""I'm not giving you vacation next week."" 

So here I am at home today, sick

Edit:

If I don't take my vacation they will not pay it out in a check after I leave

643,dpq0c9,"AITA for not wanting to work from home? I live in a 1000 sqft condo with my wife and 18 month old son. I do not have a dedicated room for an office so i sit at a small desk in the living room when i do work from home. If i do not have anything pressing to do for work when i am home I tend to get distracted with odd jobs around the house that i do not have time for during non-work hours. I do these things when/if i feel i can fit them into my schedule on my time. However i tend to get annoyed when my wife and/or son ask for my attention when i am working. I feel like she does not see the difference of me choosing when i have time to divert my attention and when she asks for it.   
  
My wife has been tired and stressed the last few days for personal reasons, and she suggested I stay and work at home today so that I can clock out early and we can go to a Halloween thing in the evening with our 18 mo. I mentioned i had things to do today and wanted to commute (15 mins) into the office today, but she snapped at me for wasting my time yesterday on trying to replace the threshold at the front door that our son ripped up. She said something like ""i thought you would want to spend time with your son on Halloween"". My thought was I  still have to work during the day, so its not like we can go hang out. It takes me 15 mins to get home, and then we can go out. I tried to talk to her about it, because i felt that my working from home or not has become a sore issue and she was holding on to some anger or resentment. She escalated it by yelling at me and telling me i need to go in to the office because she did not want to see me today. She said was going to her moms (a frequent occurrence) and would be home late, so that i could have some time alone in the house after work.  She got pretty mad and didn't say goodbye before she left to go walk the dog with our son.  
  
Am i the asshole for not spending time there and getting annoyed when she wants my attention?  
  
Some of the other reasons i like to commute:  
-we just moved to a brand new building with nice new amenities.  
-I have taken up biking in to work, and i like the exercise in the morning.  
-I like to quiet isolation i have at my desk."
644,9xrqv9,"WIBTA for breaking up with boyfriend post major operation (and not seeing him if he wants me to see him)? (Obligatory apology for the long post, ended up being a cathartic release to type it all out)

Open relationship of 2 months, been relationship like and had sex most of the year. Met all his family etc, basically live with him. I help with house chores and our laundry, etc. He is 25. I'm 21. Incoming third person (Lana) is 23. I get along with my bfs family so well, his mum considers me as her own daughter and I go to extended family dinners and events. Lana and my bf work together.

We are in an open relationship because he has commitment issues after ending a 7 year relationship with the girl he thought was the one. Basically he wanted to buy a house, join bank accounts, have kids, and she wasn't ready. They also didn't make each other happy and were really codependent. Bf moved back home after the breakup at the end of last year. He said he isnt fucking anyone else and doesnt want to, and I believe him. It's okay with me if he does, just as long as it's not Lana (you'll see why below haha).

He was happy to be more affectionate, emotional, and boyfriend like, but to him a commitment is serious like you're either casual and not in a relationship or seriously thinking about a future together and working towards that. So this is what we ended up with.

He had an ACL and meniscus tear. Had surgery for it 2 days ago. Essentially, bed rest and crutches for at least the first two weeks. Intense rehab. No sport for 12 months, no gym for 2, etc. Very rough.

When he got out of surgery and woke up from the meds, he was like ""hey, Lana is coming to visit in her study break. But I'm so keen to see you. You're so beautiful"" etc etc.

Lana is his best friend, they used to be fwb. They are two peas in a pod and understand each other in an uncanny, mind connected way. Lana is in love with him and has issues with me, eg, she wasnt comfortable with me being there at the same time. She was the first one to see him after surgery, and the last one to see him before visiting hours closed. I visited in between with his mum and dad. 

I took him home the next day. Lana and my bf made plans to hang out then, so I disappeared but in an emotional huff. Basically I asked bf where I should put his stuff before leaving, he said bedroom, I put it in the bedroom, and he got annoyed because it wasnt upstairs. He dramatically expressed this. Tried to cut him slack because of painkillers and he just went through a major operation, but basically left in an emotional huff. Didnt stay to resolve it because if Lana saw my car there, she would irrationally lose her shit. It's happened before. He said he was disappointed and I responded with, I stay and I'm in the wrong, I go and I'm in the wrong.

He also said (when I pressed him) he prefers her company because I'm serious and argumentative.  (I am, except he was bringing up Lana for no reason and knew it would push my buttons, and I said so and asked him to stop, he didnt, and then he got mad that I was annoyed and sad. He also ended up fighting, separately, with his ex, Lana, and myself on the day of his surgery. I feel like that's more indicative of him just being an emotional mess and arguing.) He was talking about how we should break up because he cant cope with Lana and I not being ok with each other, and because if we will work it will be after a break from this because it's too much right now. I agree. I'm in love, he doesn't know that, and it's hard as fuck, but I agree.

He texted me yestersay saying he felt terrible about it all and that he would call when Lana left. He never called. He said he fell asleep. This morning I asked if Lana stayed over and he said yes. This cut me so deep because, again, he chose her over me. He swaps between saying how I feel (really fucking upset) is valid and this is all fucked up, and then saying it's not a competition with Lana. I agree it's not a competition, but I shouldnt always be second to her. It makes me feel shit as his gf, it makes my confidence take a big hit, I feel insecure and not good enough, and sad/depressed. This has only emerged over the last few days with his surgery stuff. I am not ok with feeling like this. Also feel preemptively embarrassed because she was there, not me, and his family might think I just dont give a shit when I've done everything I can for him including moving my flight dates so I can be here. (Surgery was planned for a different date but there was a last minute change.)

This is exacerbated, I think, because we broke up around 3 weeks ago because Lana was way too irrationally upset and was saying stuff like ""I will quit, I cant handle seeing you"" and ""we cant be friends"" etc and being verbally abusive to him. He isnt willing to quit, and isnt willing to give up his friendship. That's fine, I've never asked him to. It's not my place to do that. He ended up saying fuck it, no, this isnt right, she cant keep controlling this. I think this history just makes it harder for me emotionally.

This morning he said he doesnt want to talk, and that if I genuinely care, I would first want to make sure he's okay. He wants me to come over for company while Lana is there. He said Lana is ok with this. I would have been, but for her staying over last night instead of me. I cry or feel really sad when I hear her name or think about her. I'm not angry anymore, just really sad. Like I've spent a fair bit of my alone time crying. Cried on his surgery day when I wasnt the first to see him, after I left when Lana was coming to see him, yesterday arvo and then went out with friends to a bar, came back at 2am and cried myself to sleep. Cried when I woke up after hearing she slept at his. I'm exhausted and drained.

I've gone through a lot of family issues (parents on off divorcing my whole life, and mum abusing me emotionally and verbally). Been through therapy for a while, but my therapist just moved countries. If I was healthy, i probably would have left a while ago. But things were improving, and i used it as a healthy way to learn about emotions and relationships through discussing things with my therapist. I never thought I could fall in love in my entire life, and yet I have. Even through the worst of it all, I've grown and have learned how to deal with my emotions better (still obviously needs work haha). Just putting this here because I'm hoping it'll make the story make more sense and give context. 

Tldr; WIBTA if I breakup with a guy I'm in love with 3 days post his ACL and meniscus surgery if I feel really sad because he doesnt prioritise me? Not looking for advice, just very morally conflicted."
645,drw1sf,"AITAH for letting my coworkers quit because I got fired? A regular offered me $100 to take a shot with him, he has been drinking at the bar I worked at for over 10 years, I worked there for 4 years. I made a shot with sour mix and cranberry to match the color of his so he thought I was taking one. I just want to make extra money.

My manager happened to see this on the cameras. There is a strict no drinking policy at this bar for bartenders on the clock, and it’s a new manager who is trying to show her authority so she made an example of me and fired me.

There is no way to prove there wasn’t booze in my shot, I saw the footage and with the liquor gun we have right next to the pop gun there is no way to prove I didn’t put liquor in that shot.

I honestly don’t and didn’t care enough to argue with her about it. I’m about to start a new job since I graduate from school after this semester and am not to concerned about my future in bartending.

I trained basically every new person at this bar, and I was honest with them that I was fired in our work group chat. They all started saying if you got fired for that we don’t want to work here either. They were all saying bad things about the manager and how they want to screw the whole bar over by all quitting at the same time.

I told them that our new manager is balls to the walls. I said I’m going to be just fine, but not to make my same mistake and drink ANYTHING out of a shot glass because she is that concerned about it. I also told them to think for themselves and do whatever they need to when it comes to their jobs.

I then let my anger overtake me and I said “if you want to find a job where you don’t have to be constantly looking over your back and have to be worried about an insane manager find different bartending and serving jobs. You’re all capable people that don’t deserve a psycho watching over you when you’ve put good time into a work place.” I basically contradicted myself. 

I feel like I went over the top, my sister said I should’ve kept my mouth shut. But I explained the whole situation to the old manager, who taught me the “mix things together to look like booze so people don’t feel rejected when they buy you shots trick”. She thinks it’s crazy the new manager won’t trust me after training so many people in and my old manager loves me.

My old manager quit because she was moving away with her fiancé, but she told the new manager that I was trustworthy and I thought the new manager would have some trust considering I was basically running the bar when she came in. 

Whatever the case, AITAH for letting a lot of employees quit on my behalf? Because as of now 7/10 bartenders where I was fired from are planning a group quit. I don’t want the bar to close, but I want my manager to realize that she messed up..."
646,edgekq,"AITA For Not Getting a Job? I know my title instantly makes me sound like a dick but hear me out.

I am a recovering alcoholic. My relationship with alcohol for the last 5 years has been completely inappropriate. Most days of the week I would wake up, immediately start drinking gin, and not stop until I was asleep or vomiting. When I was too hungover to leave the house, which is when I would do freelance web design to pay my bills. I've hit rock bottom, and I had to get sober about 3 weeks ago.

I called my mom and told her. She was ecstatic. She hadn't known how bad my drinking had gotten, but it was pretty obvious for a long time that I had some serious problems. She offered to let me come stay in my old childhood room for a while while I started recovery. My mom is a nurse and I guess knows how difficult the first stages of sobriety are. Both me and my brother are moved out and my father passed away.

If you don't realize, going from heavy drinking to no drinking is pretty rough. For my first week, I experienced a swath of terrible withdrawal symptoms, ranging from a constant headache to random vomiting. Mom was very considerate during this time, mostly leaving me to my own devices and preparing meals and stuff.

I'm on week 3 sober, and the physical symptoms are gone. However, the tugging need for a drink is insane and inescapable. I'm doing a little web design here and there but I spend most of my day sleeping or distracting myself as best I can (with Twitch, books, etc.). I keep to myself, and my mom and I never fight until very recently.

My mother sat me down last night and was very adamant that I need to get out of the house and get a ""real job."" She says that now that my withdrawals are passing, it's better for me to get out of the house and interact with people more than over email. She says that the routine, set hours, and change of pace will help stop me from constantly obsessing over booze. I think it'll trigger a relapse. I offered her money for rent/to leave--she refused both. She says she doesn't need or want any money--she just wants me to avoid falling back into drinking. I told her I wasn't ready to try a 9-5 yet. She reluctantly accepted but clearly wasn't thrilled with my decision.

My adult brother called me the other night and asked me why I was continuing to ""mooch"" off our mother. I told him I offered her money and she said she didn't want it. He told me that I was obviously creating an emotional burden on her by constantly being in the house and if I was going to stay there, I needed to do what she wanted. He said that she didn't make me drink and that my shit decisions shouldn't impede on others lives.

Am I the asshole for not wanting to go out and get a ""real job"" outside of the house? I make enough money to cover my bills and put cash in spending now that I'm not too wasted to work. I am considering moving out but it seems like my mom does genuinely like seeing me."

I understand having to go and do research to further our academic careers and to keep our resumes looking good and feel, again, a bit bad for them. when I asked them about their trip all they said was it was fun and really liked where they went but, later on they let it slip that being ""out in the sun all day, building, wasn't as fun"" now I know for a fact this was not a research trip and was most likely a mission trip of sorts. this is a rather big deal because they know I am atheist and I wouldn't empathize (understand) their situation. 

 bells start going off in in my head because looking back I think our professor would have been a bit more lenient given it was research. anyway,  because I realized they lied to me and specifically told me it was a research trip and not church related (then I really would have said you are on your own), I shut down all possibility of communication because I know they want me to teach them stuff they could have at least looked at. I feel terrible because I feel like a shitty friend and I know they won't understand much but also feel like they were definitely just going to use me. 

so, aita for refusing to tutor my  classmate?

649,b73mto,"WIBTA If I Kick My Brother Out of My House? My (27f) have been living with my brother (32m) for the past 7 years. We've lived in the same house the whole time. 2 years ago I bought the house and have been renting it out to my brother and a roommate. Their rent is super cheap with all bills are included, and I haven't raised it even though my taxes have gone up about $400 a month in the past 2 years. I also pay for all the communal house supplies like detergent, paper towels, towel paper, etc.  I have also paid for pest control that he caused (I won't go into details because then someone might recognize him from the post), even though it wasn't my fault, wasn't in my room, and cost nearly $3000. He never offered to pay or to help out. 

&#x200B;

My brother doesn't have a college degree but he has a decent job as a warehouse manager. The problem is that he hasn't paid his rent on time in more than a year and a half. April is in 2 days and he hasn't paid me a cent for March. Every time I bring it up he says he is trying his hardest and he has anxiety. I know he could pay his rent on time if he tried. He never cooks at home, never takes his lunch to work, and goes out drinking with his friends at least once a week. And this isn't the first time he's done this type of thing to me. He rented my old car from me until it broke down for good and never paid for it. Nothing. He drove it for months.

&#x200B;

I feel like he's just taking advantage of me because I'm his sister and I'm getting sick of it. The extra money each month is really nice but I don't need it. I felt like I've e let him walk all over me. I think he needs a real kick in the ass. I'm done enabling him. I'm going to change the WiFi password and not tell him since technically he hasn't paid for it. I will give him the password when he is caught up on his rent. But what I really want to do is tell him the next time his rent is late, starting in May because there is no way he will be on time on April, that he has has a month to find a new place to live. My Dad has offered to employ him and give him a place to live for free, and my mom has told him that after my sister moves out he can live with her, also for free, while he goes back to school but he's chosen not to. Will I be the asshole if I tell my brother to grow the f up and pay his rent on time or he needs to find a new place to live?"
650,dx9ur3,"AITA for throwing his stuff out? I just got a call from ex and he wants the box of stuff (ticket stubs, old presents, a book, etc) that he gave me when we ended contact. This is all stuff that I either gave him or experienced with him. 

Now, I threw most of it out because I thought we were totally done and it was giving me anxiety to even have it around. I have a few mental illness diagnoses that make it hard to deal with stress like that and even though I’m not superstitious, it felt like a negative energy talisman. Under my bed, in my closet, anxiety radiated from it. So, I took out one thing and tossed the rest. 

Now he calls me and wants it back, which is fine, but he got upset with me for throwing the stuff out. I was calling it all garbage with my actions and he obviously cared about it and it was the wrong choice, etc.

651,bpkzxs,"WIBTA for ratting out my flatmate to his gf? I've [22M] lived with my flatmate [23M] for 3 years, and for 2.5 of those years, he's been dating his current gf[22F], who was at our university on exchange. Because of this, they've recently been dating long-distance but they visit each other around twice a month. 

The gf and I are not very close friends, although of course I have come to know her over the years, she sometimes messages me for help with coursework and the like. 

Recently, my gf[21F] and I have noticed - as our bedroom shares a wall with his - that while his gf is out of town, he's been having another girl [21F](who is a mutual friend of ours) over late at night. She usually comes over at 11PM or so and stays in his room all night and well into the next morning. They giggle loudly all night and if I were a betting man I'd wager they were having sex, although obviously i don't have proof as I've not been lurking.

The reason I'm posting is that when she came by last night, I heard her tell my flatmate 'I missed you' in a very affectionate way. 24 hours later (tonight) she's still here, and at this point, I'm starting to feel really bad for his gf.

So - WIBTA if I told flatmate's gf about his behaviour?

652,bn51ex,"WIBTA If I called animal control on my neighbors? I have a pretty friendly relationship with my neighbors. I wouldn't necessarily say we're friends, but we're certainly civil. I've been into their house a couple of times, and it is BAD. The mess in there is insane. There are drain flies flying around all over the place (and fly strips complete covered in them), food is left out, dishes out, clothes strewn about, and animal droppings and puddles. Let's get into that:

They have nine animals. In there. NINE. 
Seven cats and two dogs. One of the dogs barks constantly all day and night. And with good reason. He's always tied up to the table. He's a husky puppy so he definitely wants attention and exercise. 
The other dog can walk around as it pleases and goes out more often but not nearly often enough either. Because they're in the house so often, they shit all over the floor and when the neighbors open their front door, the stench that comes out sometimes.. ugh. 

I mentioned the dog barks a lot, but it's gotten worse over time. When I say constantly, I mean it's happening right now. They've started yelling at the dog. Cursing at it, threatening it sometimes. 

Now I don't ask if I'm the asshole for wanting the poor dog out of that situation, but because I know sometimes dogs in shelters don't end up well. 
However I also know that situations like that kill those kinds of dogs prematurely. 

I certainly don't want to put the dog somewhere they might kill it if these people have a chance of changing, and I also don't want to keep the dog in a bad situation while it has a chance of being adopted by someone more well equipped and loving. 

Should I mind my own business?

Edit: So it seems to be unanimous that I should make the call. Can I do it anonymously? I know it's the right thing, but I don't really want to be put upfront if I don't have to be."

Short story:  My company is doing a white elephant gift exchange during lunch on a Friday; there is also a requirement to bring food dish. I don't want to participate for 3 reasons:

1. I don't particularly like the group of people I work with. A couple of them are just A-holes.
2. My budget is very very strict and I can't deviate to satisfy a gift/food requirement for work.
3. In general I do not like being with large crowds of people.

I let the office administrator know I wouldn't be participating and she has been bothering me about it since.  Her comments have been:  
"" You're part of the team. You should participate""  
""If you don't participate then other people will think it's ok to not do it. We need to boost office morale and have everyone involved.""

I told her I don't really like being around lots of people at once and she just said, ""Well, we need to help you not be like that anymore so you should be there.""

AITA for wanting to be a loner?"
655,caubp9,"AITA for wanting my kids to be picked up from this wedding early? My brother-in-law is getting married in the fall. He and his fiancé want my kids (ages 8 and 10) to be the junior bridesmaid and ring bearer. I have no problem with them being that, and the kids are looking forward to it. However, outside that, they will be the only kids there. Outside my kids, they are not really “kid people”. Also, not a big deal to me. I had no kids at my wedding at all-not even for flower girls or ring bearers. 

However, I know my kids. They’re going to get bored if they have to stay for the entire wedding (the ceremony goes into the night). Because this is my brother-in-law’s wedding and my husband is the best man, I am a bridesmaid, we can’t duck out early. Plus, it’s going to be a lot of fun and an excuse to have a few drinks. So, my idea was that they would serve in the ceremony, take pictures and then we would have our usual sitter come grab them (wedding is local) and take them home for a movie night. My husband agreed that was the best idea.

When I brought this up to my brother-in-law and his fiancé, they got upset. They want the kids at the wedding for the whole time, so they can be in all the pictures and experience all of it. I explained that there will be lots of people there, plus they’ll be in the important pictures (the main group ones, the bridal party, family shots, etc.). That still wasn’t good enough. I tried to explain that they don’t get it, as they don’t have kids and they said that we’re just letting our kids get away with stuff, despite us not even asking our kids about any of this. Now my husband is trying to compromise (they’ll have dinner and leave before dancing), to save face, but brother-in-law and his fiancé are so pissed with us for even suggesting that they leave early.

Were we wrong to do this?"
656,cb3lxd,"AITA for being upset that my in-laws kicked my cat outside? Okay so here’s the situation, my husband and I are traveling and my mother in law (MIL) and father in law (FIL) are watching our cat at their house while we are gone. It’s a long trip so he has been with them for almost 3 months. We pay for everything he needs and missed him a lot. He is an indoor/outdoor cat, mostly indoor because he likes beds and comfy couches but he also likes to frolic outside in the grass too so he can go outside if he wants. 

While we were out of town my husbands sister (SIL) and brother in law (BIL) came into town for a visit. BIL is allergic to cats, I’m not sure of the severity. He has been to our house before and we have always had a cat but I haven’t seen him around them for long periods of time. So when they picked BIL and SIL up from the airport SIL basically said that the cat had to go or they wouldn’t stay. MIL and FIL have been watching our cat for 3 months now so it wasn’t a surprise that they had him. So since MIL and FIL really wanted to spend time with SIL and her daughter (MIL and FIL’s granddaughter) and SIL basically gave the last minute ultimatum they decided to lock the cat out of the house for the duration of their stay. 

Now, I understand BIL has an allergy, and allergies suck. But no one even called us to ask if the cat would be okay stuck outside for days at a time. We were perfectly reachable by phone but they just decided to put him outside and we found out when we came back and got a message to not let the cat inside and he has to stay outside. If we had known I could have gotten my dad to take the cat because he also lives in the same town. There is also other family that do not have cats that BIL and SIL could have arranged to stay with.

So, AITA for being pretty upset at my MIL and FIL for forcing my cat outside for almost a week? AITA for also being upset that SIL and BIL expected them to get rid of him to accommodate their visit?

Edit: I think I may have been unfair to my MIL and FIL here. They love our cat very much and take very good care of him. They were in a hard spot and I think made the wrong decision in not calling us. While he was outside my MIL checked on him and petted him everyday and made sure he stayed around. I think no one really thought the visit through enough until the last minute and I was upset that SIL and BIL were okay with them putting the cat out so they could visit. They are all really wonderful people and this is not going to be a relationship ender. MIL and FIL have now apologized for not calling us when this came up."
657,c7dti7,"AITA for telling a guy of because he accused me of being hypocritical about my sexual identity? I am 25 male in a relationship with a great guy been together for 7 years. Now I do not really relate to the popular gay culture. I do not enjoy things like cross-dressing, I am not feminine and do not wear what you call flamboyant outfits. But if being gay simply means a person who engages in sexual activities with people of the same sex, then I am gay.

Now my bf is the opposite of me. He enjoys cross-dressing once in a while and is a little feminine. But we love each other the way we are so no problems there. 
He also has this circle of close gay friends who love to hang out together like once a week. Last week was my bf's birthday and he decided to invite these friends over for a little celebration at our apartment. 

One of these friends, Jake (not his real name) has been living abroad for a few years and was back in town so I do not really know him. He is a very outspoken and somewhat cynical guy. When my bf introduced me to him, he started bombarding me with a lot of questions about every aspect of my sexuality, which kind of made me feel uncomfortable.

He then asked why he had never seen me before, and my bf, bless his heart, told him that was because I never went to gay bars or places where gay people love to hang out. He then asked me why I, a gay man, do not associate myself with other gay men, so I told him, first I just don't really like being labelled as to allow everyone to define what I am or am not. Second,  I prefer keeping my private life private. 

He then said ""There is no such thing as a gay man living his life like a straight man. If you're gay, you're gay. You can't just walk around and give people the impression that you're straight while you still have a dick in your mouth every night in your bedroom. You're just living a lie.""

That really rubbed me the wrong way because I sensed it that he was calling me a hypocrite. So I told him that what I am or choose to be is none of his business. My sexual preference is merely a part of my self-identity. And I am in control of it in accordance with how I live my life. Not the other way around. If having a dick in my mouth means I am gay,  then I am gay indeed. But not because I identify with what most people and some gay people think is appropriately gay.""

He wouldn't shut up about it and kept pestering me until I completely lost my shit and told him that if he is gay and proud then ""what are you doing in the house of a person like myself?""
He looked really offended and then left immediately. My bf thought I was being a little too harsh. Am I the Asshole?

EDIT : Now all of my bf's friends also think I am hypocritical based on their late night WA conversation, and I told bf that I don't give a shit about what they think but he said he gives a shit because it's between his good friends and me, the love of his life, and suggests that I be the bigger person and apologize for 'kicking him out'.  I, of course, said NO!

EDIT 2 : Thanks for one of you here who DMed me and accused me of posting a validation thread. This might sound like it is but believe me, a tiny itsy bitsy part of me is indeed feeling guilty because it was my bf's birthday and things were awkward after that one friend left, which completely ruined everyone's mood to celebrate more. So yeah I basically ruined my bf's birthday party.
Grammar.

EDIT 3 : Thanks to one of the commentators here who pointed it out to me that maybe bf's friends are just being jealous and upset that I somehow have influenced in him toning his gayness down a bit in recent years. He used to be more feminine and flamboyant but since we started dating I talked him into keeping it down a little. Not because I was ashamed of him, but because not everyone is as open as others when it comes to what is being perceived as 'normal'. I am from a small town where the people are so religious and not as accepting as those in bigger cities.

EDIT 4 : To everyone who does not understand. People here are crazily religious and homosexuality is not openly and widely accepted. Being gay means you are more prone to violence and denial of public privileges. I asked my bf to TONE IT DOWN for his own safety. I DID NOT force him to CHANGE HOW HE WAS. I love him and want to save him from harm and rejection because that's how it is living in this country as a gay person. And he understood my intention. He is openly gay and now knows better than to act 'all gay' in public places, which is my point actually.

EDIT 5 : To those who call me a homophobic gay guy it's okay. But at the end of the day I know and I get to decide what I am. Because I am the only one who understands me. My bf understood my well-meaning intention and is not making such a big fuss about it like some here. He knows exactly I love him and care about him. If he felt that I am forcing him to change himself or live a lie, or oppressing his freedom of expressing himself as a gay man, then he would have left me years ago.  We're still together and love each other and it's all that matters."

After five months I made the decision to let my best friend go from my band, he was the bassist. 

The way I did it probably didn't help. I gave him a ride to work, but didn't really find a way to tell it to him in the ride over. He was getting a little introspective in his life, but I knew if I didn't tell him sooner it would end up being worse. I waited until he got to his destination to tell him the news. I wanted to explain more but he had to go into work. 

Over the months I tried to encourage him to not only play our songs but just to play whatever he wanted so he can get back up to speed, never seemed to take the advice. Even when other band mates tried to encourage him. Sometimes he'd leave the bass for weeks on end at my house. I tried to be patient, I tried to be an asshole about it, I've already told him to step it up to only have it fall on deaf ears. I sound like a disgruntled parent trying to get his kid to go to soccer practice or some shit.

The next day he came over my house and we talked about it. I understood that someone getting kicked out of anything is a sore subject for anyone and would've given him some space regardless. I realized I would probably need some space from him as well. 

He tried to psych me out in saying that he had to cancel the two gigs as background musicians he had lined up for us. One at a comedy club, another at the Mohegan Sun Casino, all without sending demos apparently . I didn't say this to him, but I knew it was absolute bullshit (We are an alt rock band, I don't think they would be looking for people like us to play for those types of gigs). I had an exact situation in a previous band. He claimed he wanted to keep it as a surprise. Whether or not it is true, I appreciate him looking for gigs, but I only expected him to practice. We were supposed to play this Wednesday for the comedy club, as I am typing this out, we wouldn't be ready for it in such short notice anyway. He never shown proof either, but I didn't ask for it, I'll take responsibility for that. 

It turned out bittersweet for the both of us. I knew before hand in his tendency to be defensive and extremely cynical at times. Idk, I didn't mean to make it personal, but it seem he took it that way. I told him that I spent too long giving him chance after chance, and it was about time we found someone who took it serious.

We are working one night (I’m a server and he’s one of the front of house managers) and things are busy and I’m frustrated over the kitchen screwing up two orders for two separate tables. I’m explaining this to him and he says “I can’t help if they are all retarded!” And then walks away. This blew my mind but I had shit to do and it happened so fast that I didn’t have time to react. Fast forward in the night and I hear him talking with another server about the soda machine not working correctly and he says “yeah this machine is retarded. We can never get it to work right.” Finally I chimed in and said “Can you stop saying the word retarded like that? It’s offensive. It’s basically the same as if someone refers to something as “gay”. As a gay man do you appreciate that?” Then I walked away to go to a table.

Fast forward another couple hours and I’m cashing out for the night and he says to me that I had no business correcting him in front of other servers and that it’s no ones business if he is gay or not and that the two words are not the same and I was a jerk for saying so. I tried to explain that I wasn’t implying that the two words MEANT the same thing but that saying them in those contexts were equally offensive to different groups. He was hearing none of it.

They first started hanging out together in august, mostly at our house. Everyone knew they had a crush on each other and wanted to become official, but as it turns out one of my brothers friends had a crush on the same girl that now is my brothers gf. So before my brother and his gf became official he wanted to talk to that friend to straighten things out so there wouldn't be bad blood between them because of the girl. Once my brother told her that before they became an official couple he wanted to talk to that friend she went nuts and screamed at him accusing him of rejecting her, not liking her back etc.

Then she proceeded to make a scene in front of all of their friends and after my brothers best friend tried to console her she publicly kissed him in front of their friends without his consent.

At first my brother didn't want to talk to her again but about a month later they started hanging out again and have been -now officially- dating since.

My parents actually try to start liking her again and also i have been nothing but nice to her, especially because i feel extremely sorry for her. Her parents are divorced and she now lives with her dad, stepmom and her new half-brother and she doesn't seem like she's happy with her new side of the family.

Altough i have been making an effort to start liking her again, i said ""no"" when my brother bought up the idea of her coming to our anual family vacation. Our anual family vacation is always my parents, my brother and me.
A few days ago we were talking about where we are wanting to go on vacation this year and today my brother stated that he wants to bring his gf along with us.
My parents and i talked about this once my brother was out of the room. My parents seem hesitant about her going with us but they feel bad because of her home life and i said that i don't want her coming along because since i'm going to university i don't get to see my family often and can't spend quality time with all of them anymore. If my brothers gf tags along we would split up into two groups (brother+gf, parents+me) and wouldn't spend aus much time together.

Plus, they have been dating for only a month now and nobody knows whether they will still be together by summer.
I said that i don't want her to come along and my parents understand and are going to tell my brother that decision tomorrow.

664,evfsjs,"AITA for not letting the seat recline all the way? Ok so this was a couple of months ago but I want to get a definitive opinion. 

My sister (25) is doing a work-research thing in Europe, and for my (14f) school winter break me and my parents wanted to fly over and visit since my sister was going back home for a couple of weeks right after the break ended. Well, my parents couldn’t get the time off so they flew me to my sister. Nothing happened on the flight there, was a cool experience flying alone for the first time. It was a great vacation with my sister. 

When it was time to leave, me and my sister had economy class tickets in the back of the plane - everyone was cramped together. It’s an 8 hour flight, but we figured it would be fine. 

About an hour into the flight, the guy in front of my sis started to recline his seat back, and my sister let him until she realized that he was basically lying on her chest. She felt really uncomfortable so she asked him to move his seat back up in English. He answered in Spanish so my sister asked again in Spanish, and then he started telling her in English that the person in front of him had moved his seat back and he had no room so just let him be. My sister asked him again but he just ignored her, so she managed to wedge her knees in between the seat and push the seat up herself so she had enough room. The seat was still reclined back, just not so much that we could literally see the top of his head. 

I guess he didn’t like that, cause he told my sister to move and she refused unless he stopped reclining his seat. He asked if I was traveling with her and when she said yes he turned to the person sitting next to him (his daughter? Idk she looked a little older than me) and told her to recline her seat in Spanish. I already had my knees up cause it was more comfortable for me, but she reclined until she hit my knees and then kept trying to recline more. I didn’t talk to her, and my sister was pissed and didn’t want to curse at a teen so she kept quiet. 

We had bought our own food so we didn’t have to move for the food service, so we were blocking their seats from moving back the whole entire flight. Occasionally, I would feel the girl try to move her seat back again but I was watching marvel movies so I didn’t really care. 

When the plane landed the people in front of us rushed off the plane but as we were getting off the people in the row next to the guy and girl told us that we were assholes and should have just let them recline. I feel kind of bad that they weren’t comfortable but neither were we.

665,cas5j2,"WIBTA if I asked my sister to clean her damn room and not have sex in the guest room? In our house we have a guest room that is generally used as an office/lounge area. my sister would sleep in her room normally but because she's a huge slob her room is filled with stuff. a few weeks ago she tried cleaning it but it's now stuck in a cleaning purgatory with a mountain of stuff on her bed.

In the mean time she and her bf decided to take over the guest room for sleeping during the night. yeah. sure. fine. thing is I think she's having sex on the bed without taking the responsibility to clean it. I try to go in to grab something during the day but often she's half naked.

Also we have a cat who uses that room and every night my sister closes the door effectively locking the cat from her cat tree. 

Ultimately she has to clean her room but I just want to be able to go in the spare room and maybe take a nap on the bed if I want without fearing that I'm sleeping on day old spunk. 

WIBTA if I confronted her?"
666,aq53mg,"AITA for finding a clingy Friend annoying? Long backstory:   This girl and I knew each other from church, I grew up in this church and she was introduced to my church by her aunt in her preteens. When she first came in, she was much closer to this other girl and besides the weekly pleasantries exchanged we never went beyond acquaintances. Few years after, the other girl stopped coming and she started going around alone. I felt bad for her and so I started to include her in my group of friends.


The first few years were fine, but subsequently she started becoming very clingy towards me, showing me physical affection and literally latching onto me despite my very obvious shows of discomfort. For a year I tried my best to stay away from her, but felt bad again and opened up to her, letting her touch me and stuff.  

She hasn’t gotten baptised despite half her life in church, and I have no negative thoughts regarding that because I don’t want to come off as the staunch Christian who drives away people with religion. And since her parents don’t come to church, along with me being part of 95% of the conversations she has in church, it’s evident I’m the only person keeping her in church. She says she believes but when asked whether she wanted to get baptised she always avoided the question. But that’s not my point. 


We’re both adults now, I’ve known her for close to 10 years, we’re the same age so we experienced changing of schools and major events in the same period. I would think as adults she would be more thoughtful of others or more socially aware. It’s getting very frustrating, she only turns up for events I go for, otherwise she will never go. When she comes, she sticks to me and I cannot hold proper conversations with other people because she’s always butting in. I feel like an asshole because sometimes I just want her to leave my side for a minute or two, especially in a church context any negative words is almost blasphemous. 


AITA? I’ve tried talking to her about it but she didn’t really get my point. "
667,7i95ob,"AITA for not wanting to declaw my cats even though that was a condition on my friend taking them? I’ll try to make this short. My dad relocated for a year and found a woman to watch his two cats (both 12 years old). Unfortunately this woman died from the flu last week. So I’ve been very panicked trying to find another place for my cats to live until my dad returns in July. 

One of my mother’s friends offered to help. I dropped off the cats yesterday but she made it very clear that she wanted to declaw them as she has cats as well and is worried about their safety. Although my cats have never once attacked each other or any human, I understand the concern. 

I did some research today and called a few vets to book the appointment, and I hadn’t realized just how dangerous it is for older cats to go through this procedure. It can cause so many complications and is incredibly painful for old cats. I don’t want to go back on my word, but the thought of causing any permanent damage to my sweet fur babies is making me sick to my stomach. 

I should note that I asked just about everyone I knew if they could take in these cats and this woman is the only one to respond. I don’t know what to do if she won’t keep them. "
668,bvz8oo,"AITA For not letting my SIL see my son while she is in rehab for a month? This is a throwaway account.

**Background info:**

I (20F) have a son who is almost 1. My sister-in-law is about 24, and is currently in rehab for alcoholism. 

Before she went to rehab, she would disappear, for days at a time, binge-drinking. Then she would go to family events and church as if nothing was going on. The weekend before she went to rehab, the family had plans to get together for a kind of late Mother's Day lunch. Instead of showing up, my SIL went out the night before and got completely wasted and was really sick the day of the lunch. She's a petite woman, so she gets *really* sick. A few days later she agreed to go to rehab. 

At this rehab facility, she is not allowed contact for 7 days. After that, she can have phone calls whenever and visitors on Sundays for a short period. 

**The situation that makes me question whether IATA.**

The other day, my son and I went to lunch with my MIL and GMIL. During lunch, they both told me that I have to bring my son to visit my SIL in rehab, because we ""need to show that we support her"", and because she ""misses *son's name* terribly"". They said that my SIL has been telling the other girls at this facility about how cute *her baby* is, and I need to bring him so that she can show him off. They also told me not to worry, because the place is a huge mansion and super secure, and no one is even allowed to bring bags in. (I'm not sure why this is supposed to make me feel more comfortable with the situation? I cant bring a diaper bag into a place that we will be for about 3 hours, so that's inconvenient, but that's okay).

Anyway, I had a bad taste about the whole thing and just kept telling them that I would talk to my husband (their son/grandson). 

When I got home, I told my husband everything that was said, and I also expressed to him the following: 

I'm not comfortable bringing my son to a rehab facility, even if it is ""safe"". I also kind of feel like they are using my son as a ""reward"" for her being in rehab.. I dont know how to explain it, but that's how I feel. They said that she misses him, and that she wants to see him, but my thing is.. if she had not gone out binge drinking, she could have seen him. 

I'm proud of her for agreeing to go into rehab, but she has only been there for a little over a week or so. Why should I let her see my son? She can see him when she gets out. 

I also feel uncomfortable because they said that she wants to ""show"" ""her baby"" off. 

Anyway, my husband agreed with me and said that he will visit her alone. He told his family this and they think we are both assholes because we are ""withholding"" our son from my SIL and ""giving the impression that we don't support her"".

So, AITA? Or, I guess, AWTA?"
669,d6f1ee,"AITA for not paying friend back for wrong day tickets? Longtime lurker - finally joined cause I’ve got a situation..
A group of friends decided to attend a show on a certain date/time. Tickets were about $100/person. The guy organizing the event - let’s call him Jim - was buying all the tickets so he could make sure we all had seats together. The date was picked for a Friday night and Jim said he’d get the tickets. 

A couple weeks later, he emailed out the tickets and asked everyone to Venmo him the money. I look at the tickets and see he bought them for the following Friday, not the one we agreed upon. I told the group. The tickets were non refundable and we weren’t able to move them to the correct date. 

Everyone else was able to attend on the ‘wrong date’ still. My husband and I discussed and while we didn’t have actual plans for the Friday, it was our weekend with his daughter. We guard our time with her jealously because only seeing her every other weekend never feels like enough. We didn’t want to get a sitter and we consider having her as having plans. So we declined going to the show on the new date.

Jim said he would try to find someone to use our tickets - we looked as well but didn’t find any takers. The day after the show, Jim texted us asking for $200 for the tickets. His reasoning has that he took it upon himself to organize this outing and we agreed to go. Yes he made a mistake but since we trusted him with buying the tickets, he shouldn’t be stuck with the cost. Also, we didn’t have other plans so we should have just gone. 

I vehemently disagree. If you aren’t capable of buying tickets for the correct date, then you have no business organizing the outing. We never would have agreed to the date he bought the tickets for - he made the mistake so he should pay for it. I checked the original messages sent on the date and we all clearly agreed to a certain date. I don’t know how he got it wrong.

I’ve polled my friends on this and they mostly think I am TA since we could have gotten a sitter and gone. Plus $200 is a lot. 

For the record, we are considering paying anyways to salvage the friendship.. I just want to know if we are in the wrong. So AITA?"
670,cjm0a5,"AITA for yelling at a kid to pull her dog away from me. Hello before you judge please read the whole story. I’m on mobile sorry for the formatting and sorry for the spelling and grammar mistakes. 



OK so I’m taking my dog Toby on our last walk of the day to our local park. He likes to get in the grass and roll around and smell the flowers. So we’re walking up a hill to an area where there aren’t a lot of people  and a nice stretch of land full of grass and trees. I have my earphones on listening to music to pass  the time. In front of us I see a girl maybe 13 or 14  with a beautiful Husky coming my way. I stop and observe the situation and I noticed that the Husky is pulling her over to me and Toby. I cross over to the other side of the street/road  and  I make a motion to her telling her no to  not  come  my way. She didn’t stop  the dog, once she is close enough that I know she could hear me, I asked her to please pull her dog back and she doesn’t, she lets it get closer. 

       Now would be a great time to tell you that my little Toby is an old Shih Tzu  who is blind and is anxious around big dogs. Now back to the story apparently her parents saw what was going on and the mother yelled at me that her dog just wants to play, I kept pulling back trying to get as much distance between us but this girl just wouldn’t stop. The husky was jumping, pulling and want my Toby, so I ended up going into mamma bear mode and pulled Toby behind me, he was starting to act up  and walking in circles trying to figure out what was happening. I was standing with Toby behind me just in case anything happens, I was a shield for Toby. The girl was really close by this time maybe 5/6feet away and I had an angry look on my face and yes yelled “ Jesus Christ he’s blind could you please just leave us alone!!!!!”  The mom came running and pull back the dog and give us enough room to leave. 

        The girl was shocked, the parents both said  that they didn’t know he was blind, and I just said a quick “ sorry”  still pretty angry and walked out. I feel bad for yelling at the little girl, but I did everything I could think of. I crosses  the road I told her to please stop and she didn’t, in the end I just yelled at her trying to get my message across. 

     Honestly I was just thinking of my dog, I know how anxious and aggressive he could get around big dogs. I didn’t want shit to hit the fan Toby would have bitten this dog, the parents would’ve been angry maybe call the cops on me, and filed some kind of order telling me to put him down for being aggressive.  Honestly I have spent so much time,  love and money on my little pain in the ass to have him become a chicken nuggets to some other dog or have some people tell me to put him down because they wouldn’t listen to me. 


So AITA for yelling at the girl to get  her dog away from me? 
Could I have done something else?"
671,doyi6h,"AITA for kicking a guy out of our group and probably causing him to fail the semester? I’ll try to keep this vague to avoid identification but here’s the thing. At the end of the semester we have a huge group protect that consists of smaller projects helmed by each individual with the rest of the group assisting and rotating roles. 

There was this guy, younger, good natured, fun, but he didn’t take his or anyone’s project seriously, which caused him to underperform and us having to sacrifice our own projects for his sake. He did the least he could get away with and often didn’t do anything at all. I guess he saw my role as his “supervisor” and left me in charge of everything, he didn’t show up to meetings, or left as soon as possible, refused to provide me with necessary documents, constantly forgot when and what we were working on, even his own project, avoided responsibilities to party and get drunk, complained when things didn’t go his way and blamed me despite being unclear in what he needed and when. 

Things reached a boiling point last week as he first didn’t show up to an important group meeting and essentially told us to do his job for him, and then disappeared to a massive party over the weekend and forgot we had to work on his project that Monday. He got incredibly pissed I ended up taking the reins and calling the shots, worried about my and my classmates performance, and that I didn’t tell him anything, which I did. He just didn’t communicate with us for a whole weekend. 

 After talking with the higher ups at our college we decided to “kick” him out and keep working without him, he had also talked to them to complain about us and wanting to work alone.  

This guy will almost guaranteed fail this semester without us, and I feel partially responsible since I’m older than him, and I was meant to supervise him, not to mention the toll of failing the semester. On the other hand, this is college, and doing things for him so he can pass without learning anything will bite him in the ass sooner than later. 

I feel torn and guilty AF, so AITA? 

TL;DR: Kicked an irresponsible and lazy college classmate from our final project, possibly causing him to fail."
672,bf5m55,"AITA for getting angry with how messy my parents keep the house? I'm a 19 year old university student who occasionally comes home to visit his parents and stays over the summer. And they have a fundamental inability to keep their house even presentable. There are frequently dirty pots and pans overflowing in the sick, all over the counters and on the stove, occasionally even on the tables. At any given moment around ~40-50% of the food in the fridge is spoiled/questionable, the basement is literally unusable because of how much random shit is in it, the living room usually has clothes tossed all over it and the bedrooms of the house (excluding mine) also have shit everywhere. However, my parents also make me and my brother do massive clean up campaigns often out of the blue to make the house ""clean"" whenever family or friends come over. Although now that I'm only back for part of the year, I'm not expected anymore

Whenever my mother does do any actual cleaning, she goes on tangents about how she does everything in the house (no she doesn't) and how her husband and kids are useless. Yet, she still often tells us we're expected to keep the house clean. My dad will do the bare minimum if repeatedly asked, but he won't clean up after himself and will leave food out or improperly covered till it spoils. 

I have repeatedly asked my parents to try and clean up after themselves better, but they have always either dodged the conversation or turned accusative. Personally, whenever I cook anything, even if it's for the family, I clean it. If I make a mess anywhere in the house then I clean it. And I do occasionally clean the washrooms. 

This has often led to me getting into heated arguments with my parents, usually my mother, over the obligation to keep the house clean. My mother refuses to do a reasonable share of the burden, keeps way more stuff than we realistically need (she has nearly 40 pairs of shoes and 10 bottles of shampoo) and never cleans up when she cooks, but yet she insists she cleans the house AND claims she should never have to. I believe that when you make a mess in the house you should clean it up in 99% of circumstances and that she shouldn't keep so much unnecessary shit, but she always insists that the house could be kept clean if everyone else did their share (me and my brother do). 

My dad on the other hand just simply can't be bothered. He doesn't actively keep stuff he doesn't need, but he never really cleans up after himself or half-asses it when he does. 

The messiness of the house has had a legitimately detrimental impact upon my mental health when I lived here full time and when I come visit. My parents expect me to occasionally stop by and stay for the summers (not that I can afford to move out anyways), but I hate doing so because of the state of the house. 

AITA for expecting everything to be clean to a basic standard and for not wanting to stay at the house in its current state?"
673,bc2c50,"WIBTA for asking my mom to stop tracking my location? does this need a td;lr? i’ll put a td;lr. 

*td;lr* my mother and i turned on my location tracking services my freshman year of college for safety. i’m now about to graduate and move in with my boyfriend and feel like i’m being monitored for fun more than safety. i want to ask her to turn off my location services after i move in with said boyfriend.

background: i (21f) am the first child, currently finished up my first semester of my last year in college, and live about 5 hours away from the rest of the family. i have a younger brother (15m) who still lives with my mother (40sf).

context: my freshman year of college i *willingly* turned on my location services for my mother to track my location because i was nervous about living so far away, with no car, and no friends. for the first two years, it was just there as a safety thing. the past year and a half, my mother has taken to checking in on me more often; asking me why i’m out so late/who i’m with/why i’m where i am. 
for example: i met my current boyfriend about 6 months ago and started spending the night at his place. my mom called me around 3am one morning ranting about why i wasn’t at my university. 
anyway - i am getting close to graduating and moving in with said boyfriend, i now have a car, am working on a job, and trying to transition into “adult life”, and feel as if i might transition a bit easier if i didn’t feel like i was being monitored all the time. 

i guess i do understand why she would want to have it on, and it doesn’t exactly hinder my daily life, but after asking her if she would do the same to my bother when he leaves for college and receiving a resounding no - it makes me feel a little claustrophobic. 

so, dear reddit, WIBTA for asking my mother to stop monitoring my location?

674,b0lokv,"AITA for not wanting Snapchats from my friend after she had sex? So I'm a guy and she's at uni, I'm on my gap year. Recently she started seeing a guy and keeps making it painfully obvious that he's ""the Irish version of me"". I thought, great, that's fine none of my business and I'm glad she's moving on. We had a small on and off thing in school a few years back but still managed to stay friends after. 

Anyway, recently she keeps sending me Snapchats at ungodly hours of them both in bed clearly naked (under the covers) after what I'd assume was them having sex. The sends wierd messages with them like ""this guy woke me up at 2am!"" or just one word messages like ""hi"" or ""happy"". Mind you this is usually out of the blue and we haven't been talking for at least 6 or 7 hours or even a couple days. 

To me it seems like she's trying to purposefully show off that she's having sex with this guy, I don't really care I just think it's weird to send that sort of thing to anyone. So I confronted her, told her I don't like it and it makes me uncomfortable and now she's mad at me saying I should be a better friend. AITA? 

UPDATE: She's currently ignoring me (after opening my messages), man do I feel like a 14 year old again hahah. I'll see if she ever talks to me again and give another update...

EDIT: There seems to be a few things I need to clear up, obligatory sorry for the upcoming (and possibly previous) formatting, I'm on mobile. 

There was no actual nudity, Just them under the covers clearly naked every time, sometimes sweaty but always in bed clearly naked. 

I'm bi but I've never came out to her and even if she did find out from someone else I've never been the GBF type, I pride myself with being a butch kind of gay (no offence to anyone else, just my preference). But I don't think this is relevant becuase I wouldn't send pics of me with a girl to my male friends, it's still wierd. She knows I feel uncomfortable talking about sex with my female friends, I know it seems immature but I just don't like it.

The guy participates in the pics, arm round her and all that so he either doesn't know who the pics are going to or doesn't know the relationship history. Feel bad for the guy. 

And finally, she thinks I should be happy for her and there's nothing wrong with sending those pics (although not lude, private) so I shouldn't be upset/uncomfortable.

I think that's it, have a good day reddit! "
675,dl6ghn,"AITA for distancing myself from a friend because I can't accept how she's handling a situation? To make a long story short, I used to be part of a group of 5 friends. Last year, I had a disagreement with one of them, and the other three took her side (aka, her and my three friends against me). They did not blatantly take her side and say I did anything wrong, but they would prioritize her feelings (she's more sensitive than I am) over mine and tiptoe around me.

Over a few months, I started to distance myself from this group because I couldn't handle how they were treating me (lying to me about plans, not inviting me in the first place, talking poorly about me, etc). I didn't make a scene - I just started spending less time in their circle and made my own plans. No matter how many times I sat down to clear things with the girl that was upset with me, things were just not the same after.

Now the hard part: I was best friends with one of these girls prior to this circle forming. She's sweet and means well, but she's definitely picked the other girl over me in terms of how she arranges plans. For instance, I've asked to hang out one-on-one a few times, but it overlaps with when the other girls are in town, so she tells me it's best to avoid the drama of running into them, and tells me she'll plan another time to hangout with me. And then doesn't.

She's also a people-pleaser, so she will tell me it's messed up how they treat me, but she then continues to play a role in it by choosing other plans with them over me - for the other girl's sake. 

I understand she's in a hard spot trying to be friends with me AND the group, and I'm not asking her to choose, but I feel like I can't hang on to this friendship anymore. It feels so fake and as though there's a huge elephant in the room (I mean... there is), and it's hurtful to see them all go on to be great friends despite how I was mistreated. I know it's also tricky when it's essentially 1 v 4. 

I am a very upfront person and have a hard time putting on a face, but it feels very inappropriate to talk poorly of the other girls with this friend (or even mention them at all, or that I feel hurt), given their relationship. I just cannot separate this girl from those girls at this point. It became hurtful enough that I muted them on all social media so I don't have to see their posts together anymore. (Which is also how I used to find out I was left out of plans - I'd see it on Instagram of all places)

I know my distance is hurting my friend, but she doesn't feel like someone I can be honest and comfortable with anymore.

Here's how I see it: It's unfair to expect her to not be friends with them. However, I am emotionally conflicted and feel betrayed knowing they talk poorly of me and she continues to prioritize them in group situations. I also cannot confide in her anymore.

Are we both assholes? Am I expecting too much of this friend and should mature enough to not care about how she spends her time? Is she an asshole? Am I overthinking this, and this is normal/part of getting older? Help.

AITA if I let this friendship go?"
676,bu7ui9,"AITA for telling my childfree sister to stop commenting on my parenting? New poster, long time lurker, abysmal at grammar, sorry for any errors. 

This is basically exactly what the title says. My twin sister is childfree. And I don't just mean in the ""doesn't have kids, doesn't want them"" kind of way. I mean in the ""actively hates children, uniromically refers to parents as ""breeders"" with a tone of disgust"" kind of way.  I honestly don't know *why* she hates kids so much, but she does and that's her prerogative. I'm the polar opposite. I think kids are awesome and I have a daughter of my own who is 6. I'm split up from her mother, but we're still very good friends and co parent very amicably.  

My sister has nothing to do with my daughter. She will talk to her at family events if other people are around, but will not see her alone. It's to the point where she'll only come visit me if my daughter is a) at her mum's or b) in bed, so she doesn't have to be around her. Again, this is her prerogative and it seemingly works for her, so whatever. However, the issue lies in the fact that, even though she has nothing to do with my kid herself, she seems to feel she's entitled to comment on my parenting. Some examples of this; I still let my daughter sleep in my bed if she's feeling sick or has a nightmare, and my sister says this is bad parenting and will stunt her emotionally; I got my daughter a tablet for Christmas last year and generally let her sit and play with it for an hour or two a day while I do housework or uni coursework or whatever, sister says I'm rotting her brain; I asked our mum to babysit overnight so I could go to a friend's birthday do a couple of weeks ago, sister called me an irresponsible and reckless parent. The latter was what broke the camel's back, and I snapped at her, telling her since she has an aversion to children she can't comment on my parenting. (Edit: just wanna say this is not by any means a comprehensive list but I'm conscious of character limit, so pulled a few examples. Can go more in depth with this in comments if you like). 

She got pretty outraged at that and told me that I'm being disrespectful and that, just because she doesn't have kids, doesn't mean she's an idiot and doesn't know basic things. She ended up in tears because she felt like I was insulting her intelligence. That wasn't my intention, of course, I'm just fed up with her simultaneously hating my child and also trying to tell me how to raise her. However, I accept I might have overstepped some line and pulled a dick move here. AITA or is it okay I said that?"
677,evq5b4,"AITA For getting a family kicked off a ride after waiting in line?  This story took place over my all-too-short vacation this past week. At universal studios Orlando they have a decent harry potter roller-coaster. This ride wait time is listed as a 50 minute wait and is usually about half that time for fast-past users. Keep in mind a fast pass for a single rider is $140 extra before taxes.

When you get in line they scan your fast pass on this particular ride, then you wait in line with all the other fast-passers and get to enjoy the ride. Well, on our way into the back of the line (after the initial scan), there is a family (father/ mother/ teenage daughter/ and young son) and they cut under the rope that split fast pass users and the returning masses. This family ends up right in front of us and we say something along the lines of ""that's not how this all works"" and honestly we just went around them because fuck that. I could tell straight away they probably didn't have passes because A. they cut under the rope, and B. you could tell one parent wasn't entirely sure about cutting under to which the teen must have reassured them (different language so I don't know what they said). It should be mentioned that the teen daughter sneered at us and could tell she didn't appreciate us chiming in.

As we are waiting for this line me and the SO are kind of discussing this and although them cutting didn't effect us at all, because we passed them up, it didn't sit right with us that they would get the same treatment as everyone else behind them even though they all paid so much extra per ticket. So after discussing it we decided that we would tell a staff member when we next see one.

After waiting a good 25 minutes the line is informed that one of the two carts is down so it will essentially take a lot longer to move through the ranks of people waiting.

In the end it takes about the full 50 minutes to get to the front. I inform the attendant of what happened and he was more than happy to 'double check our fast passes' and the next few riders as he understood the situation. At the end of the day this family waited the entire 50+ minutes and were booted off the ride without getting to enjoy it (presumably again). Normally I would not think I suck at all but I just haven't been able to shake feeling a bit bad for the youngest boy who was just following his parents direction and had to wait around for nearly an hour to not even get to ride.

So, am I the asshole for getting a family kicked off for cutting into fast-pass lane literally right before getting on the ride after waiting almost an hour?"
678,ds3lot,"AITA for following orders while babysitting someone my age. Hello! Long time viewer here! Throwaway for obvious reasons. Posted on mobile, so sorry for any errors.

I (14M) am in 8th grade, and David (13M) is in my grade. We share a lot of classes, but have never gotten to know each other. I have been doing babysitting for quite a while now. I started doing it for extra money, because the only thing I have to do is watch over some child, and I can do my homework while babysitting. One of my clients, on Sunday, asked me if I could babysit their neighbor’s kid from 6 to 10PM. I didn’t know who I was babysitting, but I agreed to do it.

I got to their home, and to my shock, I found out that I was babysitting David. His parents seemed very strange. (Why would someone need to hire a babysitter for a 13 year old??) They gave me a schedule of everything that David was supposed to do, and I was supposed to enforce it. From 6 to 8, he had to do his homework, from 8 to 9, I had to open up a safe with a combination his parents gave me, give David his phone, and watch over him to make sure he doesn’t do anything inappropriate on it. If he decided to go to the bathroom, I had to ask to take his phone. At 9, I had to take his phone, put it back in the safe, and make him read a book. At 10PM, his parents would return. I had to make sure that he didn’t curse at all, and if he did, I should report it to his parents.

I know that his parents seem very controlling, however I am just a babysitter, so I decided to follow the rules. I already did my homework, so I just read Reddit while he did his homework. He asked multiple times, to give him his phone or the passcode for the safe. I refused to do that. He started complaining that I was his classmate, and that I am an asshole for treating him like a kid.  I reminded him that he wasn’t allowed to curse. I also refrained from cursing. At 8, I opened up the safe, and gave him his phone. I followed him, and told him that I had to look at his screen. He said F*** you. At around 8:45 he tried to run to the bathroom, but I told him to give me his phone. He did that, and got pissed as ever. He spent a while in the bathroom, and at 9 I put his phone back in the safe. He came out like 5 minutes later and yelled at me, because I took his phone. I gave him his book, and reminded him that he had to read it. Finally, his parents returned.

They asked me if he did anything bad, and I said that he said F*** you to me, and called me an asshole. They thanked me, gave me the money, and I left. The next day, he looked extremely pissed at school, and his friend called me a dick, among other things.

Not sure if I am the asshole here. From my point of view, I just followed orders. I don’t hate David, I just want my money. Now, it is your time to decide if I am an asshole, or if I am not an asshole.

Edit: thanks a lot for the great feedback! I saw both points of view. Just to clarify a few things: I didn’t know that I was going to babysit him, until I was in his house and talking to his parents. Also, David is only 2 months younger than me. His original babysitter couldn’t come, so his parents asked the neighbor for a babysitter, who asked me. They asked me that around 30 minutes before I was supposed to start. Also, they paid me a lot more than my usual rate, because I am 14 while their original babysitter was an adult, and they gave me the adult’s rate.

679,coij2h,"WIBTA if I put my neighbour's dog up for adoption? Ok, so a little context first. I live in a neighbourhood where we all get along very well. We live under certain rules we all agreed to and which we inform immediately to new neighbours. We even have a group chat to share relevant info about our town and neighbourhood as well.

One of the main rules is that dogs are not allowed on the street (not house dogs, not street dogs). Here in Argentina we have a problem with dogs on the street, there are too many and they can be dangerous for people who are walking nearby (especially children). So, everytime we see a dog on the street, we send a picture to the group so the owner (if it has one) can go get it. In case the dog doesn't have a owner and is ""wild"" we try to find it a home. Dog's owners usually say the dog has escaped, that they are sorry and the dog doesn't show up on the street again.

So here's the thing, there's a lovely dog (girl) who is ALWAYS on the street. She is so cute and sweet and won't do any harm. The owner has been contacted numerous times (he is in the group chat) and he always replies with a ""oh she espaped again, sorry, will get her when I get home"". Let's say this is in the morning. At night the dog is still on the street. I am not worried about the dog harming anyone in this case, I'm worried about her. Her hair looks shitty, she looks hungry and she sleeps outside (on the street) almost every night. I live in the south of Argentina, so the temperatures can get very low at night at this time of the year.

Since the owner doesn't seem to care about this dog at all, my boyfriend and I have been wondering if we should put her up for adoption so she can be with a family who cares about her and doesn't abandon her all day everyday. We can't have her since our backyard is small and we already have a labrador. We feel so sorry for this dog, she is a red husky (for what I know about this breed, they need space to run around and be ""free"").

WIBTA if I found her a new home? I know that it's not my dog and that perhaps this is not my choice to make. I feel very hesitant about doing this but the truth is that I don't want to see a dog suffering, being hungry, dirty, alone and cold. I think all animals deserve love and a warm home. Her owner clearly doesn't give a single fuck about her or her well-being. Of course we thought that we should give a warning in the group before doing anything and if he doesn't act on it then we would get the adoption thing started.

So, what do you think?

&#x200B;

INFO: There are no dog shelters where I live. There is a dog pound which is way worse than the street itself. They keep the dogs on a big cold shed, barely feed them and kill them eventually if they don't get someone who wants to adopt. Some neighbours have already said that if they keep seeing the dog on the street they will call the pound to get her (obviously the owner hasn't said anything about this). This is why I am thinking on doing the adoption thing."
680,dmlw0i,"AITA for not letting my friend know I wasn't treating her to lunch? Hey guys,


So I have a good mom friend that I go out with fairly often with our kids. We usually get lunch and take them somewhere they can run around, like to a park or play place or something. Most of the time, I go ahead and treat since I usually am the one to ask her out and feel like it's polite to do. I'd say about 70% of the time I pay for us all.


Well my workplace has been cutting hours, so I don't really have the money for 5 people every time we go out, so I haven't really been paying for us all lately, and most of the time just me and my daughter. 


Well I asked if she'd like to take the kids for lunch and grab a coffee today, which she accepted. I didn't think to tell her I wasn't treating since I don't treat every time. When they came to ask if we were ready for the bill and asked if it was together or separate, I said separate. When the waitress walked away, she said ""oh. I figured you were paying, that's why I said sure. I didn't really want to have to pay for lunch today."" 


I told her sorry but I couldn't afford it this time, and she didn't say anything, but after we got home she sent me a text saying if I wasn't planning on paying, I shouldn't of bothered asking her out, or I should of at least given her a heads up that I wasn't treating, and that I put her on the spot and made her have to spend money she wasn't supposed to be spending. I apologized again and said I didn't think to specify, but she said if you invite someone out you should know to let them know if you're not planning on treating, because normally that's what it means when you're inviting someone out. She seemed pretty pissed off at me, and I'm not sure if she's going to be as willing to go out anymore. AITA?"
681,am0049,"AITA for wanting a birthday to myself? I have had one birthday party in my life. I've wanted to have a celebration for my birthday for several years now, but I have a friend whose birthday is just a few days after mine, and he always has a party on the weekend before our birthdays. 

A couple years ago, he suggested that we have a double party, and I accepted, but by the time the month of our birthdays came around he had forgotten and had made plans that didn't include me. The next year, I was going to hold my own party and announce it first, but he announced his party six months in advance. 

It wouldn't be as much of a problem if we didn't have so many mutual friends, but most of my friends are his as well, and don't want to go to two different birthday parties on the same weekend or a week apart.

(He hasn’t cheated on me) Last night I told him that I’m afraid to get tested because he might’ve given me something. He got mad and hasn’t spoken to me. Was I an asshole for saying that?

He got mad and turned around to sleep before I explained to him why. I’ve tried to apologize. However he keeps giving me a cold shoulder. I didn’t mean it to be disrespectful.

683,bvc3h1,"AITA for not wanting to be woken up in the middle of the night to cuddle? AITA - I'm an insomniac and I live with my boyfriend who I've been with for 3 yrs who wakes me up every single night in the middle of the night because he's a cuddler. I'm the kind of person who takes forever to get to sleep, let alone with someone wrapped around me and if I wake up in the night to pee or for any other reason it can take me hours to get back to sleep.

When I go to bed at night I take liquid melatonin which really helps to get me to sleep but not to keep me asleep. I put an eye mask on to block out any light and earphones in which all helps. He literally falls asleep in 15 seconds no matter what. It's really hard to get sleeping pills here from my Dr. And I don't really want them because then you get to a point where you just can't sleep without them which has happened to me in the past.

It's caused a lot of arguments between us. When I get annoyed about it during the night because he's woken me up by putting his arms and legs over me, he starts yelling at me. Telling me that I'm selfish and being a princess. I feel like he just doesn't get it because he sleeps so easily. Then he complains because apparently I'm always complaining that I'm tired. But the reason I'm always tired is him. I like cuddling etc too but when it's time to sleep my attitude is like... Please don't touch me again till my alarm goes off because I'm just awake then for hours. I have to be awake every morning during the week for work at 5 am. 

It's currently 4am as I write this and this exact thing just happened. He's already snoring. 1 minute ago he was yelling at me that I'm a selfish prick because I didn't want to cuddle because he woke me up again. Am I being princess for wanting a solid 7 hr sleep at night? I feel like this is a problem reserved for people with young kids who keep them awake.  I don't want it to seem like I don't love him or love being in bed and cuddling etc but I just want to reserve it for when we are awake before we go to sleep and in the morning during that Snooze time before you get up. 

Am I being a selfish princess?"
684,d8pvd1,"AITA for being annoyed with my roommate This is my second year living with two other students at my school. For the last year, we've mostly got on well. Mostly because I've ignored how one roommate, Kara uses her phone on speakerphone in common spaces, refuses to clean common spaces and refuses to take out trash/recycling. She comes in at 11pm and talks on speaker phone, without concern for whoever might be trying to sleep. Also, Kara's parents have picked her up multiple times at 4 am from our house, at which time they did not try to keep their voices down or shut doors/cupboards quietly. I have never mentioned anything, because I figured it was more important to keep the peace among us. 

This morning, I left the house at 9 am and locked the front door before shutting it behind me. I did not slam the door; additionally, I have shut the door the same way for the entirety of the last year at all times of day without complaints from anyone, including Kara. Kara later left a note on the front door telling all of us to shut the door behind us first quietly then lock it. She did not ask, or use the word ""please."" AITA for being annoyed by this? I understand if it was at 6 am, but I feel like 9 am is a time at which an acceptable amount of noise should be tolerated. Especially considering how much I have tolerated her in the past. Also, my other roommate does not care about the noise of the door shutting at all."
685,9s99k6,"AITA: For not giving the homeless written off hot food? Aita? I work at 7/11 and deal with a lot of drunk assholes, robberies, and homeless people. Yeah not all homeless people are fuck ups but this job sure makes it seem like they all are. We have a no loitering policy and encourage customers NOT to give food money etc to the homeless people. I've gone out of my way to city hall to get the homeless removed because I'm tired of getting piss thrown at me, cursed out, assaulted, and life threatened. Of course they're still here. 

Anyways, this homeless couple came in and wondered if I could double cut their pizza. So i did and gave it to them. 5 minutes later they're back saying they want it cooked more. I tell them i can only cook it to what I'm suppose to or I'll ruin it. They refuse to leave o I take a 16 slice pizza out of the box and cook it for 20 seconds and what do you know, I couldnt get half of the pizza out because it was burning onto the stone. 

I manage to get it out after some work and give it back to them. The lady asked if she could have a cup of ice and if I'll charge her. In my mind well they're homeless I'll save them money and say no. She grabs the biggest cup fills it a quarter way walks out 30 seconds later back in she yelling refill. Well shot myself in the foot should a charged her ok shame on me. Instead of her paying 2.18 she paid 99. 

The guy in the meantime is in a way pressuring me to give him the hot food I'm suppose to throw away. I tell him no countless times and here are my reasons why:
>if the homeless gets sick from the food we gave them (even pretend to be sick and it couldn't have even been from our food) they will sue probably lose anyways but waste company's money probably costing me my Job
>they will never leave if people keep giving them food which means more of the stuff I listed above will keep happening.

This time I have a job interview set up for today for a new job that I'd love to work for, if I got it I would immediately quit my current job.

She is from Illinois and she racked up some charges for retail fraud and malicious destruction of property and a couple other things.

689,ebaub2,"WIBTA if I didn't let my girlfriends mum store things in my freezer? Hi guys. Just a bit of background on the situation. My girlfriend and I have been together around 3 years,living together for about 8 months. We initially were living at her parents place, however they split up recently and sold their house. We were intending on moving out into our own flat, however her mum asked if we could move in with her, so we could help cover costs/allow her to rent a nicer place.

We agreed, as we ended up paying renting an area of the house as opposed to going out on our own. We also ended up pretty much fully independent to her as we have our own level with a kitchen, bathroom, washing machine etc. As a result, my girlfriend and I have remained independent, starting to buy our own appliances/utensils etc while we can afford it so when it comes time to move out, we should have minimal furnishing costs.

Recently I purchased a chest freezer for my food as I do alot of fishing/hunting which results in alot of meat for me to store. I explained when I bought it that is was door mine and my girlfriends food, and we would prefer not to stor anything else in there unless it was really necessary. It currently has a bit of meat and about 13kg of curly fries (don't ask why) but isn't anywhere near full as its summer where I'm from and I'm off hunting/fishing alot in the coming months. Today when I got home, there was a bulk amount of dog food and prawn cutlets stacked in our freezer.

690,azmbrk,"AITA for firing my personal trainer because he wanted me to eat better? About a year ago, I was in an accident and was injured. After working with a physical therapist for a number of months, I was discharged. In addition to continuing to do my physical therapy exercises on my own, it was suggested to me that I also start strength training. Since I don’t have any experience strength training and don’t want to injure myself any further, I decided to hire a personal trainer.

I had consultations with a couple trainers and picked the one that I liked best. I explained to him that my physical therapist suggested that I hire a personal trainer so I can gain overall strength, especially around the area of my injury. At the beginning of our first session, he got my weight and determined my body fat percentage. That evening, he sent me homework to do at home and a nutrition plan (the same one that he sends to all of his clients).

During our sessions, he would ask me what I had eaten that day, what I was eating for dinner, etc. I would tell him and he would critique my food choices. I would tell him that I am not concerned about that at the moment and just want to get to where I was before the accident.

He would back off for a bit and then it would start again: “You should make better food choices. You’ll feel a lot better if we get your body fat down.” Again, I explained that I wasn’t here to lose weight, body fat, learn about nutrition, etc. and again, he backed off. After six months of this, I fired him. 

I know that many people hire personal trainers because they want to lose weight. I know that tracking weight and body fat is a good measurement of success but that isn’t my focus. For the record, I started at a BMI of 21.5 and a body fat percentage of 28%. He was only concerned about my body fat, not my weight. Someone else I talked to about this said that I am a walking advertisement for him. If I don’t look good, he doesn’t look good.

Was I wrong for firing my trainer for wanting me to eat better?

My girlfriend and her roommate really wanted to go. They aren't the wealthiest though so I offered my apartment for them to stay in. I understand that they didn't want me hanging around because sometimes it's nice to just be with your friends. So I stayed at a friends house for 4 days while they stayed at mine. It seems kinda stupid to me that I was willing to completely give up my apartment for her and my girlfriend but she doesn't even want me to stay for 2 nights with my girlfriend.

He has a problems with both and has since denied it . He got in 5 car accidents 1 of them we know for sure that he was drunk driving because the morning after my mom went outside and saw the front of the car destroyed and he didn't wake up when my mom tried to do so so much that she got tired and called me and my dad to go check on him in the after noon and was still a little under the influence when we went.The 4 others don't know for sure but would not be surprised if he was under the influence.He never paid for the 5 cars my mom did.Each car would end full of drug that starting it would make a draft of the drugs smell and my little sisters wouldn't want to get inside.

The problem? My host mother tells everybody, I mean everybody, everything. She also puts everything on her Instagram story. We will call her Maria for now. 

When I joined rotary, I put my mental illnesses in my medical form, just in case anything happens. It’s suppose to be just between my host parents, and my country officer. Maria one day randomly asks me about this. I trust her, and explain to her what the effects are, what to do if something happens, and how I have what I have. I don’t like to think my mental illnesses are who I am, but I have no problem accepting that and working through them to have an easier life. 

After a few days, we are having a get together with Maria’s friends. They have brought some other people as well and there’s quite a good crowd. I brought Maria and her friends some drinks and Maria introduced me to the people I haven’t met. She then continues on saying where I’m from, and out of nowhere she states ALL of things I told her about my mental illnesses. 

I wouldn’t say I’m ashamed of them, but that was a PRIVATE moment for us. I felt so embarrassed and awkward when everyone went quiet and had worried expressions on their faces. I went outside to take a breather. It was all too much.

Later after it the party was over, O tried explaining to Maria that it was inappropriate to say those things, and that it was said in confidence. She then says (in Portuguese of course) “don’t you think people should know?” I tried seeing that logic, but people I barely know, know about my illnesses before they even know my last name. That reason wasn’t good enough for me.

There was even a time she told others I had a panick attack. I asked her why she felt the need to tell people I don’t know that, but she said “they need to get to know you!”

So lately I haven’t opened up to her. She still talks about me, not as extreme as the examples above, but still. Telling people about my family and my childhood I opened up to her about. It’s not the greatest. 

I fee like I can’t trust her. She repeats everything like a parrot. I can’t even tell her I am having menstrual cramps without her broadcasting it to everyone at the dinner table. Am I wrong for not opening up to her anymore?

694,enwia3,"AITA for shutting my sister down about diet advice? So a few days ago I started dieting to get ready for my wedding later this year.  Losing weight is really hard for me, because I have Insulin Resistant PCOS, and I went and got my doctor’s advice on how to do it properly so I wouldn’t put my health at risk. He said that I just needed to break my meals up throughout the day (eating anywhere from 6-8 small meals a day), and make sure I maintained a moderate level carb intake. Translation: No Keto Dieting.

Which brings in my sister.

She’s a very big advocate for keto dieting. She swears by it and feels it would definitely help me, but when I explained what my doctor said, she said that he was an idiot, that she had heard many complaints about him, that she had done tons of research, and that I should definitely do keto dieting because her doctor recommended it for women with PCOS.

I snapped at her and told her that she sounded like an anti-vaxx idiot and that when she got a doctorate and knew my condition as well as my doctor did, I would take her advice. She replied that with the amount of research she did, she basically was an expert.

I feel somewhat bad for shutting her down the way I did, but was it the wrong thing to do? AITA?"

Anyway onto what happened. So another thing is my mom doesn’t care if we drink or smoke (I should note when I say we I mean all my siblings even though I’m the youngest one and the only one at home). But I don’t really smoke weed because I don’t really care for it. And I never get drunk or even tipsy because I don’t like being out of control of my body. I have a fear of drugs and alcohol because my dad was and may still be (not sure don’t talk to him) a massive addict to both so if I drink it’s always one drink and then I’m done. But the thing is I hate beer. I don’t get the hype if it. It’s honestly so gross to me. 

Well my mom went and got a pack of beer and was like “I want you to try this”. I said no I’m good. I don’t like beer and I drink rarely because of my fear. She kept pushing and every time I said no and that I was uncomfortable and didn’t like beer. She still kept pushing until I couldn’t take it anymore and just snapped I said “I said fucking no that means no. You need to stop now” and she just was like “whatever” and got upset with me.

So fast forward and my sister falls pregnant and since I just had a baby of my own I keep helping her with this and that but during her pregnancy she has to stop taking her meds. Slowly, slowly her old self came back. When she had her baby she had a lot of troubles. I kept pushing for her to start therapy and take meds again (she wasn't breast feeding as she found it too demanding). It took 6 months but she finally did. 

My mother agreed to take care of her baby during her appointment but after my Mother agreed my sister pushed for more time to herself to go drink with her friends, which my mother agreed too because she is a sweet woman. On the day of my sisters appointment I had playgroup with my baby (a year older than my sisters) and during this playgroup I took a fall and partially tore the 3 major ligaments in my ankle. I called an ambulance and for legal reason they wouldn't allow my son to ride with us. My Hubby was already on his way but works quite far away so I called my Mother to ask if she could come grab my son and take him to the hospital to meet with my husband. 

So she takes my sisters baby comes grabs my baby drops him off to hubby and goes home. Unknown to me she called my sister and explained the situation asked if she could get her baby incase I needed to go into surgery. My sister came after her appointment but because she missed out on time to herself she abused my mother (even though she had 3 hours before the appointment baby free) she screamed at her saying she needed help and its always something with me or my son and mom is never there for her and all kinds of horrible things. The conversation ended with my sister saying she was done with the whole family and didn't need us. I'd been texting her in the hospital and asking how her appointment and I didn't get any response. I found out later in the day what happened after finding my mother bawling her eyes out. I was livid. 

The next down I realised she blocked me on facebook. 3 days later she text my mother an apology I don't know what it said but Mom said she isn't ready to forgive her which is very unlike her(she has even cancelled her christmas dinner). On the 4th day she asked what was wrong with my ankle. I bluntly explained that it was fucked and I have to take care of my son in crutches and with a boot for 2 weeks followed by a month of a brace. She said wow that sucks let me know if you need help which on a paper sounds nice but her offering of help is always disengenous. I didn't reply. Day 6 she tried calling twice, I didn't answer. She texted R U mad at me? And I ignored it. Day 8 two calls ignored again. We are on day 10 now. I still haven't contacted her. 

I know she has issues with her mental state, I know things are hard for her but after everything she has done I am just too tiered to continue a relationship with her. My Husband hasn't liked her since she made a commotion at our wedding she he keeps telling me just to ignore her but his view point is bias. So Am I the Asshole here? Should I just give her a pass because she is struggling with some sort of mental issues? And ultimatley what should I say to her? Thanks for reading

TL;DR My sister who has a history of mental issues blew up at my Mom after having to cancel baby sitting time due to me badly injuring my ankle. It's been 10 days and I still haven't spoken to her. "
697,8dy5md,"WIBTA if I talked to my roommate about his girlfriends obnoxious behaviors? Her name is Christy, my roommates name is Brad. They've been together maybe 2 months and are constantly together like a high school couple (we're 21). She's really nice, but when they have sex she makes the absolute loudest noises I've ever heard her make. It seems like she's trying to get attention from those not in the room, as when we play music to deafen it she seems to get louder. This makes me, my guests and my brother (who also lives with us) very uncomfortable. I've brought it up once before, she apologized, and it didn't stop. One of my friends, who Brad and I will be living with soon, said hes going to ""make Brad pay for sound proofing if that shit keeps happening"". Another one of my friends had to go on the porch it made him so uncomfortable. 

It's not just the sex noises though. She forced herself into our DND group (nobody wanted her to play) and her oversexualized antics negatively impact the game. I was walking Brad through a scenario and Christy started kissing all over him to the point I just fucking gave up. We were all really excited about this campaign, but everyone is already so tired of her I'm afraid she's going to run all of the players off. My gf and I went on a double date with them, and she resorted to obviously taking pictures of her underwear under the table and sending them to Brad. We find it to be inconsiderate and just immature, and Brad doesn't do anything about it.

I could go on and on about the other obnoxious shit she does, like embarrass our climbing group by swinging and yelling on the ropes at our gym, or constantly interject to tell long winded, clearly exaggerated stories about herself. 

WIBTA if I told him that he needs to talk to her about it. If he said no, WIBTA if i just talked to her about it? It's my brother and it's apartment too, and it often ruins our conversations and hanging out with friends. I feel like I have the right to ask him to shut her up or I will. "
698,dso8n2,"AITA for ghosting a business contact after hearing a romantic confession? Recently I (28F) got a text from a business associate who we'll call Dwight, telling me that he had been in love with me after we had a signed contract on an investment fund project together.  

Dwight and I have been friends for a few years and share a friend group. If our project managed to launch with full funding, we could all expect to see a decent amount of revenue come in. I almost offered to do it for free but was persuaded to instate a contract by my peers because this would keep things from getting messy and after some back and forth Dwight and I settled on a percentage with minimal friction. He was always very supportive/generally a good dude and we texted semi-frequently prior to this just because we follow the same shows.

But Dwight's family is rich and he's kind of been pampered by everyone. I saw this slowly manifest in him more heavily as time went by - at first he'd get my coffee but it eventually grew into him offering to literally bring me to Paris.  He's also really insecure and tries to do everything possible to put on airs. Hence, the texts got more aggressive and flirty to which I would always try to veer the conversation in a different direction. Anyway, if you can't tell already, he holds the power in this contract as I am mostly a consultant/designer and get most of the info from him, though I have been in contact with other people on the project that would also be able to function as a middleman between me and our investors.

Despite Dwight's quirks though, he was a successful figure in the industry and I had previously asked him for professional advice in the past. I found it odd that he wouldn't really ever give negative feedback. However, after the texting just got really out of hand (asking to go out on the weekly, guilting me into responding/going out if I didn't respond to something in a few days - usually a meme or unrelated news, etc), I just went radio silent after he ""playfully"" accused me of never wanting to see him because I wouldn't go to lunch with him. He'd also insist on walking me back and grabbing my hand towards the peak of the aggressive behavior. He freaked out and it took me 2hrs to calm him down. That's when he told me he loved me. At that point I was just angry since it felt like my entire skillset was invalid.

I haven't responded to any of Dwight's texts - he's tried to apologize but only after trying to tell our friends his side first and told them I said things like ""let's ~~not~~ go to a ~~club~~ romantic place"" and ""let's go ~~somewhere not crowded~~ be alone together""- this would be super out of character for me as I'd rather chug turpentine than watch The Notebook. It's been  a few months now and things are progressing but I'm still pissed and don't really know how to respond without lashing out, which I feel like makes me look really unprofessional. Am I the asshole for dragging this out?"
699,ewzsf6,"AITA for not wanting our cats locked in her room? So me and my roommate recently moved from a five bedroom apartment to a two bedroom and decided to get cats since we both like them and we are allowed to have pets here. We went into it expecting to share the cats. I ended up paying their adoption fees, for the vet visits and shots, food, toys, litter boxes and taking care of them on a daily basis feeding them, changing their water bowls, and scooping their litter. We got them right before thanksgiving and she was planning on being gone that Wednesday through Sunday, and then two weeks around Christmas. Because of that we decided that we both agreed the cats should not be out unsupervised while they were getting used to us and live in one persons room, and since she was going to be gone, that would be my room. 

Fast forward a month, the cats sleep in my room, I’m their only caregiver for intents and purposes, she only occasionally feeds them at night. I’ve paid almost $2000 between adoption fees and multiple vet visits and all the fun stuff cats need. She’s paid about $250. 

We both naturally sleep with our bedroom doors closed, but she asks I sleep with my door open at night so the cats can choose where they want to sleep. The first night they’re out, one takes down the Christmas tree. Of course. I do forget every now and then I will admit but I’m trying. This has been another month, so we’ve had the cats two months, the cats are completely settled in and sleep with me every night. 

Roommate approaches me and wants to close the cats in her room for the next while because she doesn’t like that they sleep with me. Now, she already went in my room when I wasn’t there and moved their litter box out (which I then had to buy another because the cats were still trying to use the litter box there even though it was gone). Since I am the one who is taking care of them primarily and at this point they are pretty settled in and bonded with me, I am not inclined to agree with this. However, we did agree to share them. AITA for saying no?"
700,bp97n3,"AITA? i refused my fake friend shelter for the night. So this story happened about 2 weeks ago.

First a little backstory; Im a student living alone. i was raised in a small municipality outside the city i live in rn.

So when i first came here, it was good. I was sick of high school and was ready to move on. . I found several people that had the same interests as me ( in the same class) and i enjoyed spending time with these ""friends"". Keep in mind, that these people was already acquainted with each other before i came. I found that i fit well with the others and i had a great time in general the first 2-3 months.

This, however is where all the happy memories end. Because somewhere between december-january i found myself growing away from these so-called ""friends"". We started disliking eachother ( me vs. the 3 others), we exchanged insults, I felt more and more outside (as i wasn't included in outside activities) and they had a knack for talking behind my back. (something i discovered as my closest friend studying the same as me) told me so. These classmates also had  influence over the others, making other people within the same study line dislike me off their lies and fake rumors.

So you could imagine the spot i was in.

\-1-3 close friends (spread out between different schools, lines of studies and parts of the city)

\-i hated my classmates (& they hated me)

\-too shy to make new friends

Now for the main story.

So in norwegian culture, you can become a ""russ"" the same year as you graduate (russ are often 17-19 years old). (these people are notorious for partying, dressing up, acting wild and doing irrational things). And these people decided to throw a huge (unofficial) party in the city park. a short walk from where i live

So then, a week before the party, my ""friend"" who lives 30 minutes (by car) outside the city asks my if he could crash at my place until the morning. I agree to this, as this was the ONLY guy who ACTED genuinely nice towards me. (and i was greatly deceived by this act). I then hear from my real & close friend 5 days later, that this guy had also been talking smack behind my back. Mentioning how much he despises me and that he was planning to ""Steal whatever is loose around"" and ""Take some of his things and burn them"" Whenever i fell asleep.

In that moment i was furious. Both because i had been bamboozled so hard AND that he had the nerve to plan something like this after i showed such hospitality. I then immediately messaged him saying that the deal is over. No sleepover, no nothing. (no mentioning of my precious insider). 

I should also mention that this guy was quite intimidating. Weighing 260-ish lbs (120-ish kgs) and being 190 cm tall.

I contated my teacher

&#x200B;

So then when the party came, i heard that he didn't have any place to stay, and so he had to sleep at a bus stop. I later discovered that someone had stolen his cellphone and wallet while he was asleep.

&#x200B;

My enormous ego tells me im in the right, but am i really though?"

702,c2lrag,"WIBTA if I stole my old roommate's neglected cat? So this is inspired by a post I saw on here yesterday where OP peed on their roommate's stuff, because the cat had peed on their stuff first... gross. OP received criticism for not helping the cat and now I'm thinking about my situation and feeling guilty again and wondering what I should do. 

My boyfriend and I recently moved out from a house we shared with one roommate (used to be a couple but they broke up). Roomie herself was chill, but was often busy and not home much. So Roomie had this cat that was rarely pet, stayed outside a lot, and there was a litter box but it was almost always full and very smelly. Roomie never seemed to care, but she would change it if asked politely. The cat was desperate for attention, but she often had open wounds and scabs all over her so nobody ever wanted to cuddle with her. I felt bad when I would push her away, but I also have a dog and he gets possessive around other animals.

Around March, the cat started doing this weird thing where she would sit in one corner of the kitchen all day and night, literally for hours at a time. She would just sit motionless, sometime staring at the wall but usually facing us but staring at the ground. I thought she might be in a lot of pain, and when I mentioned it, Roomie just said that she was taking her to the vet soon. The cat also frequently peed on my stuff, Roomie's stuff, and just the floor, which I thought might be a UTI or something, but I kind of let it go and hoped this vet appointment would come soon.

I moved out at the beginning of June, and it took everything in me not to pack up the cat with my things and take her to a rescue somewhere. I just knew if I did it around my move-out time, it would probably look suspicious. Roomie always said how much she loved and cared for the cat so I was also scared of really upsetting her if the cat were to disappear. But now that I'm gone, I keep thinking of the cat. Who is putting food down for her when Roomie leaves town for days? Has her litter box been changed at all since I left? I expressed this to my boyfriend and he kind of jokingly said that we could catnap her and take her to a rescue. I thought that was way too wild, but now I'm thinking that it might be ""the right thing to do"" for the cat. I'm a little scared that Roomie would go ballistic and start searching all over town, but honestly if I pick the cat up from outside the house and turn her in as a stray somewhere, I don't think it would get back to me...

TLDR: Would I be the asshole if I kidnapped my old roommate's neglected outside cat and took her to \[hopefully\] a better life?"
703,bu8y44,"AITA for telling my father to fuck off for telling me I need to get my daughter into basketball? I feel like I was too harsh and even my husband thinks I could have done it better but I feel like that's partly because he hasn't felt the full weight of my father's micromanagement. 

Growing up I had certain interests, I was VERY into these activities. Around the time I was in the 8th grade my sister got jealous of the success I was having in this area. After that point I was strongly ""discouraged"" from taking part in these activities unless it was at school. Instead they pushed me to work with children. They told me it was my gift (super Christian family) and that I shouldn't squander my talent. 

So there's the background on why I think I responded so strongly. My youngest daughter is tall and always has been. She's 11 years old and 5'6"" and is still growing. Starting at about age 5? My father has pushed me to make her do basketball. Because she's tall, I mean let's ignore the fact that she inherited my clumsy gene, that she's a very shy girl, that she hates crowds and noise. Ugh.

Anyway a few days ago I made a rare visit to my parent's house, I felt it was safe because family friends were there. I was bemoaning the utter lack of art day camps or just evening classes. All three of my girls love art so I'm looking for something that they will actually enjoy. 

My father brought up fucking basketball again. ""You need to get youngest daughter into it, who cares if she doesn't want to. You're the parent just tell her she's doing it.""

Honestly it brought up a lot of really shitty feelings that I didn't realize were still hanging around. I got up grabbed my purse and told him he could fuck off and left. So reddit am I the asshole for my reaction here? Was I overreacting? I'm really torn here, I'm generally a people pleaser but I really don't think I was out of line and I'm certainly not going to apologize, because I'm not really sorry. Which makes me wonder if I'm an asshole for not apologizing."
704,dpxm1b,"WIBTA if I didn't take out the yard waste? This is a basic little post I guess but I'm curious what you guys would think.

I live in a building that is mostly old folks, I'm 30 and the next person in age is a lady who is about 50 I'd guess. Occasionally I get asked for favours, and I don't mind. My upstairs neighbour (75ish) needed help activating a Visa gift card, no problem, last night the little old lady across the hall (70ish) asked if I wouldn't mind carrying her yard waste bin out for pick up, I said sure!

She asked if I could do it before work in he morning, I leave around 6am but I told her I'd take it out when I put out my trash the night before. She was worried about kids getting up to mischief since it's Halloween but I assured her it'd be fine, it's cold and rainy and kids will all be in early.

So, sure enough, the weather report was right, it's a cold crappy night, not many kids out, so I put out my garbage and compost and I put her yard waste out.

Just a moment ago I heard some noise in the hall and I peeked through the peephole to see her struggling to drag the bin inside and leave it by her door. 

Now, to be perfectly clear, I don't think I'll be petty about it and I'll just put it back out in the morning as she's clearly demanding, but would I be the asshole if I just walked past the bin in the morning? I'm all for helping out but it just seems odd to me to ask for such a minor favour and yet demand that it be done to her specifications and at my inconvenience. 

Not only that but... If kids are gonna make trouble there'll be a mess anyways since everyone else in the building has their bins out, only hers is safely inside... I don't get it.

Anyways, what do you guys think?"
705,ejikpq,"AITA for making my roommate move out? First ever post, sorry for any errors. I can't quite fit everything in here, so if you have questions please feel free to ask.

Several months ago I (M21), along with my dog, moved in with a friend (F20) of mine to a new house we rented together. We had both been looking separately for our own places, but agreed we'd be a good fit to get our own place together as we had been good friends for awhile and got along great.

About a month after we moved in, she asked if she could get a cat. I was cool with it, but about 2 days after she asked she arrived home with **two** cats. I had asked that she get a pet gate to keep their food and litter boxes separate from my dog, which didn't happen.

Next, her new bf started staying over nearly every night and staying by himself during the day while we were gone. She even got him a key to the house. To me, having him and his (unannounced) buddies over all the time was already enough, but giving him unlimited access to the place was too much. That and the fact that he wasn't paying for anything, either. I ended up spending most of my nights shut in my bedroom with my dog, and when we went out of my room I had to keep him on a leash so he wouldn't get into the garbage and cat stuff that was left out during the day. Eventually, he brought drugs in to the house and started keeping them there. Weed is one thing, acid is another.

This all came to a head when I had a small party. The only issue that ever arose was that many of my friends were also her friends that she also worked with and her relationship with her bf was being kept secret to ""avoid drama"". Everything was cleared beforehand, but just as my friends showed up, I got a text from my her that they no longer wanted me to have anyone over. Shortly after that, she sent back another text stating that she changed her mind again, but that she didn't want anyone from her work being there. As you can guess, one of the two people already here was a coworker, who she had just said earlier was cool to bring by when I first asked. Eventually, she walked out and saw us on the couch. She went back to her room and sent a text: ""Why is X here? I asked you for this one thing and now (BF) is really uncomfortable here."" I texted back telling her that she agreed first that they could be here, and that her flip-flopping on which of my friends could or couldn't be here while she was shut in her room was totally unfair.

The next day she met me in the living room where she said that she didn't think this was working out and very strongly hinted that I should move out. I told her that I couldn't just pick up and move again. I asked why, and she said that she wanted her bf to move in. I put my foot down and refused to move, saying that I wasn't going to move just to make her happy. I offered several times to work things out, but she refused to work with me.

Within two weeks she had moved out and into a new place with her bf.

I hate the sofa, it hurts my back, and if she wants to be alone she can be uncomfortable. So I just got in bed anyway.

She always says she forgets or gets busy getting drunk or high. When I brought it up she sighed and made it seem like I was being upset over nothing.

708,bx3ysm,"AITA for vaping at work? Throwaway, HR is involved- don't want to disclose too much info as people at my work know my account

So, before I start I just want to say I (19m) am a long time smoker. I come from a troubled past, came to Canada from Korea w/ my family, and we were dirt poor living in a very bad area of town. I did a lot of bad things growing up, smoking included, however, one day I just woke up and grew up, and got in to university on a full ride scholarship to my first choice in university. Right now I work as a sales associate at a car dealership for the summer.

So I have been trying to quit smoking for 2 years now, I've relapsed twice, and I've found chewing nicotine gum or vaping to be a better alternative, my goal is to completely stop w/ any nicotine products by the end of this summer, I rarely ever use the vape, and I have slowly been putting less and less volumes of nicotine in the juice, however I will occasionally take a ""vape"" break just like the smokers at our work do, they have 20 mins but I try and only stay out for 5 mins before heading back to work.

Some people are telling me vaping is not the same as smoking and they are progressively going from passive aggression, to slowly just being full on aggressive towards me. One lady in particular who you would define as your typical Karen gets extremely angry, she complains that I'm just trying to waste time to my boss, and she always gives me the dirtiest looks to me when I go out to take a vape break amongst the other smokers. I got called in to the HR reps office, and she told me I was no longer permitted to ""waste time vaping"". 

I told her that I have just as much of a right to be out there w/ the smokers wasting time smoking, and the way I see it, I'm not even going out there everyday, I'm trying to quit, and I'm rarely out there. I told her my POV and said that its not a problem and I will stop.

the ""Karen"" was literally waiting right outside and asked what happened, I told her that I was no longer gonna be taking smoke breaks and she said 

""Good because its kind of an asshole move for you to try and take a break when we have a legitimate reason- we can't help ourselves, stop trying to look cool and take time off work, ok?""

AITA? I don't think I am, I just want to see if vaping and smoking is actually all that different, I really think that everyone is just overreacting."
709,ek9jkv,"AITA for blowing up at my ex-friend? **DISCLAIMER : I'M ON A PHONE **

So this happened literally over the course of the 29th to today. But over the entire time I've known her small disputes have happened ending up with her telling me to f--k off and blocking me just to friend me back a couple days later. In the recent months it has happened more and more frequently. 

29th :
Woke up, sent streaks and mornings out. So I usually get a morning back, and have a quick please try with each person unless they don't reply. So get no reply from her(Let's call her Megan) which is normal. I send a hello about 3 hours later and we have a quick conversation about random stuff when she asks what I think she should do for her A levels. Be it she already knows I won't choose her options as I believe it's your choice fully because it can decide your future. So Megan has a small go at me saying How's she's indecisive, autistic and how she can't decide what her favourite colour even is. So I just calmly tell her ask other people because I won't. She stops replying at that point.

30th:
 Today I basically only got a f--k off and block from her. 

3rd:
She unlocks me and attempts to talk to me but I give short, curt answers. To attempt to relieve the tension I send a couple memes and stuff but it's obvious neither of us are really in the mood to talk with the other. So we just say bye and stuff and me being me I say '**Sleep well Megan**'. As I do with everybody. Well most. There's some people I am good with and we tell each other to watch out for killers or whatever. So anyway. Later on around 7pm I get a message from her saying she's sorry for the freak out she's just frustrated because (and this is icing on the cake) her parents taking her to see a Broadway show she wanted to see.

4th:
I text her that morning to check up. Once again I ask how the options are going and she responds. '*Fine, but no f--king thanks to you*'. I answer with my belief again as its one thing I stand by that all important options should be made the one it affects the most. She then replies  with this. '*You know what? Just f--k off. I don't want to speak to your f--king rude a-- at the moment. All you do is refuse to help me.*' At this point I'm getting angry because I'm just standing by my beliefs and she's insulting me for it. So I reply with '**Look I get that you couldn't see your show but that doesn't mean that you can just have a massive go at me for it. I repeatedly just try to be a good friend but you consistently tell me to f--k off and block me. This exact behaviour is why at the moment I doubt there is a high chance of us being acquaintances, much less friends by the end of 2020**'She then blocked me.

710,cp0v9g,"AITA for trying to plan a vacation with my friends?  I have a group of buddies who like to get together a couple time a year in different cities throughout the U.S. When I was younger, not married and not as busy at work, I would go on most of these trips and have a great time. Now, with more responsibilities I have not been able to make any of them for several years. It's especially hard that I'm not included in the planning. I'm just asked after all the arrangements are made if I want to come with them. Last year's trip was out of the country, the dates were set and I was asked to join them for the trip that was to take place the following month. I would have absolutely loved to have gone but I am the only senior manager for my company at my location and I run my own business on the side so I need more time to plan something like that. I want to see these folks and plan a trip so I decided to be the initiator. I suggested we do a trip, gave an example location and suggested a time that's about 12 months out so everyone will have time to make arrangements. A few of them thought it would be a great idea except one (my closest friend and link to the group). We went back and forth through text, him accusing me of intentionally not wanting to go on vacation with them and all of a sudden wanting to plan something. He basically became brash and accused me of being an A$$. All I want to do is plan a vacation with friends I haven't seen in several years. AITA?"

Our relationship is incredibly strained, so we mostly try to stay away from each other, but he asked me to put away the already clean dishes that were in the dish washer. I said sure, I'll do it. I got started doing that. About three dishes in, I come across what looks like an empty container that formerly had butter or something in it. I'd never seen it before, so I asked him where I should put it. He grabbed the dish from me and started ranting at me for not wiping the water off of it because I figured I'd do that after he told me where it should go. Then he says I'm not doing things properly because I have a stuffed animal in my arms while I'm working, even though I can still use both my hands just fine. I'm diagnosed autistic and looking into an OCD diagnosis. I have this insatiable urge to be holding something at all times; Usually it's my phone, but it's turned to this stuffed animal since I got it in the mail. After all this ranting, he grabs the towel I was using to dry the dishes and dismissively says that he'll just do it himself. Ok, sure. I just kinda shrugged and went back to my room. 

He immediately blew up. He followed me without missing a beat and started ranting at me that I'm lazy and I should have told him ""no, I've got it"". I don't understand how he could have reasonably expected that from me when he plain as day decided my work wasn't satisfactory and took matters into his own hands. He started bitching about how he had to clean the entire kitchen and the least I could do was empty the dishwasher. I'd... Already started it before he interrupted my work by saying he'd do it himself. I'm confused and frustrated and he's sending incredibly mixed messages at this point, so I just lock my door and tell him that I'm not emptying the dishwasher. He starts begging me to. I just ignore him. He goes into a bitchy rant bringing up irrelevant things I've done to him and says he's going to ignore me and make me sad next time I want him to try my food (I just got into cooking) or show him something cool. He's probably gonna get dad to harp on me for how lazy I am. 

So, uh, yeah."
712,9pq5ip,"AITA for almost attacking an elderly motorist who caused me to total my car? So last December, I was in my first ever car accident while up at university. Basically, I was coming back through the town and this old fart pulls out of a parking lot on the other side of the road, comes all the way over to my side, making me swerve and crash into a telephone pole, totaling my car. Not only that, but when he swerved the opposite way, a person collided with him and their passenger suffered a broken arm.

When the State Troopers arrived (my college is in a small town), I flew off the handle at the old man. My words went from ""Do you know you could've killed someone?"" to ""What the fuck were you thinking you fucking retard?! Do you know how much I had to fucking pay for that fucking car?!"" very quickly. I was *this close* to throwing hands. All the while there's a woman being loaded into an ambulance with what I'm assuming is her husband holding her hand.

And the Troopers were thankfully very understanding and just calmly told me to wait by my car and gave me time to collect myself and calm down. But man I was fuming all day and night into the next day. My parents brought me a rental (we had good renter's insurance) and I just broke down in my apartment just out of anger and hatred.

In the end, the troopers gave me a police report with a signed statement from a witness and just told me to call my insurance company when I could, which I did. I've since gotten a new car.

Looking back, I realize how little my anger served me and that there were bigger things at the stake than just my car. And if that motorist who caused the accident just happens to come across this post, I just want to say I'm sorry for what I said and I hope you've learned to at least be more attentive when you drive"
713,cb8y81,"AITA for not making more of an effort to go to therapy weekly? A couple months ago my girlfriend found one of my accounts here that I used to comment on gonewild-type subreddits. She reacted severely especially after I admitted to going to camgirl sites though I stopped shortly after I started dating her. I agreed to stop visiting such sites and have. However she later claimed that she believes I have a deep addiction similar to what caused a previous partner to have an affair after she caught him on such sites before. She also referred to this as ""cheating"" and refuses to use any other term, she'll still say things like ""before I found out you cheated on me"" and once messaged me a bunch of memes while I was at work from a Facebook group called something like ""Cheaters Go to Hell"", berated me with things like ""you fucking cheater"" and talked about she'd love to cheat on me to get back.

The more extreme behavior stopped but she demanded I go to therapy. She had insisted on this in the last but now made it an ultimatum that if I didnt by a certain date she'd leave. So I did once, using some of my job's free HSA deposits. However she then demanded I continue and after pointing out that I can't afford it weekly and that my deductible before insurance kicks in is quite high she'll just reslind with something vague like ""if it's important you'll find a way to make it work."" At one point she said if I can't afford it I should get a second job.

It turns out my work offers a few free sessions through one of their programs and I got a large HSA deposit. I've used this to go a few more times. However the two therapists I talked to said I don't appear to be a sex addict and don't believe I need an in depth program. My girlfriend was so upset when I told her this she started demanding I find another therapist. At one point she upped the demand to go twice a week but backed down but said she would require that later if I didn't ""show improvement"". Please note I did quit the sites that upset her and even most internet porn with a few relapses. 

My girlfriend freaks out every time i miss a week, accuses me of not caring about ""recovery"" and insists this needs to be the #1 priority in my life and if I have to go behind on my bills so be it. Even the therapists disagree. She still refuses to listen because she required more than weekly therapy after the previous affair. At one point she even said she'd just put the relationship on hold and only return in a few months if I could show proof of regular therapy, regular attendance at sex addicts phone conferences and a letter from the therapist saying I'm ok to re-enter with just semi-regular check ins on my progress. My therapist said this was an absurd demand no therapist would do.

AITA for this? I feel bad about what I did, but I don't see how enforcing weekly therapy is a solution especially as I quit that behavior."
714,bde65i,"AITA for telling my girlfriend that I dont want to be her slave. so I've been with my gf (Gemma 27f) for 2 years and it's been pretty amazing. 
me (tom 26m) 
so ever since we started dating she has had horrible periods, like home sick from work kinda horrible. around one year in I suggested that she get tested for endometriosis as my sister has it and they both have similar symptoms. she brushed me off and we moved on. 

this was until 4 months ago when we moved in together. I feel like her slave who has to do everything for her on the days that her endo is bad. she will not help with any chores, I dont care so much, but It can get annoying when she then tells me its not done right and then re does it while complaining that I made her clean the house while sick. i don't think I'm a bad cleaner. 

so I asked again about getting tested and she got mad at me for pushing her to do this and that she would do it on her own time when she feels ready. 

yesterday I had had enough, she had complained for 20 minutes and made me get her takeaways from the shops. when I said no she called me a horrible boyfriend so I did it so I would not start a fight. 

so we now go to the argument, I told her that when her endo is bad I feel like a slave who has to do everything she wants, I also said that getting tested could help so much and get her on the right path to making herself better. 

she burst into tears and locked herself in our bedroom. about 20 minutes or so later one of her friends calls me and tells me what a garbage boyfriend i am to make her do something she does not want to do. 
I then got some messages from her friends basically telling me the same thing. 

I tried talking to her today and she will not speak to me except when she said I think it's best we break up. 

I now feel like a mega asshole for bringing it up so often.

I hate tampons so I exclusively use pads. I'm sort of a forgetful person in the mornings, so at night, I leave out one or two unopen pads on the bathroom counter so I see it when I wake up & remember to change my pad. I didn't realize this was a problem, until my mom told me I need to keep them them away in the cupboard with the rest of my stuff so they're not left out because it makes my brother kind of uncomfortable to see them out.

My attitude is wtf? They're UNUSED AND UNOPENED pads & I don't see the big deal. I told her he can just live with it. AITA?

So my(19M) sister(14F) is having her first homecoming tonight and she is having photos taken at our house with my dad and step-mother (42M&48F). I have extra curricular things I do at college from 12-8 on Saturday and earlier this week I asked my dad when my sisters homecoming was and he said it was at 6 on Saturday. I inform him that I won’t be able to make it because of my extra curricular stuff I do. I never got an answer but that happens a lot with my family. 

So fast forward to last night (Friday) I was drinking the last of an ice tea that I found in my room thinking that I had left it there from the week before. About 3 hours later my sister comes in my room and asks for it because apparently it was hers I said I was sorry and she just blows up at me.

On top of the 200$ bridesmaid dress.

718,dts2h5,"WIBTA if I told my step-mother I didn't want a Christmas gift from her or my father? Hi reddit,

Five months ago I stopped talking to my father. To make a long story short: he has some really horrible racist and misogynistic beliefs. In the past few years, he's ruined pretty much every family gathering by getting drunk and shouting terrible things at everyone. Things reached a boiling point five months ago when he got drunk and, in addition to a slew of other nonsense, told me women shouldn't be allowed to run for political office because ""your brains just work differently."" He completely ruined the family trip we were on - which was particularly devastating because it was the last time either of us were going to see my brother before he was deployed overseas. He got really belligerent that night, and my brother and I ended up leaving and tried to make the most of the trip without him or my step-mother. I haven't spoken to him since. 

This is where I might be the asshole - he's made a few efforts to apologize since then and has stopped drinking entirely. But honestly this was just the straw that broke the camel's back. I don't want to have a relationship with him anymore. My brother thinks I should forgive him. He thinks our dad took our grandmother's passing really hard - she died a couple years ago and he's been struggling mentally ever since. 

I've kept in contact with my step-mother. She's not happy that I won't talk to him, but she's also trying to be understanding. Lately she's been asking me for a Christmas list. I've been ignoring her requests for a few days now but she's getting more and more persistent. I don't feel comfortable accepting gifts from my father, because I feel like he's going to use it as a means of manipulating me into speaking with him again. 

AITA for not accepting my father's appologies? WIBTA if I told my step-mother that I don't feel comfortable asking for a Christmas gift?

719,dwk2tm,"WIBTA if I got students from my school to sign a petition to have a teacher ""talked"" too? This teacher... Isn't really good. He's just so hard to understand and everyone is failing his class because of him. He doesn't stop fights, targets kids, and when students lose their supplies he just tells them to take other students' things. I once lost my workbook for 2 months and found it all the way across the room in a different desk. We told him that instead of telling kids to take other books he should tell kids to look for the missing books but he doesn't listen? He never answers questions and yells at us to ""make a mistake!!!"" Which no one understands what he means by that. He refuses to try and help kids saying they should find out on their own by ""rereading the problem 15 times"" And he seems a little sexist? The girls would get away with so many more things because they spoke up so he's practically given up on trying to stop them, and he always targets these 3 boys who don't even do anything wrong. Just for not understanding things. 

Students already tried telling the principle and they sent people to sit in the class while he teaches. Of course, instead of yelling at us to ""make a mistake"" he answered questions (aka whispering the answers to us) and went over things that we didnt understand (he still sucked though) but right after that, he went back to how he normally taught. He tried to give kids detention but the parents already found out that he was dumb so the parents would just say that it was ""inappropriate that my child got in trouble for not understanding"" yet they don't do anything to see what the problem is!

The petition is more of a last hope option if he doesn't actually start trying. I hope we don't actually need to use it. He could probably be a good teacher for young kids, maybe elementary? But he's just kinda rude also. The smart kids are starting to get worse grades, not because they are getting the wrong answers but because he doesn't grade things correctly? He makes the mids grade homework and tests but the papers are never in order so when he says the answer its never the right one and he doesn't even re-check it and it's just a mess. It's not anything personal against him, it's not that we just ""dont like him"" (obviously it's something more when the quiet kids like me are starting to get angry). We just don't want to get bad grades. 

WIBTA if we gave in the petition explaining why? We dont expect them to do anything but still. It's worth a try. (Obviously, _I_ wouldn't be going. I'm far too scared to do that. We would probably go in a group)"
720,9w8l9c,"AITA for not wanting to dance with a certain girl in my school musical? **TLDR at the bottom**

Some notes before I begin:

* I am 16M and in 11th grade.
* I am not comfortable in holding other people's hands, being close to someone I don't know too well, etc.
* I have Asperger's, so I am relatively introverted. Note that I am high functioning, and most probably don't notice it until I say that I am, to which they say, ""Makes sense!"" (I am not offended by this)
* Despite what is stated above, I like doing theater... granted, this is my first *school* show.

So at my school, there's a musical that I am currently in. I'm a ""Chorus Boy"", so I basically act as a stage prop in the background until I actually do things like dance or maybe even sing.

Then we get to a girl that I will name Susie (not actual name).

Susie is a freshman that has some tendencies that I think are odd. She gets obsessed with other people or other things pretty frequently, she constantly gets absurdly close (literal sense) to other people (especially guys, but they're fine with it sometimes), she's a bit loud, and she randomly scowls at other people, although I'm not sure if it's intentional.

One thing I should expand upon is Susie's ""obsession"" with other people: I don't think it's really so much of an obsession as much as it is a joke obsession that Susie herself treats a little *too* seriously, but other girls in this class will tell her something like, ""Oh, I think John Doe has a crush on you"", and she'll run up to John, hug him, call him her boyfriend, and etc. This ""boyfriend"" changes every single day. Most of the guys find this more amusing than anything else, and Susie is kind of like the ""mascot"" of theater class, as everyone seems to like her... except for *me.*

I have never been openly rude to her before, and none of the other girls say anything to Susie about me (at least, I don't think), and I don't plan on being rude to her, I just don't want to hang around her.

Now to the actual story.

There's a slow dance portion in the musical, and everyone in the musical *has* to participate in it, no exceptions. As I've stated, I am uncomfortable near/touching other people, but this slow dance portion was not much more than holding hands, having the girl's hand on the guy's shoulder while the guy has it above their hip, and touching cheeks. I'd gladly bear through it for the sake of being a ""chorus boy"", though, and the dance isn't that long.

So when the teacher was calling on people to pair them up, there were very few people left. She called me up and asked me if I had a preference, and I said no. She then asked if I minded being with Susie, and I, forgetting who Susie was, said that I didn't mind. The teacher then called Susie up, told her to go get her dance shoes, and then dismissed her to go get the shoes.

I made an awkward wincing expression after Susie left, and the teacher asked me again if I minded having Susie as a partner. I paused for a few moments and said that I *did* mind, and that I was sorry and hoped I wasn't being rude. The teacher then called on a senior girl to be my partner, and that's about where the story ends.

My main concern is if I was the a-hole for turning her down, even if I didn't do it in front of her face. The sole reason why I  turned her down was because I was uncomfortable with her tendencies.

**TLDR**

* There's a slow dance portion at my school play
* I hate being close to people and am awkward around people
* There's a girl that likes being close to other people and have ""obsessions"" with other boys, typically due to other girls having fun with her
* While the teacher was pairing people for the slow dance, I asked to switch with a different girl when I was selected to dance with her. She allowed me to swap."
721,eggl4y,"AITA for not really feeling bad after something fell on my friend after repeatedly telling him what he was doing would cause that very result? I just finished my first semester of my freshman year of college but this is still bothering me. I made a friend during orientation and some weeks later we were hanging out in my dorm room. He was sitting on a chair and started playing with some plastic shelves over my bed. He was sort of pulling and hanging on them and I told him repeatedly and jokingly to knock it off because they weren't incredibly sturdy (they were made of a really light plastic, I guess for safety reasons since they're meant to go over/around a bed) and they could fall on him. They couldn't possibly hurt anyone (unless like a piece fell directly into someone's eye or something), they were also really annoying and tedious to put back together, not to mention I think people should respect others' belongings when they're guests in someone else's living space. Sure enough, he kept doing it and part of it collapsed, with just some hollow plastic tubes falling on his arms/torso. My first reaction was irritation because things on it fell everywhere and I had to clean those up and put the damn thing back together. He was upset that I didn't make sure he wasn't injured or apologize to him for my shelves falling on him before being like ""this is why I asked you not to do that"". I didn't yell or anything, though I'm sure my irritation was apparent. Apparently he told other people we were acquainted with about the incident and they think I'm some sort of sociopath for not initially falling over myself to make sure he was okay. I should also mention that I'm female, and I wonder if he/those he told the story to would react differently if I were male. Reddit, AITA?"

723,easkhi,"AITA for not texting friends back right away? I've been getting a lot of shit about this, so I thought I'd ask.

I'm a solitary person and I don't like feeling pressured to be available 24/7. I could easily go months without talking to anyone and be content. Most of my friends understand this about me, but some of them get super offended if I take too long to respond. 

Here's an example. One of my friends, Friend A, is kind of high maintenance and gets ticked off if I don't respond to her messages within a day or two. She sends giant walls of text and multiple messages at a time and I'm not always in the mood to reply then and there, especially if it isn't something that requires my immediate attention. I do get back to her within a couple of days and within a week at most. If it's something really urgent, I'll respond right away. 

One of my other friends, Friend B, is way more laid back and normally just sends me memes and music and stuff like that, so if he texts me, I'm more inclined to respond when I open his messages. Recently, Friend A was hanging out with Friend B while I was out of town and saw that I had been texting him recently and blew up at me and accused me of ignoring her. I wasn't ignoring her, I just didn't feel like talking at the exact moment when she messaged me and I wanted to wait until I had the time to give her my full attention. AITA?"
724,9p7m8t,"AITA For yelling at my housemates girlfriend because she chopped up a live fish from our fish tank and fed it to the other fish? After a big night out my housemate, his girlfriend (let's call her The Slaughterer) and a few other friends got back to our house to carry on the drinking antics and play some card games. I wasn't that keen to stay up so I took myself upstairs and went to bed.  

About half an hour later, I needed to come down for a glass of water and as I walked in there was a huge commotion. I was soon advised by the other parties that The Slaughterer had scooped out one of the smaller fish and chopped it up WHILE IT WAS STILL ALIVE on **my** chopping board with **my** knife and proceeded to throw the bits of fish in the tank to feed the other fish.  


I freaked out for several reasons:  


- Firstly, because I think it's inhumane; 
- Secondly, because, yuck, that is my personal knife/chopping board (my housemate doesn't cook);
- Thirdly, because no one told her to stop and they all thought it was hilarious.  


Because I was quite drunk - and for that matter so was everyone else - I started yelling at her saying something along the lines of ""*WTF are you doing?! That is f***ing disgusting!*"" etc. This caused us to both start going off at each other, and her defense was ""*It's no different than cutting up salmon on a chopping board*"" (not to mention this is a freshwater tank and was quite murky with algae at the time).   


Most of the friends there at the time think I overreacted (they thought it was funny) and in hindsight I probably could have handled the situation better if I had not raised my voice.  


I just want some other opinions, AITA in this situation?  


**TL;DR:** Housemate's girlfriend chopped ""pet"" fish alive with my chopping board and knife and fed to the other fish, I yelled at her, she got defensive, friends think I overreacted.

**EDIT/UPDATE:** Thanks everyone. Just a bit of background for anyone interested.. This actually happened a couple of months ago but is something that I have pondered over since. 

Housemate and The Slaughterer have actually been in an off-and-on relationship since the incident, and thankfully she hasn't stepped foot in the house while I've been there (rightly so). The fish tank itself is not mine (it's my housemate's 8ft x 2ft x 2ft - so it's huge) but I have purchased several fish to add to it and also contribute to the maintenance i.e. cleaning, feeding etc. The fish in question was not my fish, but that's beside the point in my opinion. I rent the room off my housemate so I think my main concern was I had no right to yell at his girlfriend in his house and everyone said I went pretty mental and OTT. 

I can now rest assured knowing I was completely in the right to lose my sh*t."
725,eni0t8,"AITA for not keeping my own apartment clean? I live alone and pay my entire rent on my own. My boyfriend lives and works way on the other side of town, and mainly stays with me on the weekends and sometimes a day or two during the week. Recently, I've been working 10+ hours a day and hardly do any cleaning during the week. Call me lazy, but I really prefer to use what little time I have on weeknights to cook, shower, and relax. Last week, my boyfriend arrived at my apartment for the weekend while I was still at work. He sent me the following texts:

*""Did you clean your place? Or am I gonna be mad walking in ?!""*

And a couple minutes later: *""This place is disgusting. I'm honestly getting annoyed""*

Again, not trying to be rude but it is my apartment. I'll admit it was messier than usual, but nothing truly disgusting IMO: a sink full of dishes, dirty pots on the stove, and dirty laundry on the floor. I had been out of town the previous weekend and hadn't even had time to unpack. When I arrived home, he had cleaned up a bit (which I've never asked him to do) – this included throwing out an unopened box of candy that had been sitting out on the counter. I asked why he would do that and he said ""Why was it just sitting out like that?"" and then got all cocky when I didn't have a good answer. Not to be dramatic, but I was looking forward to eating that candy after a tough week at work.

**AITA for not tidying up before he arrived?** I understand that he has a difficult job too, and drives an hour through traffic to get to my place in order to spend time with me – so I do genuinely feel bad that he arrives to a messy apartment. But he's making me feel guilty over something that I already felt bad about on my own. Obviously I'd also prefer for my apartment to be clean at all times, but I feel like the decision of when and how much I clean my apartment should be mine to make. I also want to note that I had surgery last summer, and am still going through physical therapy for that. I am perfectly able to clean now, but it's not as easy as it usually would be.

726,cjfe4f,"AITA for ""not being supportive"" of my gay best friend after we dated? Let's call my best friend of several years Edward. Since he was a guy and I was a girl, everyone had always shipped us as a couple. Out the blue, Edward asked me out over text. We dated for several months. We were having a lot of fun together, and I thought things were going great.

Again out of the blue, he broke up with me. I was given no explanation why. I felt really betrayed by someone who was one of the most important people to me. Edward avoided me as much as he could. (We still had to work together every day as partners in some classes and especially as teammates in a club.) He left our normal friend group and joined another. He wouldn't talk to our mutual friends and teammates about the situation.

A couple weeks later, I started hearing the rumors and stories that Edward was gay. Then some of our mutual friends starting talking to me about our breakup in defense of him even though I was very upset and just didn't want to talk about him. ""He really liked you as a person but wasn't attracted to you."" ""This was his last shot at pretending to be straight."" ""He was just trying to be accepted."" My friend group split up from arguing over whether or no he was in the wrong.

I felt used. I was his way of confirming he was gay. I was his mask to hide behind for a few months.

Months later, he's now fairly open about being gay. But after all this time, he still never directly told me he was gay. I never got the truth. The only thing he's said about our relationship is that he was happy it happened. But I'm not. I don't think it was right for him to use me like that. I'm not glad that it split up our entire friend group. After everything, I'm saddest about losing him as my best friend.

Some of our old mutual friends blame me for our friend group splitting. I wasn't even in any of the arguments between them about whether Edward was in the wrong. I was a bit busy at the time crying and just being sad. But they say that if I was just more supportive of him coming out everything with our friends would have been fine. (Again, he never even came out to me.) If I was more accepting and happy about the situation apparently everything would have been just perfect.

I'm happy that Edward feels like he can be himself now. I really am. But I can't go back to being friends with him like we were before.  I'm not even sure what I could've done to be more supportive but enough people are still telling me I wasn't supportive enough that there must have been something I'm missing. AITA for not being supportive enough of my (used to be) best friend coming out?

&#x200B;

tl;dr My best friend of a long time asked me out. After a while he broke up with me with no explanation and broke contact as much as possible. A couple weeks later he started coming out to people as gay. A lot of people say I'm being unreasonable for being upset and that I'm not being supportive enough of him coming out. My entire friend group split up taking sides over what some claim is my fault. AITA?

&#x200B;

727,d0a3bf,"AITA if I won't bring my overweight father snacks while he's on a diet My dad is always in one of two stages; on a strict diet like keto, or have a 'cheat day', which usually lasts a few weeks till he returns to the intense diet. He's not obese, only overweight, probably due to alcohol consumption in his early 20s-30s, poor eating habits, and lack of exercise after having kids. The thing about these crash diets he uses, is they're pretty unsustainable and if you cheat at all, your progress halts or even reverts. He asks me to bring him snacks like oreo's, chips ahoy, etc. He gets angry at me when I tell him no, and justifies the treat by saying he's lost weight, or he's had a long day. I think this is a little hypocritical as he criticizes me for associating food with mood, or rewards, and tells me I have a poor relationship with food.  I've tried to get him on a more regular diet that focuses on eating healthy amounts of all food groups and exercising regularly, but he insists on these intense diets. I feel bad because he does work hard, and I don't enjoy being punished for not bringing him snacks, so AITA?"
728,9w3o4k,"AITA, for kicking someone out of my life completely? So, I had been seeing this guy for about three months. We didn’t make anything official, but we were constantly with each other. There was a spark there, and I was falling pretty hard. 

Well a couple days ago he gives me the typical “I just wanna be friends, I don’t want anything right now.” Which was fine, I was upset but whatever. 

I’d like to also add that he had lead me on pretty hardcore, we were doing couple things for the last few months. He even told me that he was falling in love with me. 

Okay, well last night some news had gotten back to me. So, my best friend’s sister used to see him too (we are in a small town, so dating someone that has dated someone you know is pretty common). 

So, my best friend came to hangout with me and spilled some beans. So shit dick (the main guy I’m talking about) messaged her sister. Nothing big, I’m not the jealous type. Well, she had asked “don’t you have a girlfriend?” Before anything had been said about not wanting a relationship with me he had told her “no, not anymore.” 

Well, ultimately I was pretty upset because I feel betrayed. So, I told him to come get his shit and get out of my life. I’ve since blocked him from everything and don’t plan on speaking to him. 

TL;DR: I was being lead on for three months, and the person who lead me on decides to message a girl he had be seeing and kept me a secret. So I told him to get the hell out of my life. "
729,cm9m1s,"WIBTA: Sue fence installer for poor install I am asking if I would be the asshole if I proceed:

I have been working with a fence installation company for 3-4 months to get an aluminum ornamental fence installed.  The timeline is of no concern as we had to have the property surveyed and so forth.  Basically, this company's quote was less than everyone else - and while I was wary because I know ""you get what you pay for"" - the company had great reviews...including personal word of mouth from acquaintances.

So the time comes for install and it is easy to tell that many of the fence materials are significantly scratched and bent.  This occurred during shipping/delivery.  Replacements are requested, but from day 1 of install the company is doing a poor job.  Install bent panels, scratching the finish when putting in screws, straight edges are wavy, etc.  Therefore on a daily basis I am reviewing everything that is being done and ensuring everything is fixed.  Thankfully none of the posts initially installed were scratched, so everything was fixable.  Well, now the fence is ""done.""  The company removed dirt I wanted and is trying to charge me for removing the dirt.  The charge is well over $1000...fence is $10,500.  Also, one of the last panels installed is bent and there are scratches all over the fence and also areas that he obviously ""touched up"" with the manufacturer's touch up pen and spray paint - but is very obvious when walking the fence.  Lastly, all 4 corners of the fence are installed VERY poorly.  The pieces were ""overcut"" (his word, not mine) which was an ""error"" (again, his word, not mine), but he is refusing to replace the panels and redo.

Initially the company was going to replace the bent panel, do more touch ups, and provide me a discount due to the scratches.  But, they are now refusing to fix anything since I mentioned the corner joints.  They are refusing to redo the joints because ""aluminum is strong"" and therefore won't void the warranty from the manufacturer.  I have already contacted the manufacturer and they have stated the corners are NOT to required specs, therefore the joint would NOT be covered by warranty.

At this point I am just at a loss and strongly considering suing the company to either force them to redo the corner joints or for reimbursement of hiring another fencing company in the area to come and redo the corners.  If I do this, would I be the asshole?  This is a small, local company...and friends/family think I am just being nitpicky, but I am spending a crap ton of money for a fence and this fence needs to function properly and is also a portion of my property value if/when I ever go to sell this home.

&#x200B;

Edit 1: I have paid a downpayment which was for the materials, which ended up being about 60% of the total cost.  So still a significant amount of money that I owe and I am currently withholding until work is completed.

The dirt removed from my property was ONLY from the holes dug for the posts - so not a ton.  Honestly, I'm not concerned that he removed the dirt from my property, even though I do have a use for it.  I am more concerned that he is trying to charge me over $1,000 for dirt removal I did not want or agree to.

&#x200B;

Edit 2: Final update...I think the owner understood I was serious about not accepting their level of work.  They returned yesterday while I was at work and fixed all of the problem joints, did an excellent job touching up the fence, and we agreed upon a discount (and NO charge for removing the dirt).  So, while it isn't perfect, the price ended up being right and I'm just glad to have it done...finally."
730,d5qjcy,"WIBTA if i asked my mom to stop calling me? I graduated high school a year early, which I guess makes me an early admit to college. I just turned 17 last Friday, meaning for the first month I was about 2 or more years younger than my classmates. 

For this reason, my mother was against me going away for college. She didn’t think I was emotionally ready since I’m young and I suffer from generalized anxiety disorder and depression. My teachers at school (and my therapist) disagreed and said that I demonstrated to them that I can handle myself. She finally said I could go, only if i call her every night at the same time, so she “knows I’m alive”.

I agreed to the phone call thing because I figured it wouldn’t hurt. However, actually doing it has been extremely fucking painful. 

She gets mad if I don’t call at EXACTLY 8:45. So I set an alarm to ease her mind. But now she’s been upset because I don’t sound excited to talk to her. Which, honestly I’m not. If I’m studying, I’ll still call and tell her I’m studying, and then she’ll want to stay on the phone for another 30 minutes, telling me about the cat and her adventures at work. Last week I had the flu, and even with my 103 degree fever she STILL demanded I call her and talk to her. 

Today when we were talking, I was in the middle of studying for my biology test that I have tomorrow. She asked what I was doing and I told her studying, and she said “Oh.” And continued talking for another 30 minutes. After a while of me going “mhm. oh. wow that’s crazy.” and various other dry responses, she yelled and said “You never sound happy to talk to me. Do you want me to just stop calling?”

I would’ve said yes at that moment, but because she was angry that wouldn’t have went down well. So I said no and tried to sound more interested and lively. 

I’m thinking that tomorrow I want to ask her to stop the every day phone call and switch to every week. She’s not old or unable to use technology, she knows how to text me or send voice notes over iMessage. An acquaintance said I’m being an ungrateful brat because that’s my mom and she loves me, and obviously the phone calls are important to her. She also said my mom pays my phone bill so the least I could do is call her. 

I really cannot handle the phone calls anymore. They’re starting to give me anxiety as soon as I see the clock says 8:00. The acquaintance said I’m just making excuses.

**Edit: A commenter told me it’d be worth it to mention in my post that my mother has a history of controlling and abusive behavior. such includes: accusing me of stealing her things when she has misplaced them, calling me retarded, throwing things at me when she’s upset, and a lot of other things. **"

We've had some issues with my brother and SIL since getting engaged (they asked me to change my wedding date after i made a deposit, told me no one would come as its on Halloween, etc) If they were pregnant or had a baby then they wouldn't be in it because they don't let anyone watch the children. They have a 3 year old and are currently pregnant with their second child who will be 8 months old at the time of my wedding.

733,cvwm7p,"AITA for being angry at my mother's phone usage? On mobile, sorry!


Last weekend my mother and I went on a weekend trip to Reno with the intent to gamble (mostly craps). I was really excited as we haven't been on a trip together just the two of us in a very long time. We arrive there Friday night and immediately I notice she hasn't taken her eyes off her phone, I already know she is flirting with a FWB she has (that's a whole different irritation that has nothing to do with the principles here). I shrug it off because I already know if I bring it up she'll quickly get angry and defensive, so I say whatever and we head to the casino. The whole night and Saturday afternoon she is glued to her phone, to the point that it is inconveniencing the dealers at the table. I'm having to pick up her winnings and keep her bets going for her because she won't look up from her phone. Even the pit boss was making humorous comments at her expense and she didn't even hear him. Once Saturday night rolled around her phone died from overuse, and she left it in the hotel to charge. At that point it was like I was there with someone else, we are joking and screaming when we win at the table, all around having an awesome time. Towards the end of the night I make a comment, something like ""Now that your phone is gone I'm having a great time!"" She took it as an insult and called me an asshole, it nearly soured Sunday morning for us as she was still in a bad mood. Luckily she hit a big win on a slot machine on our way out to valet and the ride home was semi-enjoyable. I wish I could say this was uncommon behavior but this tends to be our relationship, me being ignored for whatever device is in her hands. I was hoping for it to be different since it's a freaking casino and we are betting hundreds of dollars. I made 3k from rolling hot in craps for over an hour and she barely noticed. So reddit AITA for being angry over her using her phone so much?"
734,eathzg,"AITA for wanting to choose to go see my biological father who is in critical condition at a hospital over going to a Christmas event with my wife and kids? This all just kind of happened in the past thirty minutes.

I got a call from one of my brothers telling me that our dad is in the hospital on critical life support, and not in good shape. Pneumonia that got really bad apparently. But it’s serious enough that he thought we should round up all the siblings and leave early tomorrow morning to go see him. (He’s about four hours away from us)

So I call my wife and explain. But I can tell she’s angry even though she won’t say it.

Why?

Because we had a Christmas event planned for tomorrow. One of those places where you can go and do activities for the day. And apparently tomorrow is the last day it’s open. So she’s pissed that I’ll be missing out on that.

Of course I’m not happy about missing that trip.  I just feel like the possibility of my dad dying kind of takes priority above that. She disagrees because I only met my dad when I was eighteen and I’ve only seen him in person around a dozen times. So because if that, it shouldn’t be a big deal to me? I mean yeah I haven’t spent a lot of time with him but to me that’s even more reason to go, to spend what time with him is left, if things end up going downhill for him. And I have a feeling that it’s all I’m going to be thinking about if I did go on the family trip.

So, am I the asshole or what? I’ve pretty much made up my mind that I’m going to go see my dad. Wife is on the way home and I’m betting a pretty big argument is going to follow."

738,dyu2mg,"AITA because I'm the teacher, and everything is my fault I am a preschool teacher of 17, 4-year-olds. If you have 4-year-olds you understand sometimes they are wild, not listen, get upset and have normal 4-year-old problems. I have a parent who is always upset with my classroom. By complain I mean, raise her voice, gives an angry expression (she her self said she was being a b\*\*\*H), she tells everyone this is a horrible classroom, school and I'm a horrible teacher. I will list her complains

1) I needed to set up a home visit with her. (its policy I have a home visit with every parent at the beginning of the year)

2) Her son hit a child and she blames the classroom (at the beginning of the year we did have trouble with a boy who would hit when upset, he have fixed those issues.)

3) Her son was afraid of a monster (She blamed me for not listening to every conversation in the classroom to make sure no words of monsters were being said)

4) We are short-staffed. (I agree, I wish I could fix this)

5) The boys ruff house. (I hate this too, but I have 12 boys and 5 girls, they ruff house, we are working on it, but it doesn't help when her son tells them to ruff house.

When she complains I try to be understanding, I know it can be frustrating to have problems with your child's classroom, but I feel the complaints are more her personality than a problem with me. I have taught for 2 years and I have never had a person complain like this. I talk to my boss and she said the mother was the same last year with the other teacher, she is just super hard to please. As far as the child he won't listen in class, asks children to run and ""join a fight club"" When I talk to him about the behaviors he says ""Well my mom is mad at you, She thinks your a bad teacher and this is a bad place.""

I know as a teacher my room can be hectic, but I do not give up and let them break my rules. If they run they walk with me. If they hit they have to make the person feel better. If they don't listen they have to talk to me in a private corner of the room. We have made progress."

I find it very assholish and inconsiderate to have loud parties when you know it must be disturbing peoples sleep.

It was the next street over which my backyard backs up to their backyard.  The house was probably a good 4 to 5 doors down and yet it sounded like it was right next door.

740,7aaxn5,"AITA for ending this friendship? Hi everyone. I recently did something, and my conscience and some of my friends are bothering me about it.

I told an ex I wanted to stop seeing her. Now that in itself sounds pretty straightforward, but there are some specific circumstances to this.

You could say she's not really my ex, because we were only in a fwb situation for about ten months. I wanted to get serious pretty quickly, but she didn't. We started acting more and more like a couple, and when I asked her about being exclusive, she told me that she already assumed that we were exclusive. Even though she didn't want to call it a relationship. I know.

Eventually I told her we could not sleep together anymore as the situation was making me unhappy. When she asked me if we could still be friends, I said yes. I now think that was a big mistake on my part, but that was four years ago.

In those four years, we both grew up a bit. She apologised for the way she treated me. We also grew a bit closer, to the point of seeing each other more often than we did other friends. However, my feelings for her stayed, and we were both aware of this.

She has been dating some guys off and on the last year, which I found hard. I once told her that it might be a good idea to get a bit more of a healthy distance between us, but I backtracked when she started crying. Eventually, she started getting pretty serious with another guy. I decided that I didn't want to meet him, and that I could not honestly have a normal friendship with this girl as long as I felt this way about her. She had a boyfriend now, so it wasn't like I was leaving her all alone.

So I told her that about two months ago. I offered to talk about it if she wants to, but she doesn't. That's fine, it's up to her. I've heard from friends that she's still angry about it. Apparently it's pretty hard on her. Apparently the fact that I did it the moment when she got serious with someone else is also a problem for her and my friends (this one has me stumped, honestly).

I don't care about the anger. I don't care that my friends think I'm an asshole. What are they going to do to me? **I'm free.** What I do care about is the fact that I feel like I have abandoned someone very close to me, and I may have hurt her.

Am I the asshole?

I don't know if I'm presenting all of this in a biased way, one way or the other. I'll check back and answer any questions after I get back from work.

741,an3wy0,"AITA for telling off a girl who canceled plans because she was too nervous? Please read before you rip me apart.

I met this girl who seemed nice enough. I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.


About 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time and a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say ""ok no problem"".

3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say ""its no worries"" and just leave it at that.


Last week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say ""np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer"" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.

At this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.

So I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. 

Should I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally? The way I look at it, is that if this girl who has met me more than 15 times has that big of a problem meeting me in public for a beer that she has to cancel plans she makes on 5 different occasions...then thats not the type of person I'd want to date anyway. 


I know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.

745,b76hfg,"AITA for cutting my now ex-best friend out of my life? Throwaway for obvious reasons.

My former best friend and I have been friends since college, about 9 years now. I have also been friends with her husband since then as well, as I met them both at the same time. I've been through a lot with the both of them; I was MOH at their wedding, she was MOH at my wedding, I've been their through my friend's DUI and legal troubles, etc. 

Since my friend got married to her husband in 2013 she has been pretty flaky, and it's only gotten worse with time. She doesn't answer my texts or calls, sometimes for weeks on end now these days. However, I have always made myself available to her, no matter what time of day, for her phone calls or texts; I always answered right away because I loved and cherished her. She's done some pretty awful things in the past that I've forgiven her for. For example, at my wedding she had to come stag because her husband could not afford to fly in along with her, and she was pretty upset at the idea of 'being alone' during the reception. So, after the dinner at my reception was over she invited some man I've never met to my wedding to hang out with him as her date (she was in an open marriage). That is just one example.

Her life has been on a big downward spiral since 2014-2015. She was an alcholic, got three DUIs and went to jail, has jumped from job to job, and is now going through a separation/divorce with her husband, who I am still good friends with. Not only that, she's had some physical health issues, and has struggled with depression. She recently went to rehab for her alcoholism, for a whopping 45k, which her parents paid for, as they have for nearly everything in her life.

My breaking point was when she ghosted me on a text after she told me she'd gotten into an argument with her mother, whom she and her husband have lived with multiple times throughout their marriage, and she was going to sell all of her things to get a plane ticket to fly back to the state I currently live in. I told her politely that I thought she was acting rash, and that she ought to take a step back before doing something like that. She never texted me again after that. I had to text her husband to find out that she ended up getting the ticket and flying halfway across the US to my state, and that she had already landed safely and had somewhere to stay. Then after all that, two days later and still no text from her, I get an email that she had logged into my hulu account. I was livid. I booted all the devices from my acct and changed my password. 

Since then she has texted me twice; two weeks ago with a Rob Lowe meme, and then a few days ago to brag about a kitchenaid she got for her bday. I ignored her texts. My mom says I should at least be cordial because friend knows she fucked up, but I'm through. My friend hasn't asked me about myself or how I am doing for the majority of our phone calls/texts for the past year.

She plans on sponsoring her parents and 20yo sister from Vietnam to America. They have no assets or savings at all. She plans for them to live with us while her parents will retire at 60 since they will have no English or working skills in America. Her sister has no English also and we will probably be responsible for her college education. The thing is this feels overwhelming for me because I'm 23 and didnt want to sign up for taking care of my wifes family. I'm only making 50k a year right now and my wife is unemployed and still in school. We also live in California so the cost of living is inflated. I think we will never be able to afford a house at this rate yet alone taking care of others. I'd rather care for my own mom before her parents because my mother raised me as a single mother and I greatly appreciate her. My wife doesnt want my mother to live with us. Am I the asshole for not wanting to dedicate my finances to her family? My main reasons is that i feel that it will heavily delay me from ever owning a house, kids, retirement."

     However, the hotel we are staying in has a small pool, and an equally small area surrounding the pool in which there are a limited number of sunbeds.
     Our family of four went to use the pool, but only two sunbeds were completely free, and another two had a towel on, but no bags or books or any other sign they were there. Before using these two sunbeds with towels on, we waited for 10 - 15 minutes to see if anyone would use the sunbeds, they did not come. 
     So we went to remove the towels and use the sunbeds and we were without trouble for around about an hour to an 90 minutes. Then the previous occupents of the sunbeds came and spoke to us. 
     
     Disgruntled, one of them comments that we are in his sunbeds, and I reply: ""You haven't been here for an hour and a half,"" he then says that he had ""Kept these sunbeds reserved,"" 
""You can't reserve a sunbed,""

748,9w2qjy,"AITA for considering to cut a friendship? Just changed to a new account to maintain anonymity, but over the last week I've considered cutting a close friendship entirely. I (27M) have been close friends with a 23F who has ancestry going back to Greece and has strong left lean in politics, whereas I lean to the right on more subjects than not. For context we're both Australian with my ancestry going back to Ireland.

I have been close friends with this lady for roughly two years and we've grown close, we've even made a pact to get married if neither of us find another partner in the next few years. That being said, we keep growing close and then splitting far apart. To keep it short, we went on a date over a year ago and I took her out to lunch at a Greek food festival. She arrived \~40mins late and had eaten a heap of pizza at home prior to coming and made herself sick, so she didn't eat anything and spent the date complaining how sick she was.

Anyway, the big event came last week when we went out after work for a drink together and she was showing me her 'Bumble' (online dating) account and saying she could never ""swipe right"" on anyone with conservative views, or anyone who looked ""too Anglo"". Ideally she wants a Greek boy in order to be culturally relatable, but then said ""white people have no culture"" which I personally think is quite harsh to say that neither the Australians or Irish have no culture.

Continuing with that night, she insisted to see my tinder profile and was swiping through on my behalf and came across a German girl and she said ""look, she's one of yours"". I was lost for a second, but then she whispered ""cause she's a nazi"".

Previously we'd opted to ban talking about politics as she often gets mad when I justify my beliefs, but now and then it's almost like she can't help herself and brings it up anyway.

In fairness, outside of politics we get along really well, but I feel like in this latest case it appears as though she has no respect for me given I am everything she seemingly dislikes - a white anglo and can't respect that I have different opinions in politics than her. We haven't spoken for a week, but I keep thinking, am I an asshole for considering cutting the friendship for this?"
749,ced9qy,"AITA for threatening to not allow my children to visit my parents alone if they don't stop trying to convert my children to Christianity? My wife and I are raising our children without religion. We've taught them it's a thing that exists and always answered questions about it as honestly and truthfully as possible ""They believe X... Etc."", but we don't want to push one on them and try to limit exposure outside of media and other people freely practicing. 

My parents are devout Christians and love our children just as much as we do. I can count on one hand the people I trust with my kids and they're on the list. 

However, they simply don't respect the boundaries my wife and I have set, assumedly because they believe they're saving my children from the eternal damnation they couldn't save me from. I feel their hearts are in the right place,  but the last time they visited for summer (we live in a different state from my parents) they came back speaking like we'd been raising them as Christians from birth. ""God says this and that"", etc.  

The most recent conversation went like this: 

""Why don't you believe in God, daddy?""

""Because he's not real sweetie.""

""But Grandma and Grandpa say he is!""


After this one I told my parents that if they keep doing this they won't get to see the kids without my or my wife's supervison. 

They told me I was being hateful and it was ""wrong to keep a grandchild from her grandparents just because you don't want them to hear about the Lord"".

Today was my day off and a co-worker called in, so my boss called me and asked if I could come in.
I said sure, why not. Unfortunately the new manager was the shift lead for the night, and we don't get along.i worked drive thru,my least favorite position. Today we were really busy, and I haven't gotten the opportunity to take a restroom break since I clocked in. I was starting to get irritable, I had not eaten, and customers were being rude due to high wait time. It's 3am, and the line was still long. I make an offhand comment on how people are being extra (keep in mind my headset was off and no customers would've heard me. He yells at me to calm down, despite him saying profanities and being aggressive, throwing empty containers (metal pans, wrappers, and even food) and overall looking like he's about to flip out on everyone. I take the headset and hand it to a co-worker, run to the bathroom and come back. I look at him and tell him I don't mind working but I will not be yelled at just because things aren't going his way. He said I better respect him and if I don't like it I can go home. I look him in the eye and ask him if he's gonna chill out or send me home. He insisted he could do whatever he wants.

We were discussing about how new people can come to the movie night crew and this somehow got onto the topic of future spouse coming into the movie night crew. The female friend stated that “the spouse would have to be voted in” and I answered with “We would have to vote in Karen’s husband?” (Fake name) she took offense and asked “why did you say Karen’s name and not mine?” And without thinking I told her I thought Karen would get married before her unintentionally referring that the female friend would be the last of us to get married.

752,dyb55b,"AITA for not letting my friend stay at my place on weekends so she can work? I own a 2 bedroom apartment and no roommates although my boyfriend is over most weekends. I sleep in the master and the other bedroom is used for storage and has a bed for an occasional visitor. I’m an introvert and couldn’t be happier with the setup. 

One of my friends, Shelley, lives in a city 45 minutes away. She has a Monday-Friday job but wants to make more money and found a weekend job in a city close to me. It’s an on call job where she would only go in when called and this could happen anytime day or night Saturday or Sunday and she’d have a small amount of time to commute. 

She knows I have an extra bedroom and asked if she could rent out that room on the weekends and pay me for it. I want to be able to help my friend if I can but I really don’t want to do this. I don’t want a roommate and that’s essentially what she would be. I’m not comfortable with someone coming and going all hours of the day or night and I want to be able to enjoy my weekends at my place with my boyfriend or other family and friends without someone always there. And I would hate to have to figure out arrangements if I ever wanted another visitor to stay in that room. Plus I want to be able to access that room whenever I want and not feel like I have to cater to her if she was sleeping. 

I told her I’d have to think about it and she went off on me saying how I’m being a bad friend and selfish since I have the bed anyway. The extra money from the job would help her and she doesn’t want to rent an apartment to only stay there on weekends. Plus I’d be getting paid and it’s only 2 days out of the week so what’s the problem? I said she’s asking a lot to come every weekend for an indefinite period of time and I need to think about it and she’d be coming in the only days I have off from work.

She said she had to go and we hung up and she sent a follow up text saying how hurt she is and she’s not asking a lot. 

Again I’m always willing to help my friends when I can and if she needed a place to crash for just 1 or 2 weekends, I’d be willing, but not for an indefinite period of time and I don’t want a roommate. But on the other hand, I do have the extra bed and I’d really be helping her out for the job, so I’m wondering AITA?"
753,c159v0,"AITA for joining social events, but not participating enough? I am a very introvert person, but I work ln a very socially competitive field (as an on-the-floor salesperson) and I've worked there long enough to where I consider several of my colleagues close friends.

We try to occasionally celebrate salary days, special holidays and other events.
I struggle a lot with various energy related issues that contribute a lot to my introvert nature (I'm still getting tested for cfs, but it's a long process when done thoroughly) so when I do go out, I legitimately want to go out with people I truly appreciate with the mindset of wanting to celebrate and have a good time.

 So once things get going i'm not exactly the first person to show off on the dancefloor, but once the group has a good time and everybody is loosening up, I'll join in. But occasionally people expect a lot more.

So what triggered me today is that a colleague of mine decided to bring a friend of his to our celebration because to paraphrase: ""kickstart the mood, since he's such a party guy.""

We got a couple of drinks, had fun, danced etc.

He started out as playfully active and fun, but once we got into an expensive venue and more alcohol got involved, I started to experience him more as a bully, he kept pushing us to play along and do things how he wanted, and drank everyone else's drink when they weren't present (despite some of us having financial struggles and only spending money because we want to have a good time with friends and colleagues), until he drank someone else's drink in front of their face and went ""oh sorry, I didn't mean to drink this blue drink, but this one"", which also wasn't his. Then I realized he drank most of my expensive drink that I had planned to have a good time with for most of the evening.
When I confronted I him about it I just got ""oh yeah, that one blue drink, sorry, I didn't mean that"" even though I literally saw and heard him go ""does anybody know who's this is? No? Then I guess it's mine."" a dozen times earlier. Of course my colleague went with his side of the story, since he'd been away on the dancefloor most the time and it's his friend. 

After this happened, I sat down for a couple of minutes and tried to understand happened, but shortly after, the friend outright tells me to leave because I'm ""bringing the mood down"", even though I was having an amazing time and dancing along, singing and partying untill that point and was already pushing myself above and beyond on a personal level.

I tried to tell my colleague that I felt like he was bullying me and trying to control me, but he didn't want to accept my experience of it even slightly, and the evening quickly fell apart.

All I wanted was to have some fun with people who are important to me, but I got no sympathy from my colleague.

Am I just lashing out or did I have justified reasons to be upset? Should I just soak it up and pretend like nothing for the sake of everyone else?

Should I just give up and find something else?"
754,cidw6d,"AITA for not helping my cousin out financially, despite her taking me in and helping raise me when I was a teenager? Some backstory, my dad ran away when I was a young kid, and my mom died when I was 15. Nobody else was willing to take me in, and I was about to go into the foster system, but my cousin ended up stepping up and taking me in. She was 24 and she was not exactly fit to raise a kid but she did as much as she could. I spent the next two years in her cramped apartment before I went to college, and while it wasn't perfect, it was better than nothing. Of course, I am extremely grateful to my cousin for this. 

Anyways, I went to college and got a relatively good job for a 23 year old. Not a great one, I don't make that much money. But my cousin had an even rougher time, she ended up dating an abusive guy and she quit her job when she got pregnant, only for the child to die soon after she gave birth. Her asshole boyfriend then left her after the kid died. Not only that, but she was burdened with medical bills. 

My aunt started a big charity thing to help her out (note, not her mom, another aunt). My aunt asked me to donate some money, and I put in 400 dollars. Just some context, I only had 1,200 dollars in my savings account. My aunt was pretty upset at the fact that I only put 400 dollars in the charity fund, saying that I lived in a nice apartment (I didn't, its in nyc but it isn't 'nice') and that I had a good job (again, not a good job, it just sounds fancy because its media related) and that I should put more in. She also said she noticed a lot of 'electronics' at my place which are likely worth a lot of money and that I could sell them to make money to give to my cousin (once again, not worth a lot of money, probably like 350 bucks max if I was to sell them). She said if it were her, and that if she was taken in by her as a teen, she would be giving as much money as possible to the charity fund. 

The thing is, there's already like 5,000 dollars in that fund. My cousins new apartments rent is 650 a month, and she has experience working and will likely get a new job soon, not to mention that my aunt and other family keep giving more money. I have a strong feeling that this doesn't have much to do with how much money I am putting in and more that my aunt views me as entitled and greedy. I mean I already put 1/3rd of my savings into the fund. I explained this to her and she just sort of acted like that doesn't matter. Then my uncle also came around and said the same thing basically. That she helped raised me, and I should do more. He said I was lazy and that I am selfish and don't want to help family out despite her being there for me. My uncle even said that maybe I should move from NYC, where my job is, to get a cheaper apartment to have more money to help her out. 

My cousin has barely said anything. She just thanked me for the 400 dollars and said we should get lunch sometime. That's it. This is entirely my aunt and uncle saying this stuff. But I can tell they are ranting a lot to everyone else in the family."
755,aivcsr,"AITA for not wanting to identify as gay? Hi everyone.

Before I start, let me just say that I am not trying to be homophobic/transphobic. I am incredibly new to this and it's very difficult for me to keep the hang of it. If i do make a mistake, please correct me. I want to learn. i don't know if my age has to do with anything but I am a sophomore in high school, I am 16.

So my current girlfriend came out to me as transgender the other day. She is now a boy and now my boyfriend. I am sorry if I use the wrong pronoun by mistake, I will try and read over and try and find if I make a mistake. Anyways we've been together for a little under a year now and I love him a lot. this is a lot for me to handle but I really support his transition and i am proud of him for being so brave to tell me. I love him literally with all my heart. if I could marry him right now I would, it doesn't matter that he is now a boy. But last night I actually had a weird thought: does this make me gay? because he is a boy and i am dating him.

So I brought this up with him today and he said yes I am gay. I was very confused because I have never liked guys before, and I still don't. I feel like this is a special case? Maybe it's not. I don't want to make him feel like he is any less of a boy just because he was born a girl, but I also don't really feel... gay. So he brought up the term bisexual, and I said no that isn't it either. I told him that I think I am straight, but I love him and he's an exception. He got very mad at me and wouldn't talk to me even after school. I've tried texting him but he won't respond, which is weird because almost every night we have really long text conversations.

Should I try and be gay for him? I don't think I could ever date a boy (other than him) and I am not sexually into guys like that. I am fine with gay people I just don't think I am one, or even bisexual. I really only have ever liked girls except for this one situation.

I don't want to leave him because I love him, but I don't want to identify as gay. He wants me to identify as gay, but I am straight, I think. I feel like he is an exception.

Am I being an asshole for not identifying as gay? Is it transphobic? I am sorry if it is.

Thanks for reading, I appreciate it.

I had a 97% average in her class and always aced the tests and did all my assignments, yet she still tried to find a way to pick on me or get me in trouble with my parents. I also had 5 assignments that I turned in (one of which she lost and it was a test grade) but she had 0’s put in the gradebook. (This will come up later)


Now, last week on Thursday during her class I was called down to the principals office for “selling weed to students”. This is a whole different story but basically I was accused of selling stuff over 3 months but they didn’t have enough evidence to expell me or take any action so I got off with a warning. (I know, it was stupid of me but all of this stuff happened a while ago.) 


When I got back to class, everyone was talking about it because they had known what happened (I have a reputation at school). My teacher overhears them talking about how I got in trouble with the AP and deputy so she approaches me and asks what happened. I didn’t feel comfortable with telling her because I didn’t want that to change her perspective on me and it’s none of her business anyways. I simply told her “It’s nothing.” and she didn’t like that. She got really upset and told me that she’ll figure it out. I didn’t really think anything of it.


The next day I walk in to class and go up to my teacher to talk about my grade as the grading period was ending the week after. I told her nicely that I had five 0’s for assignments that I turned in and to please fix the grades. She then randomly brings up what happened yesterday and starts to lecture me on how “I should have told her the truth” and how “I need to turn my life around”. Completely unnecessary. I simply said “This has nothing to do with my assignments"" because I really needed my grades to be fixed and I had been asking her for weeks to fix them but she never did. This really made her upset and she never fixed my grade.

758,ceqiw8,"AITA for putting my son's money in a bank account for him passive aggressively? I have a ten year old son, Ben. Ben just had his birthday which coincided with his graduation from elementary school. In honor of, my In-Laws threw him a party. Ben is one of those lucky kids who has money given to him by well-meaning adults. My husband and I started Ben his very own bank account. Ben is aware of his account and has access to his account through myself and my husband. If he wants something and can afford it, we go to the bank and he buys what he wants.

&#x200B;

My MIL found out about the bank account and it pissed her off. Apparently by taking the money she (or anyone) gives Ben it's disrespectful because by being in the bank it isn't being used for it's intended purpose. Basically it's like we're spitting in the giver's face. Recently my MIL had my son for the afternoon and she gave him three hundred dollars in cash and told him not to tell me or his daddy that she did, not to put it in the bank, to keep it somewhere and use it. My son was raised better than to hide things from me when he knows the reason is wrong so he told me about it when we got home that night. Apparently he felt guilty and he didn't feel like he could keep the money if he was lying to me. I'm very proud.

&#x200B;

I called my MIL and requested that she not tell my child to lie to me in future or I'd be cutting short her visits and time with my son. My MIL started some drama, called me some names, and told me I was a bad mother. Then she said next time she gives my son money to take him to the store and let him spend it, not put it in the bank, or we'd have some serious problems.

&#x200B;

It's a good idea to note my MIL hates me and I tried for a long time to change her mind without results. So now we just tolerate each other (badly).

&#x200B;

Everyone there knew it was also a b-day party so they gave him cash and gifts as well. My MIL gave me an envelope and told me it was a card and check for Ben, stuck her finger in my face and told me it better get spent on toys and games or, and I quote, ""I swear to God I'll call the cops on your trashy ass for theft."" I told her we were done, she wouldn't be seeing her grandson for a long time, and then we left. My husband was furious at her but thinks cutting her off from Ben isn't the right thing to do.

&#x200B;

Here's the AITA part: I put the check in Ben's bank account but didn't tell him it had been given to him, essentially removing his option to spend it. Since it was a check she was obviously notified of it's being deposited. I also sent her a note thanking her for the check and included the fact that it was deposited in Ben's account.

&#x200B;

AITA for this or am I justified? (I'm also considering posting this in r/parenting and r/JUSTNOMIL but I wanted the good opinion of this sub first!)

&#x200B;

ETA: Ben woke up about an hour ago and I sat him down while he ate breakfast and I explained to him that his g-ma gave him a lot of money but that she and mommy had a tiny disagreement over it at the party and mommy did something wrong and put the money in the bank without telling him about. I explained to him that sometimes when people fight their pride kicks in and instead of handling things like adults they decide to be petty and passive aggressive. I explained to him that mommy acted on pride and anger instead of thinking of Ben. I told him that they money was right there in the bank waiting for him to use it and in this one instance if he wanted to use all of it on a gaming system and games that I would totally allow that as part of my apology for keeping it from him. I apologized to him and told him that it was never okay for me to keep his money and presents from him. I told him that he was a good kid for coming to me when someone wanted him to lie to me and I should have given him the same courtesy. Ben was very understanding and forgiving and has made the very grown up decision to save his money up so he can buy a newer gaming system and better games. But he said he wants to take out some money to buy his mama something so I'm crying a little. He said it was flowers because I told the truth. I raised me a good one!"
759,c3w6ri,"AITA for using the same pot I boil my diva cup in, to cook? I’ve been dating this dude for 5 months. We get along well and everything is going great! - Or was, until today. 
 
I ended my period Friday, and boiled my diva cup this morning. I put it on about 10am (after my shower where I washed it). After, I turned the heat off, poured out the water, and left the pot on the burner so the cup would cool down before i put it away - to avoid burning my fingers.   
 

 I ended up forgetting about my cup.  (Not that I was trying to hide it from boyfriend anyways)
 
My boyfriend came over. First thing he does it goes to the kitchen to get something to drink. He took a while in the kitchen so I yelled at him to ask what he was doing. He yelled back “uh ... what’s in this pot?”. 
 
I explain and he just seems disgusted. He asked if I ever cooked him a meal in this pot and I said I wasn’t sure but probably. We go back and forth. I pull up the website to prove it says to boil the cup after use. He said that if a TP company told him to boil his toilet paper after use he’d just ignore it. He said I put him in danger by possibly contaminating his food with period blood ... mind you I clean the cup out before boiling! Boiling is just to kill bacteria, I guess?   
 
 
I can kind of see his point, but I don’t think boiling the cup contaminated the pot. I can’t find anything about it online either.
 
Anyways, AITA for not having a separate pot to boil my diva cup in? 
 
Edit: I also clean the pot after boiling. 
 
Edit: I’d also like to clarify that when the cup goes into the pot, it has no blood. It’s already been cleaned. Like it’s just clear silicon. I wanted to mention that because some people seem to imply otherwise. 
 
Edit: I’ve used all my smaller pots (2) to do this. Should I just toss them?"
760,c7v2z0,"AITA for cutting out my niece? i had to re 

I am in (female) mid 30’s, very sick, disabled, always in a lot of pain and suffer from anxiety and depression but doing ok with the right meds. A couple of years ago my estranged older brother told my 23 year old niece to get a hold of me since I wouldn’t talk to him. My sisters and I cut off contact with the rest of our family because they are extremely toxic. It turns out “Angie” wasn’t so bad and we became friends. Over the course of the months Angie began to change. She wasn’t the same funny, sweet girl I first talked to which is ok. I understand sometimes we need a friend to lean on but as time went on she became more and more dramatic, vain and very needy. She would call me and want me to be on the phone for hours then text me all day...repeat the process the next day and so on...if I didn’t answer Angie’s texts in a day she would flood me with more wanting to know why I’m not answering and if I was mad at her. Her sister on the other hand used to text me every now and then to say hello and chat for a little bit.

I’ve explained to her about me being sick several times and not always being up to talking as I sleep a lot. She said she understood but went back to her same routine right away. Even her dad had to tell her to quit bothering me so much but it fell on deaf ears. She suffers from depression and anxiety like I do so we kind of understand each other but whenever she’s texting me she’s stressing me out,  She really loves attention and starting fights with other people just for the drama. Then other times she’s asking me if I think she’s really pretty? She’s always putting herself down so I could contradict her when she sends me a ton of selfies. I’ve told her before she’s pretty and it’s hard for me to compliment someone on their looks because we weren’t brought up that way in our family. There are many more things she has done that made me want to knock some sense into her. I have had to tell her it’s a bad idea and she does it anyway and then complains why it went wrong.

This weekend I’ve reached my breaking point, I feel like I can’t continue living like this...with so much drama and negativity coming from her. She causes me so much stress even though I tell her to stop she just doesn’t listen.  It’s been a couple days since I’ve blocked her, now I feel bad because she used to tell me she has no one to talk to even though I kept encouraging her to make friends. They all seem to drop her. She’s seeing a therapist but Is that enough for her? Two years is my limit...So reddit, am I an asshole in this situation? Any advice?"
761,c0zthp,"WIBTA for being upset with my friend for telling people he saw me topless? A little bit of context, I’ve been friends with this guy since we were 11 and have no idea when he is claiming he saw me topless. We are all 16 ( Juniors in high school now). 

The other day I went to the mall with one of my friend, K, and we started talking about how are friend, T, who I’ve been friends with for a long time, is bugging her by interfering with her relationship. We go on to gossiping on why this is when she tells me that T told her he saw me topless in a lake when we were kids. 

I found this really odd considering he brought this up the last time we hung out, telling me how it was weird considering I didn’t have a chest at the time.I was kind of weirded out but forgot about it until K brought it up. It made me really uncomfortable that he was telling other people about it, especially since I have no memory of this incident. T also has the tendency to fabricate stories, coming up with outlandish stories about making out with girls in his uncles truck while they’re naked. I was worried that he would take this incident I don’t remember and make it seem like it was a real sexual experience. 

T has also done this kind of thing before, making an encounter of him sharing a blanket with a girl into a story about touching her boob. 

T and I have never been interested in each other. To put it softly I’m just not physically attracted to him, I thought he was someone I could talk to about relationship stuff and he could do the same for me. It makes me pretty uncomfortable that he’s telling other people that this happened and I’m scared he’ll say something about it. 

The other day he asked if K and I were pissed of at him. I told him I was uncomfortable about him telling people about the lake thing. He told me K was asking him weird questions so he brought it up, and since K and I weren’t upset at each other at the time it was okay. I still feel uncomfortable about the situation, but I don’t want to be the asshole by bringing this situation up if it really is nothing, especially since he has low self esteem due to being overweight.

Update: We had a conversation about it and after explaining to him why it was weird he finally apologized! Thanks for all the comments!
Update 2: So according to T the entire conversation started because K said she saw me naked, which never happened. I have no idea who is telling the truth and why they have anything to gain by talking about me naked."
762,cw7ua6,"AITA for wanting to break off/pause a 28 year friendship over growing appart so much? I have this once close friend I grew up with. Years sort of pulled us appart during adulthood, but we keep in touch once in a while.

The last few years have not been kind to him as a result of many bad life choices (Use of hard drugs, Drinking on the job, losing a dream job as a result, multiple DUIs, relationship issues, etc.).

About a year and a half ago, we got in touch and talked about rehabilitation. He was doing well until a few weeks ago when he reached out to me about a relationship he's been wanting to get out of but not sure how to do it. No sex, emotions are all gone, feels like a living arrangement, etc. We talked about life and basically what he wants out of it, because we all make choices. The next day he broke up with her and assured me he had a place to crash (I had offered my place).

2 weeks ago he called me saying 'if anyone tries to reach you, I was at your place ok?'. I questionned the whole situation (because tendencies to make bad life choices... imo) and he confessed he was about to cheat on his GF and his alibi is to be me. He was also piss drunk and it was noon. So I declined and told him a piece of my mind about how unethical this whole thing is, but also how he's back to square one: a relationship he wants out of. I didn't question the booze given he's lied to me so many times in the past about this. I wouldn't expect that topic to go well as it not once has.

A couple days ago he sent me a text for a casual conversation, to which I didn't reply. I've noticed a trend with these talks and I often end up feeling guilty of thinking I'm the one who's letting this friendship go.  So I make plans which often fall appart because he gives a reason to cancel. I feel some of these are made up.

Anyway, today he's asking me why I'm not replying. This is via messenger which tells him confirmation I saw his messages.

I'm not sure what to do but I realise I'm tired of this friendship. We grew appart so much, I'm not the same person I was back then and I realise he's not good for me in the long run given he's got a knack for manipulative conversations and using people.

On my end, I'm progressing in my own long term life issues and this last half-year has been great for me.

We have our history and I feel I have some faults into why we're where we're at given there were times I should have been there for him and just wasn't. But at the same time I know stringing him along can result in my personnal progress slowing down or even going backwards.

I don't like this, but am I an asshole for wanting to reply and telling him I'm not interested in a friendship with him until he gets his shit together?

I've known him for 28 years and I fear for his life in the long run.

Sorry if I didn't respect this sub's rules, I'm not very familiar with it."
763,c2upd8,"AITA for wanting to go to bed early on a trip abroad with friends? My friends are party animals, they could probably stay up all night and be fine in the morning. I, on the other hand, cannot do that. I need my sleep, and introvert me needs time away from draining social situations. Travel also makes me super sleepy.

Last night at our resort my friends declared that they were going to go night swimming. Since it was midnight, I decided that I would really rather get my full night’s sleep so I could fully enjoy whatever we did in the morning. My friends were not happy about that. They called me a party pooper, said I was being selfish, and said if I didn’t come they’d push me in anyway.

Gail is emotionally abusive. I lived with her since I was 13 till I was 18. I moved out as soon as I could. I won’t dive into what she did to me, but I will say that because of her during my later years of high school I struggled with a panic disorder, severe depression, etc. Now I am currently being treated for bipolar depression and anxiety. Gail being the underlying cause of it all. 


Am I the asshole for not caring about her cancer coming back? She’s been struggling and going through hell. But I just can’t get myself to care about her. She put me through hell for years and had I not had my best friend at the time, I would have gone through with “it”.

765,be4alx,"AITA for refusing to refund money on an item I sold on Facebook marketplace?  

Last weekend, I posted a trampoline for $75 on Facebook marketplace. It was in great shape with the safety net included. I got an offer for $50 and took it just to get it out of my yard. 

My partner and I had the trampoline mostly taken apart by the time the man arrived. He asked if we had all components and springs to which we said yes. All of the pieces were there and intact before we took it apart. We offered to count the springs out for him, but he seemed in a hurry and just started boarding everything into his truck. I checked the yard for any missing pieces before he left. 

Today I got a message from the buyer saying, “You didn’t tell me there was a missing spring.” I messaged back that all of the springs should be there, but that I’d check the yard. I looked around for it and couldn’t find it. My yard is very small so I would be able to spot it easily if it were here. 

I messaged that I couldn’t find the spring. I explained that everything was there before we took the trampoline apart and asked did he double-check his truck bed & the box? He replies back that I was dishonest about the sell & he’s driving down to get his money back. I sent, “I’m sorry, but I will not be doing that. All pieces were there when we took it apart. I even offered to count the springs for you. You had every chance to check and/or back out of the sale.” 

Well, now he’s pissed. He’s demanding I give the money back and soiling my name on local Facebook groups. I don’t want to refund him because I feel like he may have lost the piece on his own. AITA?

Edit: Thanks for the perspective Reddit! I've decided against giving money back and I will NOT be buying a replacement. He got $25 knocked off listing price so he can easily buy one for $3 as some of you pointed out. I don't have any intentions on selling through marketplace again after this ordeal."

She doesn’t call even though I have a phone and I don’t answer usually because I just think it’s rude for her to show up unannounced although sometimes I’m legitimately doing something which makes it even more frustrating. I like my privacy and feel like she sees me as a child not deserving of privacy or a notice of her coming. When I do let her in, she can be extremely rude and disrespectful. She’ll often call me shy and say things about how I don’t leave the house often, which I hate. She’s also an emotional vampire where she’ll only talk about negative things that happened to her for sympathy. It all got worse actually because she got really mad I wouldn’t let her in this weekend. She did the usual routine of insulting me, calling me shy, asking what I do all day, saying she doesn’t like my hair.

767,drdykq,"AITA for refusing to shift seats in a movie theatre? We went to a 9:30pm movie last night… a group of 4 of us… me, my girlfriend, girlfriend’s friend and her new boyfriend. This was after a very pleasant dinner after meeting this guy (for the first time).

We got to the movie relatively early, around 9pm… the theatre was maybe ⅓ full… we picked some excellent seats in the middle of a good row and kept chatting. All good.

The theatre kept filling up, and was probably ¾ full by the time it got dark and the previews began. There were 15 minutes of previews as usual, and during that, the last-minute crowd trickled in… you know, scrounging for seats in the dark.

As it turned out, given the way people had arrived after us and sat, our group of 4 had single, empty seats on either side of us. A simplified seating chart reading from the aisle inward, left-to-right, would be: occupied, occupied, empty, me, gf, gf’s friend, new bf, empty, occupied, occupied 

And a whole 17-minutes after 9:30, as the actual movie was beginning, a couple showed up in the aisle and hoarsely whispered, asking if the seat next to me was empty, and was the one 4 seats away also empty, and if so, would we mind shifting over.

Not sure how relevant any of the following is, but I’ll state it before I state what happened:

\- they were carrying popcorn and drinks… not like they came running in late

\- the first three rows of the theatre were effectively empty

\- our row had two empty seats together, but on the other side of the aisle, ie bad-angle side view

\- there were probably other pairs of seats behind us as well, but not as prime seating as our row

All that being the case, and me not ever being a fan of anyone who thinks they can saunter in at the last minute (or even beyond it), simply said no. There are plenty of seats everywhere else and we’re settled in with jackets hung and whatever, and don’t feel like causing a disturbance. Guy gets a little rattled and there’s a bit of back and forth angry whispering.

And then new bf (4 seats away) gets involved and asks me what my problem is, it’s not a big deal…. and moves to sit next to me, leaving two open seats where he used to be, so the couples sit there.

OK, whatever. 

After the movie, and long after that couple had left, I got into it with the new bf and his gf… he calling me an asshole, she upset she didn’t get to sit next to the guy.

There you go, AITA? I’m not sure what difference it would make if they came running in last minute and/or the theatre was totally packed and/or it wasn’t after the actual movie had begun… but there are all the facts for your consideration."
768,dl6zob,"AITA for wanting my husband to have a different doctor? My husband Dan has cancer. They caught it early and treatment is going well but he's quite weak and his trips to the hospital are frequent. Recently he received a letter asking him to another hospital to meet a specialist oncologist who will be dealing with him. As soon as I saw the name I got a fright. I assumed it was just the same name but no such luck. I googled it and it was definitely her. 

I'll call her Freya for this. I knew her years ago. She was an awful spoiled psycho. She and her friends hated me and going to school was like war and there wasn't anywhere I could go where they couldn't find me. She made me think I was ugly and worthless and unloveable and I still have confidence issues because of it. She managed to paint me as the bad guy, making everyone including teachers think that I was bullying her for being prettier than me. Worst of all she got me kicked out of school. She smoked a weed joint in front of everyone and tried to burn my face with it, and I flipped out on her and had to be pulled off. Normally I would have just got punished with a isolation or detentions or whatever but this was over 20 years ago when certain parents could pull strings, and hers made sure I was kicked out (and one of my teachers said this himself and was deeply apologetic that I had to go). I was never amazingly smart like her but that had a huge effect on my education and set me back. I do have a career now but it took a while to get there. 

I did a bit of googling and apparently she's one of the best in her field in the country, an expert with an excellent track record. We did ask one of the nurses if it was possible for someone else to deal with him, and were told that while it was possible, we're incredibly lucky to be having someone of that skill level dealing with it and that Dan really was in the best possible hands. 

So we went to the hosp. I can't fault her competence or capability but she was incredibly cold and unfriendly towards us and seemed to having fun making us uncomfortable, outright telling us she couldn't be bothered with the meeting and would rather be at home watching TV. She also mentioned that Dan's treatments would make him very weak and that he would lose weight, and then once sentence later started talking about her husband and how ''strong and protective'' he is. We were both very uncomfortable but didn't say anything. 

Dan and I ended up arguing when we got home, about how I can't stand seeing her or the thought of her vile hands all over him, or the thought of her ever being in the same room as our children. He knows all about how she treated me years ago and sympathises, but understandably wants the best possible care which unfortunately is Freya. I feel like an awful person for wanting my husband to have someone treat him who may not be as skilled as her, but at the same time the thought of having her back in my life makes me want to cry as I remember everything she did."
769,dwg9lb,"AITA for leaving a decoy test in public to deter cheating? I work in a university as an associate professor. 

Last year for this course I am teaching, one of my students stole a midterm before it was issued. They asked the secretary to open my door because they left something in there when they spoke to me, and he or she snooped through my things and found the exam. I noticed right away and had to write a new exam (this takes me approximately 10 hours). The fate of the secretary is not important but I can say a lot of people failed that exam because presumably they studied only the (wrong) exam.

This year I decided to play a joke/trick on my students. I purposefully left a (wrong) exam in one of the computer labs. I did tell my students earlier in the semester of what happened last year, so maybe they get the hint that cheating doesn't win. I teach a first year course so this is a good learning experience: if you cheat, you lose. If a student found my (wrong) exam, shared it around, and people studied for only that exam, they deserve to fail.

So I (25m, Irish) and living in Ireland. I just started dating a Polish girl (26,f) and we were in bed in her house this morning chilling. I was texting my best friend (25m Polish) about girl problems he's having, while also getting the girl's input and bringing her into the conversation.

It was all going well until she took my phone and sent a voice message in Polish to the guy, to which he responds ""wow""....
When I asked her what she said, she just said ""oh I asked him could he stop talking to us because we have fun things we wanna do and he's interrupting"". 
She starts smiling and I tell her that's not funny, it's actually extremely rude. She said she was joking and I said she was obviously serious but wanted to thinly veil the comment. She got angry at me for being too serious but I told her that she's never met my best friend (as we've literally just started dating) and that she doesn't know him and that what she said was rude. She also didn't ask me could she take my phone and send the message. I wasn't mad or angry, just being very serious.

Then I explained how me and him have been friends for 13 years and that if my best friend and my girlfriend didn't get along, that one of them would have to go... And it wouldn't be him. So then I told her I was going to go, she apologized and I accepted it but left anyway because I was going to the gym either way. 

She texted me again to say she's sorry and while I do believe her, I just feel like she's sort of ruined it now. If my friend goes off and tells other friends what she's done, none of them will like her and it'll all be over. He accepted her apology and said it was good of her to admit her mistake but I'm still on the fence about whether or not I've fully forgiven her for ruining his first impression of her (and potentially all my other friend's impressions too). Also I'm wondering if this is a serious red flag or not for the potential relationship. Help me out, is this a red flag or should I just get over it because everyone has apologised and accepted it?

771,eakjk3,"AITA for leaking conversations with my ex? So we were friends and part of the same friend group for a while before we started dating, took off great, ended really badly. She was really emotionally abusive and would constantly have double standards when it came to what was acceptable behavior (I had to be normal, but also had to accept the fact that she wasn't normal for example).

Anyways when we broke up I left out friend group voluntarily and she stayed in. People asked what happened between us and why I left and she started badmouthing me, saying that I was a little bitch who couldn't take the heat she was dishing out and that I needed to man up and other just really...things that angered me.

So what I ended up doing was sending a group text with audio, video, and text interactions with her from when we dated that I'd been documenting in case things turned physical and I needed to call the cops (thankfully never did). Since then things have blown up. I've suffered tremendous reputation damage, but she took an even bigger hit.

My closer friends throughout this ordeal stuck by me but I probably could've kept them regardless of whether or not i sent that group text. As far as I know everyone in the friend group is disgusted by her. She hasn't contacted me.

Since I didn't get anything from this except that I felt a lot better (like I got a lot of emotional baggage off my chest), thought I can't shake off the feeling that I was wondering if I'm the asshole here.

Whatever the verdict, I'm going to defend my actions in the sense that they made *me* feel a lot better, however."
772,aa82yt,"WIBTA for asking my ex to get checked for chronic traumatic brain injury? My ex played soccer in college and all through elementary and middle school. Fun fact but women's soccer is actually the sport most prone to concussions, not american football.

I was my ex's first intimate relationship, but im a few years older than her, so I have had my fair share of ex-es that could be considered crazy. Like half the posts in this sub could be them. This girl had all negative stuff of my past, more ""normal"", relationships -- the yelling, the passive aggressiveness, the shittalking to friends during fights (girls tend to do this during fights more than guys). It also had some of the crazier stuff I've already been through too --- the pathological lies, the suicidal threats, the cheating etc. This is all stuff that may or may not happen in a relationship but is not necessarily a sign of brain injury.

What made this relationship different tho is the way this girl would argue. Of all the things, it was her thought processes during arguments that set off alarm bells in my brain. It wasnt crazy like in an emotionally-sporadic way, it was crazy in like a psychotic-delusional way. She would legit take everything I said and twist it into the worst way possible, but it was in ways that made no logical sense whatsoever. It got to the point where just as a test I could literally agree with everything she was saying and she would still twist my words to keep the fight going somehow. I'm telling you, it was like the words that came out of my mouth were not processed on the other end, like she couldnt fathom on a cognitive level what was happening. And it got to the point where some days i would basically just sit and watch her argue with herself, where I would seriously wonder if there was any possible thing I could say (even if it wasnt how i truly felt) to get her out of this mood. 

When she moved out (after a big fight where that strategy I'd been using went horribly wrong) she spread a bunch of rumors about me that weren't true. I mean that sucked but it does seem like something that happens in relationships occasionally. What made this different was that her dad actually reached out to me to say that she ""wasnt the same person anymore"" and that he hadnt talked to her in 3 months. So yea, all that stuff about the suicidal partner was happening here -- I couldnt defend myself to my friends and even my family (she reached out to them too with her weird manipulative delusions) without risking her offing herself. I guess that's not relevant tho.

A CT scan wont diagnose CTE by itself, but it could be really, really useful 3 years from now to show that the brain has changed over time. That's cause CTE is a degenerative disease.

I'm wondering how I can bring this up without her thinking I'm trying to antagonize her somehow...? I really feel like i care about her a lot as a friend and I am worried about her brain cause she's smart af too...  I doubt I could even show her this thread without her assuming the worst in me. But it would be worse if she somehow thought I was being clingy or like I want to get back together.

I waited a few months and we had our first friendly convo yesterday so now is a good time I think.... 

A lot of the threads in this sub are about ""how you say it"" not ""what you say"". I think this is the most precarious ""how you say it"" situation possible because it is a legit crazy  person here and i dont know what to do."

My neighbor asked me at the start of summer to drive her granddaughter back and forth to school. This isn't an issue as I have kids at the same school. She offered 25 a week which covers half a tank of gas. Cool.

While drunk and talking about how she has to be primary caregiver, she told me she couldn't do after school care or homework, and just all out complained about how she now has to be mom instead of grandma and she's too old.  So I offered to help the girl with homework and watch her after school for an extra 25. So I'd be making 50 a week watching her kid 3hrs a day after school and driving her to and from. I low balled because I know the grandma is on disability and works a part time job so I wasn't trying to put her out. Especially since childcare around here is 75+ a week and doesn't cover half days or holidays. 

I watched the girl for a few hours the week before school and got paid 25. Sweet.

First week the girl only went two days and I got paid 35. I figured it was because of lack of days, so no worries. 
This week, I haven't been paid. The granddaughter has stayed over every day except 2 and I've been helping her with homework and she's been playing with my children and just loves being over and having friends. 
Today the grandma tells me she'll send me the 25 and I say 50. 

She tells me we never agreed to 50 and I reminded her of the conversation we had. How she said she was unable to be a mom to the granddaughter, how she didn't know how to help her with homework and how lonely the granddaughter had been over the summer. The grandma says for that price she can just sign the granddaughter up for the boys and girls club. I say okay fine. 
I did offer to continue driving her back and forth for the previous agreed on 25 but now the granddaughter will not be coming over for 3 hrs to play and do homework.

776,cw2f6f,"AITA for telling my in-laws that it was disrespectful to leave half used toiletries as a “gift” for our hotel room cleaner? Had a family holiday and stayed at a hotel for 2 weeks, at the end of our stay we still had some half used toiletries left and didn’t want to take them back home with us since we were running short for space in our luggage. 

The in-laws wanted to leave the half used toiletries like soap, shampoo, conditioner, and unfinished packets of makeup wipes, facial tissues etc. in a little hamper basket with a card to say thanks for cleaning up the room during our stay. 

I totally understand where they’re coming from about not wanting to waste stuff and they thought it was a good gesture but I just don’t think it’s right to dress it all up like that when they’re half used and unwanted. 

I don’t know if it makes sense to you but to me, it seems like they’re valuing the cleaner below themselves, like, you wouldn’t gift half used toiletries to your family or friends so why would you do it to a cleaner? Wouldn’t it have been better to just leave them there instead? It almost seems like they have to make it nice because they think that’s all the cleaner can afford or something, I would be insulted if I was the cleaner :(

The only reason why they’re “gifting” it is because it’s unwanted, and if we had none left then they wouldn’t have bothered leaving new gifts anyway. 

I told them I don’t have a problem with them leaving the stuff but maybe they shouldn’t have put it in a hamper and added a card, also to me it felt like they assumed that said cleaner can’t afford their own toiletries just because they are a cleaner. 

If the cleaners wanted to take the stuff then they could have done so if we just left it neatly arranged by the sink or something, we left food in the fridge freezer like an unopened packet of ham that we didn’t eat and a soft taco kit on the counter. 

Obviously I wasn’t going to throw away the basket and card because they paid for it all and made it look nice so we left it where it was and went on our way, but told them I did disagree with the way they went about it and how the cleaner could be offended. 

I have since apologised as I felt a little bad about shutting them down straight away when they probably put some thought into it. But I still stand my my original opinion. 

My point in short it that I think it’s disrespectful to “gift” half used toiletries to a cleaner because you wouldn’t do the same for friends or family and the cleaner might be insulted if they’re being given them because (1) they’re unwanted and (2) just because they clean hotel rooms doesn’t mean they can’t afford their own toiletries

I’ve just reached the tunnel of the mini Torii gates, we come across a girl getting her photo taken and we hear her yell out of nowhere “you got to tell them move out the frame bitch.” This comment wasn’t directed at us, so we just keep walking past her. We stop about 30 gates down, which is pretty good size distance to take our own photos.

&#x200B;

During this time, we’re just patiently waiting to hope to get a clearing for two seconds of no tourists for a shot of the gates that you’ve probably seen all over Instagram.

&#x200B;

As were waiting around, this same girl keeps yelling at people multiple times. She’s yelling “one way, one way”. Because people are walking up the tunnel the wrong way and they’re ruining people’s photos. You must remember though; this is basically Disneyland style tourist attraction. There are hundreds if not thousands of people exploring the shrine.

&#x200B;

We then overhear her complaining to her friends that they’ve been waiting for us for 10 mins to move multiple times. We are also just waiting around to hope to get a clearing. People are also of course in front of us further down the gates doing the same, waiting.

&#x200B;

Out of nowhere, I hear her yell “Move you’re in everyone’s shot! Move! Move!” I keep hearing her repeat this, so I turn around and sure enough she’s talking to me. Suddenly of out nowhere there’s a guy a group effort blockade to temporarily block traffic so people can take this famous shot.

&#x200B;

I was like I’m also waiting to get a shot and she just continues to yell “Move! Move!” so I yelled back “Stop being such a bitch” of course she reacted with a “Stop being a asshole” and again I was like “You’re being a bitch” and walked away.

&#x200B;

Part Two

About 15 minutes later, I’m still at the shrine a more open area. She finds me and approaches me with her phone recording alongside her Mom and perhaps boyfriend/bother?

&#x200B;

From here she starts yelling 10-20x times “So what did you call me”. I calmly waited and asked if I could talk. I first explained to her; she was being extremely rude to everyone. Yelling at them. Followed by an apology of my outburst. To which she said “But I wasn’t yelling at you, who cares” I said I was still upset. Then she comments “there’s assholes everywhere, what are you going to do”. I explained to her it was obviously super busy time and that she didn’t need to yell at people. I think she stopped recording and started making statements such as “I was being rude so what? I know I was being rude”

&#x200B;

I make the comment and ask if she enjoys being rude? She said “no” then tangents off topic a bit. Finally, my girlfriend apologizes to her mother and they walk away.

&#x200B;

AITA?

778,bhw805,"AITA for moving away for a job after my boyfriend asked me to marry him? I (24F) am about a week away from moving away from my boyfriend (29M) who I have had my longest relationship yet and previously lived with. I have a lot of mixed emotions.

There were 3 points in our relationship where I actually wanted and could envision marrying him and having children with him. We were on the same page for the important things for the future. However, my feelings came and left because of the trust issues, so I decided to accept a job offer this spring where I will be moving abroad. When we got together again this last fall before the job offer, he drunkingly asked me on two occasions to marry him. I said no both times because he was drunk. He asked a third time soberly, but without a ring and knowing about me taking the job. I hope that I am not sounding like a gold digger here, but I really couldn't take him seriously and felt hurt. He had the whole relationship to ask, and I would have said yes at earlier points and not be moving right now. I said no for the last time, but I am having many ""what if"" thoughts...

AITA for not taking him seriously?

Also, we agreed not to do long distance. He flat out told me that he couldn't have sexual fidelity, and I am not open to an open relationship. Although I am leaving, we have stayed/are still together. I have told him that I don't understand why he has insisted on it because we live in a metropolitan area with a lot of singles. He said why would he look for someone else if I was still here? I love him and haven't moved on yet, and I feel like I am a selfish asshole for agreeing to it. He has already brought up being friends once I move, and I want to, but I am still in love with him and want time to get over him.

AITA for not wanting to be friends with him right away?

Edit: sorry, will go blow up r/relationships"
779,cys9hn,"AITA for not wanting anything to do with a film I was in? I’m an independent filmmaker, nothing too impressive, mostly little guerrilla comps here and there. 

A few years ago my friend asked me to star in a feature he was making. The film is about a woman whose being spied on so it would require some pretty invasive stuff including some nudity. 

I agreed to do the movie when the writer/director promised me that I would get to see all the footage first and I would get final say in what goes in the film. If I wasn’t comfortable with something it would be cut no questions asked. He also promised that it would never be screened in our hometown and that he wouldn’t show it to anyone without clearing it with me first. 

The promise that I could have final say in what’s goes in the movie made me more comfortable to push the limit and let him film some pretty edgy stuff. 

Things started going to shit almost immediately. If people want specifics about the drama I can include it but the TLDR is that the shoot was a terrible time. We were all miserable and some people even walked off the set and refused to return. A good friend of mine said this experience almost ruined film for him all together. 

A few months later we had to film some scenes at a different location and the director didn’t send up the updated scripts until we were on our way to the location. When I and my scene partner felt like we weren’t getting it we asked for a week to rehearse and this pissed off the director. 
Suddenly I’m being treated like a moody diva. Another friend of mine even invited me to go to Comic-Con with him which I quickly found out was just so he could get me in the car for a long time and convince me to finish the movie. 

Around this time I found out that people were watching footage left and right that I did not clear and I had even gotten some comments about my nude scenes. 

Later the director asked to meet with some of us at a restaurant and pulled out his laptop to show us some footage. I got upset because if he accidentally clicked on the wrong place it was my naked body that would be displayed to anyone around. 

I was again treated like a drama queen. 

The movie is now finished and they’re making Facebook pages, even screened it at a local film festival and keep messaging me about how great it all is and asking me to like the pages, share with people. 

At this point I just want to be done. The promises made to me were broken and I understand that there’s nothing I can do about it so I just want them to fuck off

I felt like I’m in the right to the point that I was afraid this would come across as a validation post but so many of my friends think I’m the asshole and should just support my friends and be understanding of the mistakes that were made. AITA?

Edit: these comments are really eye-opening. I was feeling guilty for slightly sticking up for myself and not wanting to be involved anymore when rational people are talking about contracts and possibly suing. I’m not going to sue but I should be more confident in standing up for myself and that expecting someone to follow through on their promises"
780,axn7hf,"AITA for kicking someone from my game? I was hosting a game of Stardew Valley Co-Op and was inviting players from the public discord. Things were going well until I got this one player who immediately asked if there were any girls on the server. One of the players responded in the affirmative and he immediately started hitting on her. He did nothing else besides that. Followed her around the game talking to her, asking her where she lived and other personal questions.

I told him to stop and just play the game as he was contributing nothing to the game and, to be honest with you, he was kind of creeping me out a little. I told him his actions were inappropriate and that he needed to stop. He ignored me and kept at it. So I kicked him from the game.

What makes me think ITA is that the other two players, including the girl he was bothering, immediately left my game after that. They all got to talking on the public discord which we were all members of and agreed to play a game without me. Was I in the wrong?"
781,eix7wc,"AITA for not accepting an apology while a person is going through a breakup? Sorry for any grammatical errors but English isn't my first language.

To give a bit of background . In highschool we had a trio of friends which included myself , Alexa and Siri (names changed). Siri was planning to go on a vacation for a few weeks out of state and I thought it was a perfect opportunity to spend some time alone with Alexa. You see I had this huge crush on Alexa and like typical high school love stories I asked her out and she declined me. She then went on and started publicly humiliating me for how stupid I was to ask her out. She started ostracizing me from parties and from my friends circle since she was quite a popular girl. Basically my social life went to shit after that ordeal. I locked myself in my room and cried for days and begged her to stop but she didn't. When Siri came back she saw the whole fiasco happening at high school and reprimanded Alexa for what she did. Helped a lot with dealing with my broken heart, God bless her soul. 

Years later I realized that Siri was the one I truly love, asked her out, dated for a few years and we are now engaged. Altho I have completely broken contact with Alexa, keep in mind that Siri is still quite close friends with Alexa. Cannot deny that some part of me wants Siri to not be friends with Alexa, but it's her choice and I respect that.

This new year's Eve I was tired of going anywhere and Siri was going to spend the night with her parents . I thought it was a good idea to spend this NYE alone. I get a call from Siri at around 21.30 that I need to pick her up ASAP and we need to drive to Alexa's bf place. I was half asleep but agreed to do in the heat of moment. 

Apparently Alexa caught her bf sleeping with a girl and was on the streets and called Siri to help her as she couldn't go back to her place and needed someone to talk to. I was apprised of this along the way and I didn't think much about it as I too, was concerned for her safety. We picked her up, she was an emotional mess at this point, and Alexa started opening up about her relationship and how she trusted her bf... Typical after breakup stuff. 

Now this is the part , where I think I may the the Assh*ole. In her emotional vulnerable state she asked me if I forgave her for what she did all those years back. I wasn't ready for this question , the past still haunts me as I still struggle with the PTSD of the whole incident. I politely but firmly replied ""I do not accept your apology but forgive you for what you did"". I thought it was a pretty reasonable response. My fiance Siri was quite upset with me saying that the least I could do was accept her apology as she needed to hear that at that moment. So Reddit, AITA?"
782,b4f3og,AITA for returning my ex’s love ring and purse? So I had bought my ex girlfriend a Cartier love ring and and Chloe bag for her birthday as gifts and gave them to her. Quite expensive gifts for an average dude like myself. A week later I discover she’s been texting with an old friend of hers calling him the love of her life. I broke up with her and returned the gifts I had gotten her for her bday after finding out. AITA? 
783,eedx9x,"WIBTA if I refused to share the cost from a car accident during a road trip I was on? So this summer a longtime friend of mine and I rented a car to go on a road trip. We split the driving, but my friend pushed to be the driver more often than not. When it was time to return the car to the airport in the dead of night, I was under the impression that she was tired, so I offered to drive. However she insisted on driving and managed the (short) drive without issue.

Then, when parking the car on the almost entirely empty lot, she decided to park her car right in between two other cars. I warned her to take one of the free spots instead of this narrow one, but she ignored this and hit a parked SUV.
She received a bill for ~4,500$ in the mail some days back and has made a polite remark about expecting me to share this cost. Neither me nor my friend are particularly wealthy, but the cost isn't going to hurt either of us heavily.

I would not hesitate to split the cost if the accident had been caused by something outside of her control or a light mistake that could have happened to anyone. However I feel this damage was solely due to my friend behaving recklessly and outright ignoring multiple warnings.

WIBTA if I don't offer to help with the bill?
WIBTA if I refused to if my friend insists?"
784,az8en3,"WIBTA if I told on a coworker So I (18M) work at a call center for a medical clinic. Today, I was sitting with two of my coworkers discussing work and the topic shifted to some other business ventures the company has made. One of them (40’s F) said “these Jews just want to make money”, in reference to the two owners, who are both Jewish and pretty well renowned in their field of medicine. While I am Jewish, I’m not very threatened or offended by this, however I feel somewhat compelled to not let this slide.

My questions is, would it be the right thing to speak to a manager about this, exposing myself as the one who told and potentially getting her in trouble, or letting it slide as an offhand comment? For context as well, I have been there 8 months and she is relatively new, so 3-4 months. She has also made many nagging comments about coworkers, patients and managers. "
785,c95tnj,"AITA for not apologizing to a (fellow) disabled person? I am a person with a serious hearing impairment, where I have no hearing at all on one side and extremely limited hearing on the other (less than 10%) I get by mostly by reading lips, captions, and sign language when someone knows it. My speech isn’t very impacted, which means you might interact with me and have no idea I’m disabled. 

So yesterday I was walking on the sidewalk, someone walking past me kind of motioned for me to move aside. I looked behind me and saw a person in a motorized wheelchair was trying to get around me. So I moved over, but the person in the chair was really angry with me and yelled that they had been trying to get past me for the last block. I really didn’t hear them so I shrugged and said that I’m deaf and didn’t hear them. 

They yelled at me “that’s convenient” - implying I’m not actually deaf but was making an excuse. I kind of laughed and said “actually it’s not”. They kept freaking out about how I was able bodied and need to get out of the way when someone needs space. I ended up just shrugging and walking away. 

Now my friends are saying I should have apologized when I saw I was in that person’s way. I really don’t think I needed to, I moved the moment I realized they needed to get by, and I couldn’t hear them prior to that. My friends are saying that I should have apologized because that person was more disabled than me. I think the whole thing is stupid and I don’t owe anyone an apology over this one. AITA?"
786,ay5yf5,"AITA for asking my boyfriend to stop paying his ex “alimony” Okay, I really need an outside point of view on this because I’m too emotional to think straight. My boyfriend split up with his now-ex in May 2018. They both had agreed to an open relationship in the beginning of 2018 (i met him in March) and in May they decided to officially split and she moved across the country. 

After a few months of dating (around June/July), he began spending 100% of his time at my place. He still has his own place and lease, and his place costs about half of what mine does per month. I make more than he does, but not significantly more. He always said he had trouble paying bills (in fact I’ve leant him money for this, some of which he still hasn’t paid back), so I never asked him to chip in for any expenses. We take turns paying on the rare occasion we go out on a date.

Today I learned that he’s been sending his ex hundreds of dollars per month. Every month. Anywhere from $100-250 per week. I’m PISSED and demanded he stop - he literally **borrowed money from me to give to her.**

Now here’s where I may be the asshole. They were still doing the “open relationship” thing through April, and they found out she was pregnant just before she moved away. This was before we were exclusive, so while it sucks, it wasn’t a cheating issue. The child was born at the end of December, and they have not gone to court or filed anything about child support (which is now pretty evident why). 

I told him that he (1) needs to sort it out in court, and (2) until then, he can and should  pay for everything for that child that she sends him a receipt for. However, no more paying for her hair (she gets it done extravagantly in rainbow colors, definitely not a home-done thing), her clothes, and everything else in her lifestyle that she loves to brag about on Facebook. Supporting the kid is fine, but ZERO money to her. 

He thinks I’m being unreasonable and that he owes it to her and her (not his) 11 year old son from a previous relationship to keep funding whatever they want, although he’s at least admitted that he shouldn’t have borrowed money from me for “bills” to send to her. 

AITA for putting my foot down and forbidding him to send any more money that’s not baby-related?

Edit: I’m trying to put all the info in and I feel like it’s unfair that I left this part out. Her kid from a prior relationship calls my boyfriend dad - they were together for about 6 years so more than half of his life. Boyfriend is insisting it’s to help with rent and stuff the older child needs and that he can’t help what she decides to spend it on. 

2nd edit: since he knew splitting up put her in a financial bind (she’s never worked, no medical/disability reason, she says it’s to take care of her 1st kid who’s in grade school ) he’s been paying her $300/mo car payment and has kept her on his cell phone plan. She was supposed to put it in her name when she was financially able but hasn’t. This part I knew about if it matters. "
787,ejvk57,"AITA for not really acknowledging my father’s older sons? TL;DR: my much older half-brothers who I barely know have never made a solid attempt to be part of mine or my younger brother’s lives, aita for basically not considering them family?

Both of my parents were married multiple times with multiple children and my only full sibling and I(22F) (who we’ll call James(20M)) are from their final marriages.

My dad has 2 older sons (John and Joe) from his first wife who I’ve met a handful a times and who are quite a bit older than either of us (at least 12 years)

They lived with us (James, my parents and I) briefly when I was too young to remember but aside from that I have met John 3 times and Joe twice that I recall (once at his wedding, when I was 12, the only person I knew was my dad, and I was not included in the “family seating” so was very uncomfortable the whole time). They otherwise lived in a different part of the country near the rest of my father’s family. They both also seem to be exhaustingly self absorbed and narcissistic. John has been in legal trouble multiple times since he was a teen.

The last time I met them was when dad passed, when I was 14 and James was 12, and they essentially came to collect all of his belongings and the majority of his ashes. The only things returned to us from the possessions they retrieved from his house were two of our large collection of baseball bats, because John graciously told us “if you want to pick one each to keep that’s alright with me”

After that they vaguely tried to keep in contact, telling us every couple years or so we should convince our mom to “send us to visit them” in another province (keeping in mind mom was single with two teenagers and they were adults with careers who wanted her to foot the bill)

When James graduated a few years ago he invited Joe to celebrate with him, but when they learned they wouldn’t be able to attend the actual ceremony due to shortage of tickets, they changed their minds last minute.

John invited me to his wedding a few years ago and while I originally planned to go, between some things he posted on Facebook in the meantime and the fact that it would have been exorbitantly expensive with travel and accommodation, I opted out.

Ended up very glad I did because he literally didn’t notice that I wasn’t there (messaged me after to say “sorry I didn’t get a chance to talk to you at all at the wedding”)

Anyway I’ve recently deleted them both off of Facebook due to Joe being for the most part a vapid egomaniac, and John posting things that vary from slightly ignorant to outright bigoted.

And I’ve come under a certain amount of fire for that and for just referring to them as “my dad’s older sons” because blood is thicker than water and all that.

Am I the asshole for not feeling they’re entitled to my consideration as family when they’ve been less than considerate toward me and James our entire childhood"
788,dbkhk8,"AITA For Trying to Quit a Freelance Job Midway Through? There is a woman I'm doing a freelance job for. The job is very work intensive.

Ultimately, she isn't very good at communication. Every project I've had with her is painfully long because she either can't open a link I sent her, tells me to send it to a different email, or lets the link I send her expire (I've sent her the link through 3 different sites). For this specific project, I was working from instructions sent by this woman's coworker from another country. This 2nd lady always makes the most detailed instructions and I love working with her. When the lady I'm currently working with took over, I kept running into problems like the ones I mentioned above.

When sending her the project, I sent a precursor email to this woman saying that the whole checklist was marked off and I was waiting for more instruction (which the lady in a different country was supposed to send but got cut off since the new lady is now on the project). When she finally gets the project that I have worked on for 10 hours, she tells me that it doesn't look very different. I felt that she doesn't take the time to look through my work or to read my email I sent her.

On top of this, I asked her to pay me for the last project I did for her. She ignored my text for 3 days so I sent her a venmo request. She ignored this for another 3 days. I finally texted her again, and she told me I needed to make an invoice for my payment. I make the invoice and send it. A full month later, I finally get paid but not after finding out she had lied about sending my invoice to the accountant of the company earlier than she had told me.

I texted her and told her that I didn't want to work on this project anymore and that I would give her all of my work for free to compensate for any wasted time. I told the lady the reasons I didn't want to work on this anymore (late payments, untimely responses, miscommunications, etc). She sent her sister (another person I work for) to apologize for her through instagram.

So then I caved and told her I would do the rest of the project. I'm about to hop on the phone with this lady in 10 minutes and I'm afraid of the harsh things she might say after I tried to cancel the project. IF she gets rude, am I the asshole if I hit the eject button on this thing?"
789,az4iw0,"AITA for asking when two people are going to leave their booth at a cafe? hear me out on this one 

My SO and I had planned to attend a jazz performance at a small cafe, and we paid for our tickets in advance. You were supposed to have bought a ticket to be in the cafe during the performance. We get there before it starts and order our food. The place is pretty packed, and there were no open tables. But we figured that if we waited a little for the music to start then people who weren't planning to stay for it would be clearing out.

Unfortunately this never happened. We had our food brought to us and we were basically awkwardly standing in the corner, holding our plates and hoping that a table would clear soon. I think eventually somebody brought us some plastic stools or something but it still really sucked given that we had paid for the opportunity to be here.

One of the waitresses alerted me that there was two ladies in a booth that were supposed to be leaving, as they didnt pay to stay for the music, so they should be gone soon. Guess what, they never left either. They had finished their food 30-45 minutes ago and were still here. The waitress kept apologizing to me. I was pretty pissed at both the cafe for prioritizing people who didnt buy a ticket over us, and also the women for not having self awareness. After about 45m to an hour from when the performance started, and my SO was already visibly upset by how everything was turning out, I went over and tried to politely ask the women if they'd be leaving soon. I get that this would be rude under normal circumstances but I didnt really give a shit. They give some BS answer like ""oh yes we were JUST about to leave"" (sure) and I go back to my SO hoping they'll just go. But nope, first they call over the waitress to tattle on the big bad man who just dared to ask them when they were leaving, who then comes to me and sternly tells me ""please dont ask our customers when they'll be leaving."" and on top of this the women stayed another half hour or something, clearly just to piss me off.

790,esj52v,"AITA for not picking up my girlfriend? My (21M) gf (18f) went to her sisters house which is about an hour and a half away. I was at work yesterday, talked to her on my break at 3:45pm, and when I got off at 6pm she texted me and said she was gone for the night. We live together so I thought it was kind of inconsiderate to randomly leave without letting me know ahead of time. She said it was last minute but I’m highly doubting she didn’t know of the plan to go to her sisters 2 hours prior to her leaving because it would take her sister almost that long to come get her anyways. I should also mention my girlfriend doesn’t have a car so she’s constantly needing rides from her parents and I.

Anyways, she calls me today and tells me that her sisters daughter has lice and that I need to come pick her up. We’ve had a situation similar to this in the past where she went to her friends house (also about an hour and a half away) and decided at about 9pm that she wanted to leave and demanded I came and picked her up. I had plans to hang out with my friends that night (which doesn’t happen often) but I sucked it up and picked her up. The difference this time is, there’s a forecast of constant snow in about 2 hours and I’m not trying to drive in bad weather, or get stuck staying out of town for a day or two until the weather clears up. 

I told her that I wasn’t able to pick her up and that she should ask her parents. After all, last time they told me to go get her from her friends house and I did. They don’t have work tomorrow and are just as able to pick her up as I am. I told my parents the situation and my mom (who is a co-sign on my auto loan) said she didn’t want me to. My girlfriend is now saying I’m being hostile and that I only respect my moms decisions when it benefits me. 

At first I had told her I didn’t want to because I didn’t want to: a) drive that far and b) possibly crash my car. I followed that up with my moms wishes that I don’t drive out there. Am I being the asshole for not picking her up?"
791,dl909p,"AITA - In-Laws Treat Hubby Unequally At Wedding Hi all! So recently my partner and I got married. I have a LOT of JNSIL and JNMIL moments throughout our relationship but this time maybe hubby and I are the assholes.

We got married and my beautiful parents happily paid for majority of the day. MIL doesn't offer any contribution which is fine by me. Hubby is a bit upset about this, because MIL contributed $5,000 to BILd wedding plus paid BIL's and all bridal party suits, and $5,000 for SIL as well as her dress. MIL always complains about how she contributed to BIL's (who I love and get along with) wedding because she believes they never should have got married so I didn't want those snarky remarks made about me anyways. The wedding comes closer she offers $4,000 for the bar tab which is incredibly generous and kind. Obviously we are extremely thankful and I express this multiple times. Hubby mentions going to buy his suit etc but she shows no interest and doesn't offer anything. I assure him it's really no big deal and not to stress, but he feels upset because as parents we try to keep everything equal with our children and he feels a bit deflated like he isn't worth as much as his siblings, he just assumed it would be fair. 

Anyways I steer him away from being upset throughout the lead up and we have the most perfect wedding day (despite lots of JNMIL and JNSIL moments for another day). It's standard here to have a wishing well in lieu of gifts, and this is what we did. So the next day we are reading our beautiful cards and are overwhelmed with how generous our friends and family have been. Hubby does notice no card from SIL and is devestated. At BILs wedding all the family were ""required"" to contribute a significant amount towards his honeymoon as organised by SIL. At SILs wedding, they contributed that same amount to the wishing well so it was equal. Obviously people can contribute whatever they want to a wishing well and don't have to contribute, so I'm not going to complain that they contributed nothing despite hubby feeling a bit hard done by. However I feel she could have at least put in an empty card. They're very well off financially, so it blows my mind they can't fork out $2 for a card. We also receive a text from MIL with her account details so we can transfer remaining bar money.

Am I the asshole for being a bit pissed at how unequal they've made hubby feel?? I know it's not a competition of who spends more, but I do think it's a bit harsh to spend different amounts on one child to the other. And to not even put in a card just seems so rude, especially as we've been to plenty of weddings with them and they've always put in a card and contribution to the wishing well, so it's kind of an obvious snub towards hubby (actually probably towards me but he's the one feeling the real brunt of it and taking it personally)"
792,cb0z08,"WIBTAH for refusing to move out I live in an area where accommodation/flat shares are hard to come by. I had planned to be going away in August to do field work. My flat would then be vacant. It was brought up that the employee of a friend of my landlady needed housing. She asked so I offered that he stay with me for a few weeks and then he wanted to take over my lease when I left.  we'll call him John. John arrived last week, moved in and began work. But i've been sick. Very sick, they still don't know what wrong but I need tonnes of medications and a lot more testing. I told my land lady I was ill last month and that I might be staying in the area. Then I informed my landlady that I wanted to stay on and retain my lease 20 days in advance of when I said I would be leaving. She seems to think it's up to John  to decide if he wants to keep me as a flatmate as I did say I was planning to move out (he doesn't, I've talked about it with him and he wants his buddy to move in). I'll also add that the lease is still in my name, I am 100% legally allowed to stay on, so there's no issue, I will suffer no legal ramification for refusing to vacate. I'm also quite pissed than I invite John into my home because he had nowhere to live and then he wants to oust me from my flat, it seems rude. That aside, I have offered to share my flat with him cause I know housing is hard to come by this time of year, and this seems the only fair option. However, John is dead set on sharing with his friend ( who will have no where to live) and has told me I need to move out (which he can't legally do). I know i'm legally in the right, but am I the asshole for telling him and my landlady I'm not moving out since my plans changed due to being sick?

Edit: I didn't know John's buddy existed and planned on living in the flat till John was moving in. I offered john housing, and i'm still offering him housing. He was the one to go and invite his friend to move in. I would have advised him not to if i had known due to me being ill. so...while i'm sorry about his friend not having a place to live, i have no accountability for that one. I was told it was just one bloke.Edit 2: John has no sublet, i'm not subletting at all. He is staying here because my landlady asked me, there's no legal agreement that allows him to sublet."
793,apk45t,"AITA for breaking up [M21] with my GF[20] because of her ghosting? My GF is on her mobile constantly. Facebook, Whatsapp you name it. She is using her phone quite often to look at random stuff constantly (sometimes even when I am around but luckily only sometimes.)

The issue I have with her is that sometimes she can go 2-3 days without any peep from her. I sometimes need her urgently and she still doesn't respond. Phone calls, SMS and Whatsapp messages, I can't reach her with nothing. And after that she appears out of nowhere and acts like nothing happened. When I ask her where she's been she told me she got busy with work and college and couldn't respond at all. (which I find very hard to believe because someone as phone bound as her couldn't hold out without her phone for even half a day).

&#x200B;

What brought my blood pressure up is that she does this without warning, and I sometimes see her online on messenger/whatsapp that she was active not too long ago but still doesn't respond. I sometimes need her urgently (don't wanna go into detail about exactly what, but in my judgement it's something that should be adressed quickly and many times were in a bad situation because of her lack of response). I'm not controlling and don't care much about response time, I myself find responding to her every few hours if it's something unimportant because I also have my own work, but whenever she needed me and called me I was available for her 99% of the time even though I am on my phone a lot less than her.

&#x200B;

After the 10th time of her doing it in the past 6 months I told her she should atleast give me a warning or something because I know she is straight up ignoring me because I see when she is online but she either ignores my request or tells me I'm controlling.

AITA? "
794,eb0fhd,"WIBTA if I tell an acquaintance I believe she's being abused by her husband? I don't want to go into too many details because I don't know what to choose from and also I know both people involved are redditors. I'll try to flesh it out as much as I can. 

I have a coworker (31m) who I started getting to know this year. By his own admission he's an alcoholic and has problems with his emotions. He and his wife (28f) are experiencing major marital issues for the last year or so.

I got to meet his wife and I felt that she needed a friend more than he did. Part of that is because I have experienced how he talks and behaves toward her and I find it emotionally and verbally abusive. I chose to stop hanging out with him and become her friend. 

As I got to know her a bit, she told me that she isn't happy with her marriage but she's heavily medicated after having a mental breakdown this summer, due to her marriage getting particularly volatile. She blames herself because that's what he is telling her every day. He calls her all the terrible names you can imagine and gaslights her when she tries to address her issues with the relationship. I've witnessed this in person. It was horrible to witness and I didn't know what to say, I'd never seen someone act that way in person. 

I recently went to a group hangout at her house and of course he was there too. In front of a group of people he continued to be verbally abusive. He made an incredibly crude sexual remark about what he was going to do to her and everyone was speechless. I left soon after and its been bugging me since then.

She blames herself and has said she just thinks she needs to accept she won't be happy or have a romantic relationship in her life. She seems beaten down. I feel like she has never had someone tell her that she doesn't deserve this, and that it's abuse. She's being told every day it's her fault and it's what she has to accept.

Will I be the asshole if I tell her that I believe she's being abused? I'd make sure to tell her that Im only telling her because I think she has been blamed and I want her to know that it's not her fault and she doesn't deserve it. I don't want her to think I'd judge if she chooses to stay, there are obviously reasons for her to stay. But I don't want her to stay just because she thinks it's normal and she deserves it. I just don't know if its something I should even mention."
795,byaijc,"Aita For ignoring a kid after telling them No? So here is the deal, i just graduated from highschool and so im 18 and still live at home. I live with my mom, two older sisters and a 5-year old nephew.  My girlfriend came over to visit and stay the night, this happens literally every week. And the 5 year old, adores her. So much so we probably spent like 4 hours with  him this weekend after he would just come into my room and play video games and stuff. 
And so he was with us and kept asking us if we wanted to go swimming. Now, we told him that no we didnt feel like it. Ofcourse he is 5 and didnt like this answer. He asked again and we said no. His mom (my sister) comes into my room and litterally cannot get him out of my room. Because he wants to stay with us because we are sort of like the cool older kids. So we have to walk to the kitchen with him and this is when he asks us again, over and over. His mom is trying to say, no"" ill go swimming with you"". Eventually my mom (the 5-year old's grandma) just blows up at me and my girlfriend for ignoring him.  Saying how rude and he isnt stupid that he deserves a real answer. But the thing is, its very situational because if we did say no again, he would have thrown a fit and my mom and sister would be pissed at us for saying no. But if we said yes, than it would be a hassle for them to go swimming too. Also, we swam with him the day before, and it was around 7:30 pm when he asked us.
So reddit, what should i have done? This morning, the day after,  my mom is really blowing up about it.

Edit: she really blew up about it today but i told her that we already answered him in my room. She sort of quieted but she was still angry"
796,cgjhcv,"AITA for being angry that a guy let women go on the bus first Please read my story before deciding if I’m the asshole and before calling me an incel in the comment section. I’ll try to be as detailed as possible and answer any questions you guys have about the situation. 

I live in Philly and was returning home after finishing classes at my university. I was waiting for a bus at Frankford Transportation Center at the end of a “line”. When the bus rolled up and, after some people upfront entered, some dude not affiliated with SEPTA (SEPTA is the transportation system in Philly) decided to hold the bus door and said that the women should go in first and that he’ll go in last. 

The people around were confused and was wondering what was going on. Essentially the guys just let the women go in the bus first. No one caused a fuss cause it was hot and no one really wanted to make a scene. While they were getting on, he was saying stuff about how the women make the world go around and was smiling with this smug, gleeful look. Then, when the line with all the guys was about to move, he ushered in some women who just got to the bus stop to come in. Once they got in, the rest of the people came in and the dude just left. He wasn’t even taking this bus yet he was waiting in line just to pull this stunt. 

It was a shitty situation to be in. It kinda felt like the situation when you pay for your groceries and the cashier asks if you would like to donate and when you say no then the cashier would make a loud exclamation about it and it makes you feel like an asshole. If any of the guys spoke up, I felt like they would have been berated with statements like “you don’t respect women.”

I felt a bit pissed off after this whole thing for a lot of reasons. For one, I’m a big believer in lines and that you’re an ass if you’re cutting in line unless there is a reason why you are doing it. Like a person paying extra cash to skip a line at a theme park or if they’re disabled/old. I’m also fine with people allowing others to go ahead if it’s not too many people. I understand being nice and allowing some people to get in ahead of you but when there was a line already formed and your making people from the back and people who came late go in before people who were in line and patiently waited because you wanted to be chivalrous then you’re a bit of an ass since you’re telling people that their time is not worth another person’s time. 

Also, there was the fact that the dude was not even getting on the bus. He literally pulled a stunt like that with a smug smile just to do it. I get doing nice gestures  just to be nice and not expecting something from it but there were other things he could of done and it was shitty of him to go to a random bus and pull a stunt like that. 

So reddit aita for being anger at the dude for pulling this stunt?"
797,dimpww,"AITA for avoiding my boyfriend's friends? My boyfriend and I live on the same campus but we're in different dormitories (there's multiple buildings for student accomodation here). Two of his friends that aren't actually his closest friends have a room on the first floor of their dorm and when I come over like eighty percent of the time I see them on their balcony smoking. It's really difficult not to encounter them.

Anyway I don't like these two people at all. They're a girl and a boy who worked with my bf last summer, and they've attended one course together, that's how they know each other. They both seem judgmental and act like they're still high school students, worry about who's popular and treat others like a source for gossip. The problem is my boyfriend isn't that kind of a person but he turns into it around them.

Basically I feel really weird talking to them because we don't have anything in common and I'm not good with small talk so that part is even worse. When I come into the building and see them outside, I usually just quickly say 'hi' and go in or pretend I didn't notice them.

They seem offended though because the last time I came over and they were in my bf's room, they teased me about running away from them when I see them outside. I told them and my boyfriend I'm just socially awkward but they didn't like it and said, indirectly, that it's impolite in their opinion. They talked about someone else as an example but obviously referring to this situation.

AITA for doing this? Coward? I don't know, my bf's already aware I'm not a huge fan of these people and he doesn't care because they're not his best friends, they just happen to live nearby for hanging out, but they all seem to agree that it's rude what I'm doing."
798,cc201f,"AITA for thinking about removing my mother from my life This post originally was 3 times as long but i had to delete alot because the limit

My dad was not a good father figure. He was involved in a lot of crimes and had to go to jail often. My mother left my dad when I was 1 year old. Which I think was a good choise. I didn’t have contact with my dad anymore sinds I was 6 years old

My mother moved back in with my grandparents after leaving my father which i understand because it was the best

Then my mother got a new friend, which i actually did like. He was kind to me but after a year she decided it didnt work because “he was to boring”

Not long after that when i was 5 years old she got a new friend again even though i wasn’t over the old father figure i finaly had in my life. 

She got pragnant again from this new boyfriend and decided they should move in together as soon as possible. And the worst thing was that i didn’t like my new “father” and he didn’t like me either. 

I was a difficult child. His approach on this was really bad though. When I kicked someone he used to kick me back with his working shoes. When I didnt want to wear my safety belt in the car he once went to the emergency lane on the highway and he hit brake with full speed which Made me smack my head against the Seat in front. He locked me in my room for leaving my room when i had to sleep or locked me in my room as a punishment for multiple hours. My mother let all of this happen without doing anything.

I started living my own life because i didnt feel safe in my own home. I worked alot at a young age because I had to

Then my parants started complaining I was never home and when I was home I didn’t follow their rules. Restrictions about gaming time.. rules about not wearing shoes in the house.. not leaving lights on.. rules my sister also broke but I had to give the right example so they only punished me. 

Then when I was 17 years my mother finally decided she wanted to break up with my stepdad. Then a few days later after an arguement my stepdad decided I wasn’t welcome anymore.

So after that i started living with my aunt for a month. My mother couldn’t find another house to live and had my sister so she stayed with my stepdad. I wasn’t allowed back in

I then started living with my grandparents for half a year and after that i found my own room which was near my school. This all went well until I got financial issues because my education didn’t fit me and I started working but then in the winter at Some point there was no work for me anymore. I asked my mother to contribute but the sayd she couldn’t so i moved back to my grandparents. 

Now im trying to get my life back on the rails again with new work until i start with my new education and i work 40-80 hours each week to get a stable financial situation and because I have to pay for my own school and living on my own again and my mother just doesn’t give me the feeling she cares for me

Am i overreacting? Expexting to much? 
Am i the asshole?"
799,c6q8kw,"AITA for not letting my boyfriend take a picture of me? I had to go pick up a dress this morning, and I brought my boyfriend along to get it. On the way, he says he's gonna take a picture of me in it (I don't wear anything fancier than blue jeans most of the time), and I tell him not to.

So we get to the bridal shop, and I ask for it. While she searches, me and BF start talking about it. He mentions at one point how I never feel like dressing up nice. (Which is true.)

The girl finds the dress and asks if I want to try it on. I'm curious to see how it looks in its proper color, so me and him head over to the dressing room. I get in it and go out to show him. 

Now at this point, I'll admit, I don't think I look good. The dress looks fine, but still needs altering (it's long and I'm not), my hair's a mess, I have a very exposed bra strap due to the dress style. Just- no effort, just want to see how the pink looks. He compliments me all over for it, and before I turn around to go back, I see his phone raising up. I immediately turn it down and hear a click of the phone shutter. Immediately remind him that for the last time, I didn't want that, I don't look good. ""But Verdant, you look fine!"" Well, I don't feel fine, please respect my wishes and knock that off. A couple seconds of back and forth, then I go back in and change. 

Now, between the rebagging of the dress, the ride home, and now, I can't help but feel dickish. I know it's gonna be a bit before I alter it and feel okay with wearing it, so I feel bad for taking that. On the other end, this isn't the first time he disregarded my feelings on having my picture taken, so I'm glad I pointed it out. So Reddit, AITA here?"
800,d7gim3,"AITA for not wanting to leave my toddler (3M) unsupervised with MIL (51F) Okay, so my MIL. Love her as a person, shes very generous, kind, and worldly. Always down to try new things. BUT, she has done some REALLY questionable stuff with our son Jake.


Instance 1: we went to a bbq in support of our local salvation army.  we are waiting in line, when Jake sees someone on a scooter under a gazebo with about 5 other men. I tell him it's someone else's scooter, not ours to touch. The guys were a little sketchy looking, and I try not to pass judgement but I used to work with high-risk offenders and almost all of them lived at the Salvation Army, so I'm very cautious. She offers to take him over to see the scooter. I couldn't hide my reaction. I was like ""uhhhh NO?? I dont know those men"", and she started rolling her eyes, and said ""it's just someone's bike in a public space"" and scoffing at me. I reiterated that she was absolutely not taking the toddler over to a group of people who are strangers to us, and that I'm trying to teach him that he isnt entitled to other people's stuff just because hes interested. She rolled her eyes, scoffed again, and that was that.


Instance 2: yesterday she came over and brought an apple in that she found in our yard. We dont have an apple tree. Truth is, Jakey found it at daycare and we left it outside and told him we were going to give it to the birdies. But this was context she didnt have. So she comes in and says ""I found this in the yard, I thought Jake could have it"". She was going to just....give him a completely random piece of fruit she found in the yard, no apple tree in sight, no idea where it came from. We explained, we dont know where it came from so we left it outside for the birds/deer and again! Rolling her eyes, telling us it's not a big deal. There are lots of other small things, but these are just two of the more concerning incidents recently.


At this point, I really dont feel comfortable letting her take our son anywhere unsupervised. She just is so naive and always making jokes about how it's fine to let children do dangerous things because she did as a child and was fine. She keeps hinting at buying a car seat but I am so not in support of it. Its important to me she gets to see her grandson, just not unsupervised at this point. But AITA?"
801,ehts7v,"AITA for not giving my sister a gift when I gave one to everybody else? My sister (27f) is objectively pretty shitty. She has shamelessly lied to, stolen from, and taken advantage of everyone in my family. She does struggle with a lot of mental health issues so I know she doesn't 100% choose to be this way, but she does make plenty of choices with no regard for how they will affect anyone else. Her son (9m) has lived with my parents for the past year and a half. I live 1000 miles away from the rest of my family and go back home a couple of times a year. 
 
She and I don't really have a relationship after a big fight a few years ago. When we're in the same space now we just kind of coexist, and don't engage in conversation. She has been living with my grandparents for mental health reasons for a few years now. 

When I came back for Christmas this year, my sister was MIA with my grandma's car, which she has permission to use only under specific conditions. She was gone for multiple days with no communication about her whereabouts. My nephew called her at least 20 times a day wanting to see her, but she was either unreachable or told him she’d “be home in an hour”. He’s used to her letting him down, but I found him crying by himself multiple times.
 
So here's the actual situation: I went on a trip earlier this year and bought small souvenirs to give my family members (~10 people) as Christmas gifts. I even got my sister something because I thought it would be nice, but didn't end up wrapping it. I figured I'd been home for 3 days at that point and hadn't seen her yet and she was being shitty, so why should I bother? I honestly assumed she wasn't going to show up for Christmas.
 
Well my sister miraculously showed up on Christmas Eve night, and we opened presents. I gave a few people similar things so I had them all open theirs at once, but otherwise it wasn't really a ""production"" of me giving out gifts from my trip. It's worth noting that presents from my sister ""hadn’t shown up yet”, so nobody got any gifts from her. 
 
A few days later, my mom sat me down and told me I had really hurt and humiliated my sister by not giving her a gift when I gave one to everybody else. I was astonished because it hadn't even occurred to me that she would be singled out, since I have a different (non-)relationship with her than I do with my other family members. And also, why should I be expected to cater to her feelings when she has never cared about anyone else's (as displayed by her stealing my grandma’s car and ignoring her son for days)?! I got lectured about how it would've been “the right thing to do"".
 
Was I the asshole here? I usually consider myself to be very thoughtful and conscious of other people's feelings, but maybe I made a huge faux pas. I did end up leaving the stupid magnet for my parents to give to her because after all, I did get it for her. 
 
TL;DR: semi-estranged sister disappeared and was shitty leading up to Christmas. I didn't bother wrapping her gift and just gave gifts to everyone else. AITA?"
802,bp4dtv,"AITA for not sharing my past with close friends? PS: This is somewhat of a drunk rant, apologies. 

Hi Reddit, I have had a few annoyances with a lot of very close friends as of recently, and one of them seemed to have 'blown up' about it. 

Long story short, I grew up in a very broken household. At one point, my parents nearly had a shootout in our livingroom when I was very young. I ended up joining a new and small local gang, initially as a runner (cocaine for richer outoftowners), then as a bruiser when I hit my growth sprout. I did a lot of things that I am not proud of. But I was lucky enough that a man stepped into my life as a step-father, and really changed my course. So I get a education, and a really respectable job, more education and friends from very fortunate backgrounds (which I feel may funnel into this discussion). 

Now the point of this post:

These friends like to share, and I like to share as well, but not of those years. This is because I personally believe that I should not be defined by those years, and I don't want them to be known because I know very well that it makes people nervous and can shape their opinion of me negatively. 

It has always been a bit of a touchy subject, where if someone asks me I'll give very vague answers. I've had a few friends say: ""even though I've known you for so many years, I feel like I don't actually know anything about you"". With one friend in particular, he confronted me directly about the issue. The argument went like this:

I really care for them, they're a really good friend of mine and I don't want anything to conflict with that. I also do not want to be defined by my harsher past, as edgy as that sounds. So, whenever confronted (by close friends) about it, I will just say that I'd rather not talk about it, and leave it at that. 

To be fair to my friends, they might feel like something fishy might be going on, and assume from that that I have some malicious agenda. But most of them have told me that they find it difficult to connect with me and trust me when I am being so secretive. This is especially true in relationships.

Am I the asshole for being secretive about this specific issue? Sorry for the long, poorly-written rant. If anyone feels like they need more details do tell (since I want to keep this relatively short)."
803,cuvijn,"WIBTA for refusing to be a monk at my girlfriend’s grandfather’s funeral? So tomorrow is my girlfriend’s grandfather’s funeral. He was Buddhist and is a first generation immigrant who was pretty religious. 
From what I’ve learned it’s customary for monks to attend the funeral, whether that be life long or temporary monks. Both my girlfriend and her mother want me to be a monk because I already have very short hair (almost bald). However, I don’t believe it to be appropriate. I believe it’s inappropriate given that I’ve only ever met her grandfather once, and he wasn’t in any condition to talk to and get close with. I also believe that it’s inappropriate because not only am I not Buddhist, but I’m not even religious at all. And it’s not that I don’t want to accept their culture, I just believe it would be disrespectful to take the oath and wear religious monk clothes when I don’t share their religious beliefs.

I know it sounds horrible, but I just can’t convince myself that her being my sister is a good enough reason to keep being in her life. I know her Aspergers is partially to blame for some of the issues I have with her, but just because there’s a reason for the behavior doesn’t mean I should just have to be ok with it.  She is legitimately one of the meanest people I have ever met. She takes genuine pride in saying the most hurtful things she can to others. She is completely narcissistic to the point where she has ruined our younger brother’s relationship with our family by interrupting him so often that he’s completely given up on trying to have conversation with anyone. She is violent and has caused my father to need stitches several times from biting him. She’s hit us with dining room chairs, stabbed people with pencils, and over Christmas threatened to maim my boyfriend. 

Our parents have never done anything to stop or correct her behavior, simply saying that she’s special needs and can’t help herself. She once punched me in the face so hard that she broke my glasses, and instead of disciplining her my mother told me that if I ever hit her back or tried to defend myself against her she would call the police on me and disown me. 

I know my parents are a big part of why she’s like this, but she does know better. She’s not stupid by any means. She doesn’t do it when she’s around her life skills instructor, because he would (and has) chewed her ass out for bullying another student. 

So for the past few years I’ve been distancing myself from her and this holiday season has really cemented it in my mind that I no longer want anything to do with her. I’ve decided to have a conversation with my mother and let her know that I have no interest in seeing my sibling anymore and to please not ask me to attend events that she will be at. I’ve tried for the past 15 years to look past all that and get along with her, but I don’t think I care enough anymore. I used to ignore it and think I was being the bigger person, but at this point I’m not willing to let these things go and I’m tired of fighting every time I see her. 

I hoped so badly that as she got older she’d become a nicer person, but she’s just gotten meaner. We’re both adults now, and I’m at the point where I am really starting my own life and my own family. I am not willing to deal with the stress and anxiety of hoping she doesn’t decide to insult or assault me or my loved ones every holiday. "

With that being said today while bsing around with her she started talking about how she and J met, they were at a costume party at J’s house that her ride left from early so she stayed at J’s place for the night, she tells me her and J slept on the same couch and yada yada but again I had no problems. She gets to a part in the story about how she and J almost had sex once, I was taken a little off guard by this because I was under the impression that he is gay. When I told her that I was confused and that I thought he was gay she just told me that she thinks he only says he is gay but he is actually straight. I told her it weirded me out that she never thought it would be worth telling me that the guy she spends hours a day and sleeps over with isn’t gay like she told me he was, now she won’t speak to me. Again I have no problem with her having gay or even straight guy friends but her lying to me made me feel off like she is hiding something here, AITA?

Edit: She still only gives me a sentence here and there and I get the general sense that she is pissed at me, she is saying she is mad that I don’t trust her and that I want her and john to not be friends anymore (I NEVER said any of that, not even implied it, at least not intentionally). I’m at my wits end, I’ve told her she is fine over and over again but that it bugs me that she lied about something like that but she is way more distant than she really has a right to be over something like that"
806,d2u827,"WIBTA if I called animal services/authorities on my neighbours dog? Background info: My family has lived in our current house for the past 8 years and we have had the same neighbour on the one side the whole time. They have a rescue dog which is essentially some kind of mix with a rotweiller - about 100lb dog. I did not see the dog often except occasionally through our shared fence. This dog has attacked multiple dogs and people. One of the dogs it attacked nearly died and they did cover the thousands in vet bills. 

So last year I was dog sitting two older golden retrievers (very sweet and timid) and was nearing our house when I saw the neighbours dog at the end of their driveway. In 2 seconds he was across the street trying to attack myself, my partner and the 2 goldens we were walking. He was trying to clamp down and bite them, barking and jumping on both of us, clearly in attack mode. I was pushing the dog off and yelling at it trying to get it to back off and get my neighbours attention. After a terrifying minute or two the neighbour came out and I yelled at her to get her dog. She came over and got the dog and I went inside. Both of us and the dogs were shaking and terrified, although no blood was shed. The neighbour came over and apologized saying the dog ""has issues with other dogs and leash agression"". She said they ""don't know how he got out"". I acknowldged her explanation but did not say ""its okay"" or anything like that. 

In hindsight, I should have called animal services then but my parents told me they ""didnt want to cause issues with the neighbour"". Now at home I am scared to go out in the front lawn and even in my backyard of fear he will jump the fence and attack us. I also worry for others on the street like kids and the elderly that would not have a chance against that dog. WIBTA if I called animal services on the dog?"

Anyway, I moved out of my hometown to University to finally get that life I always dreamed of. Once I graduated, I got into a good career and met this fantastic woman who I'm now engaged to. We're in our twenties and extremely happy. 
We wait to tell my parents first before anyone else (which was not easy since we didn't have the opportunity to see them until 4 weeks later) only to be given the reaction of ""oh, well done"". 

Okay, Im the first in my family to be engaged and this is the big congratulations. That was literally it - they didn't even offer to celebrate any other time. In fact the whole subject was avoided every time it came up. 
They flat out refuse to come to our wedding because it's going to be abroad. 

Cutting to the incident: I asked my brother (who still lives at home with them) to cat sit for me. He agreed he'd did do it for free, we took him shopping for his food (£120 for 7 days) and he told me he'd pay me back for that. Sweet! 
Go on holiday, come back, everything's great. 

My dad rings me up saying we have a problem. 
He wants to know why I'm asking my brother for money. Starts calling me cheap and disrespectful - all those childhood feelings of dread knowing a bad night is coming start to flooding back. 
My fiance sees my face, takes the phone off me and speaks to him. 

""I think you need to calm down. When you've done that you can speak to him again because this isn't fair.""

Well shit, this sparks off hysteria in the background with my mum shouting ""let us speak to our son!"" and my fiance staying super calm just asking them to take a calmer approach. That is until they verbally abused her something wicked. 
A LOT of insults she didn't deserve, threatening to burn her house down, saying how they're in disbelief that I'd let her talk to them like that. At this point I took the phone off of her and hung up. 

We both feel fucking terrible.
Its been around 3 months since that went down and since then my mum has messaged asking what my plans are for Xmas as if nothing has happened. 

My fiance and I are doing well again. We've talked about it and I told her exactly what would make me happy. 

I'm completely blaming them for threatening and upsetting my partner,  acting irrational and creating an uneasiness in my relationship wherever my parents are concerned.

I would be extremely happy to continue ignoring them as it's the most free I've felt in a long time. I can't even stand the thought of talking to them. 

I have three brothers who this would affect. I still talk to two of them. 

AITA if I keep this up and never get back in touch?"
808,czqgos,"AITA for not letting my mom borrow my microscope? So basically, I’m 21 and away for college, and my dad made a visit from home which is about a three hour drive. While he visits, my mom texts me asking if she could “borrow the microscope with the bug and plant slides to demo” to her clients at a garden she works for. 

Immediately I thought this was a bad idea, so I asked her “why would you want the microscope for a group of people? If you’re presenting you could instead bring pictures” to which she replied “ok”. And so I already know I’ve messed up because of that answer so I tried to explain myself by telling her:
“the microscope is heavy and expensive I just can’t seem to justify bringing it back for a bunch of people to toy with it, you know? I think pictures would be less of a hassle like a ppt presentation or something and also because only 2 of the objectives work and if you try to use the other two they’re very finicky and you could break a slide and get glass everywhere, even if you know how to use it right”

I don’t really even use the microscope for anything important it’s just something I have for fun which is why I haven’t spent much time fixing it, but it is professional equipment and it was very expensive. I just didn’t want people using it. 

So now I’m getting the silent treatment, which worries me because we are supposed to be planning a trip soon and now I’m afraid she will just be bitter and mean if she is really upset that she didn’t get her way. On her bad days she will say that nobody in the family respects her and that we all go out of our way to ruin her plans or general happiness. And now she’s saying that I never helped out around the house when I lived there and now that I’m away at college, nothing has changed and I’m still selfish like I always will be, or whatever. I won’t go in depth about her issues, but my brother (14) says I should have just gave her the microscope to avoid her reacting this way, despite the possibility of something getting broken or misused. 
Am I really an asshole for this like she says? I’ve been feeling pretty guilty but it’s hard to tell."
809,cyuxlv,"AITA for wanting my boyfriend to stay at my place occasionally? My boyfriend and I have been dating for a little over a year now. We met through a singles group doing activities all around the area, but primarily in the city where he lives because it's the biggest city in the area. He doesn't have a car because he doesn't need one. I do, but I live about an hour away. There is a commuter train that runs near where I live and it is a 45 minute train ride plus a 10 minute drive between my place and the train. So about an hour to get from my place to his or vice versa. 

When we first started dating we were still quite active in our singles group and because most of the activities were in the city where he lives we spent a lot of time at his place. It has now been a full year and I have been spending every single weekend at his place. He has been to my apartment a total of 3 times. Ever. And he definitely complained about it each time. 

I have grown weary of packing a bag and dragging it to his place every single weekend. We haven't been nearly as active in the singles group so we spend most weekends watching TV and only leaving to get food. Even for that we tend to stick to a pretty small radius right around his apartment. If that's all we're going to do then I don't see much of a difference between his place and mine. 

When I told him I can't do this every single weekend his initial reaction was that we just don't need to see each other every weekend. When I talked about him coming out to stay at my place he talked about how much he hates taking the train and that it's so inconvenient and that the one time he took a rideshare to my place he had to actually wait for a car to show up because they aren't as frequent out where I live. (That time I could not pick him up at the train because I had surgery that same day and was not allowed to drive. Usually I would be able to pick him up.) He said that he never thought this would be an issue because when we met I always came out to the city where he lives. I tried to explain that I was coming out here because I had plans to do something and now that we weren't going out as much I felt that it was fair for him to come to my place once a month. I even said that it hurts to hear him say he is okay with asking me to put in this effort, but isn't willing to reciprocate. 

So, am I the asshole for asking him to suck it up and pack a bag once a month and make the same trip I usually make?"
810,b2b1cb,"AITA for being upset on my birthday? So it’s my 16th birthday today and to sum it up it’s been a bit shit. 
It started with me waking up at 9 while my parents are at work (of course this is all good, I like my alone time anyway) I don’t see my mum till 11.

I go into the lounge and she’s set a nice array of gifts on the table with balloons and a banner and she seems quite excited about it all, as was I. 

I open the presents and my Dad comes from work (he works in a live in restaurant) to watch a few and the presents are really nice and thoughtful and above and beyond necessary as I didn’t ask for anything. I thanked her profusely and gave her a hug and all the lot.

After that, I didn’t see my mum properly until around 5, she seemed to be slightly snappy at me so I generally kept me distance until we went for dinner with my Dad. 

It started off quiet and I suggested we play cards. My mum refused. I complained as I thought it would be fun and ignite some conversation I jokingly said ‘it’s my birthday’ and she then claimed she already spent loads of money on my birthday. 

This put a slight damper on the evening but we managed to move past it when we had our meal, which was generally pretty poor. My mum was being kind of argumentative but I changed the subject when this happened and nothing erupted. 

We went home and did the whole cake thing, she got angry at my dad for not singing and then she wanted a photo of us. I made a mistake with the photo and I offered to take another but she replied ‘if anything every happens you’ll wonder why we don’t have any photos’. After that my Dad cut the cake and they sat watching a TV drama which they know I hate. 

On top of this, I didn’t get any birthday messages from the people I’d expect. I called it a night early and my mums upset that I’m being cold. 

Overall I just feel like my mum used her gifts as a compromise to treating me like it’s my birthday. A birthday is a once a year occurrence where it’s about me for a day and I don’t think it’s too much to expect a little extra kindness and attention but am I being ungrateful and over dramatic? 

TL;DR My birthday felt insincere due to not being treated as such and I think my mum used presents as a method of self-approval and as a replacement for genuine kindness, nostalgia and family bonding (as a birthday should be) 

Edit: When I mention not getting birthday messages, that’s not the reason I was upset it just slightly worsened my feelings and I fully understand people have their own lives and they’re not at fault for forgetting. "
811,e7m164,"AITA for potential backing out of a birthday celebration? Sorry about formatting, I’m on my phone.
I’ll try to keep this short. Genuinely interested in hearing what y’all think.
I met my roommate about 4 months ago. We clicked instantly, she’s super cool and we live very similar lifestyles. We’ve had no problems thus far. 
Her 25th birthday is in January, so I started to think about what might be a fun surprise to do for her. She made it clear that she loves thoughtful gifts more than just gifts for the sake of it, so I thought it would be fun to surprise her with a trip to a neighboring state and a weekend that was all about her (in a place she had specifically mentioned wanting to go). I reached out to all her friends and started organizing. A couple days after I started organizing, I got wind of a separate birthday celebration that was happening for her, involving clubbing and a different location. 
So I spoke to her and told her that I had a surprise planned (didn’t tell her what the surprise was, just that I was trying to put something together for her) and asked her what she specifically wanted for her birthday. She asked me to not reveal the surprise and to ask her friends to figure out what she wants.
So I went back to her friends and tried to figure out another plan and was immediately shut down. So then I just tried to jump on board with the plan they had going, but it sounded like it was going to be really expensive for a few nights out in a city we don’t live in (airbnb, ubers, brunch, club cover fees, drinks, dinner and lunch out, etc). I specifically told her friend that I needed to think about it but that if I didn’t go I was going to find another way to make it up to my roommate. I had fully planned on speaking to her about it in person and asking her directly if she cared about me being there.
Well I found out today that her friend went behind my back, revealed the surprise, told her I wasn’t going anymore (I have the texts to prove that I never said that), and lied about why I wasn’t going anymore (she said that I didn’t want to/it didn’t interest me). My roommate then texted me very angry and I was dumbfounded. 
Here are some additional details that might be important:
1) One of my parents JUST died (less than a month ago). I’m in a deep depression that she doesn’t seem to give two shits about.
2) I’m in my early 20s and make less than $12,000 a year (before taxes)
3) I know that my roommate has no intention of spending anywhere close to the amount I estimated on my birthday celebration (not that I would ever ask someone to do that) or really on anyone in her life’s celebration.
Am I the asshole for possibly (now, likely) not going to her birthday celebration?"

My family often commissions me to bake for family events etc. It’s also relaxing to me and I enjoy it. I just finished final exams so decided to make a treat to celebrate and decided on lemon bars. 

After baking them and them looking okay but not totally normal, I realized I forgot to put the sugar in the filling :/ my mom tasted one and she said well they’re quite tart, I can definitely tell you left out the sugar. I was like oh crap and went to throw them out and she got mad at me for wasting food and not eating any.  Which I definitely hate to do, I HATE food waste too, and it sucks, but I forgot the sugar? Yes it’s my mistake but a pretty bad and obvious one. Why should I/we force ourselves to eat something that’s really not that good when I realized what the problem is?

813,cpw153,"AITA for not wanting to deal with my STBXW brother's cat. TLDR - Brother in law dropped of his cat last July. Found my wife having an emotional affair in Sept, she moved out in August. In moving on with my life I now have a dog which stresses out the cat so he is shitting/pissing everywhere but the litter box. Gave her the ultimatum of figure out where the cat can go by Sept 1st or off to the animal shelter he goes.

Long version, Back in July of last year my Brother in Law brings over his declawed main coon that has digestive issues (He eats then occasionally pukes it up undigested). His girlfriend that he was moving in with did not want the cat around, so its now our problem. Its fine I like animals no big deal.

In July the wife reignited an emotional affair after we went to counseling, I found out in September. She moved out with our daughter (Disabled 19 year old) in October. Leaving me with our son and two cats.

Time moves on and I after much therapy i was able to move on. In April I had someone that needed a place to stay move in with a 5 month old German Shepard. (I love dogs, and cats, but prefer dogs)

Cats got the basement with the boy, finished plenty of room etc... Son's bedroom is downstairs along with his own living room. Son is 16 almost 17 and is a homebody. I took the time to slowly introduce things and one of the cats could care less about the dog. The maine coon wants 100% nothing to do with the dog at all, can't even be in the same room without arching his back up. hissing, growling, etc.. The dog just wags her tail and wants to sniff and play.

In the last 3 months he is now shitting on bedding, shitting on the carpet, the furniture, everywhere but the litter box. (I had two litter boxes down there, have added a third this morning after finding a fabric cat play thing with a wonderful 3 piles of poop).

I am going crazy, here. He is not my cat he was dropped off by someone that picked the girlfriend over his cat he had for 6 years from a kitten. I have tried numerous types of food, consulted a vet, and now spending around $40 a week because of his diet. (Found something that he only pukes up about every 3 days.) I feed both cats the same food as he will open cupboards and eat through the bag if dry cat food is anywhere around.

The stbxw has offered to take him to the vet yet again but she has yet to stop over and even try in the last 2 months. I would take him but after being made to spend almost 3k on a lawyer for a divorce that she wanted. Yes I am kinda bitter about it. (She does not have a lawyer and leaving all the paperwork up to me, I also helped her find the apartment)

He is a nice cat, very sweet and loving, but he is stressed out and its not fair to him or to me. I cannot stand driving home and thinking I wonder where I will find the nice pile of shit today.

Am I the asshole for not just dealing with my stbxw brothers cat and just adopting him as my own cat?"

It is a big house in the Rockies with too many windows. It's a bit cold in the winter and the older windows are a bit drafty, nothing crazy (have addressed this issue for years and it is mostly just the fact that there are floor to ceiling windows in a vaulted roof). Nonetheless, my gf found an old roll of unused foam weather stripping and wanted to apply it to the bedroom windows I  an unusual way. Thinking g she could use it like caulking she wanted to lay a perimeter around the window where it meets the trim... like how you would caulk something. I politely told her that it's not the right application for that job and if you hold a stick of incense to the window you will see that there is  no draft just an older cold window. I also explained how to make it feel warmer with a plastic wrap and perhaps caulking the inside. Well she lost it saying that I dont support her ideas and that I dont know everything and to let her make her own mistakes (to be fair I have shot down a few of her fairly hairbrained ideas about home improvement, mainly because she has no equity in the house and I do actually know there is a right way and a wrong way to go about diy home improvement.

So I am a programmer, in my parents mind that equals IT.

Any time they need something done with their phones or computer they want my help.

At first I was like ""yea, sure, let me show you how it's done"" for anything they wanted, wether it be downloading music/video, googling stuff, moving files from their phone to the computer etc.

This year my mom got an iphone after I pleaded her to get an android(because I knew she would ask for my help and I never touched an apple product in my life) but she insisted even after I told her I have no idea how to use it. Let it be known that this is her FIRST smartphone.

And of course she gets annoyed everytime I fail to help her despite my best efforts because I just never ever touched that OS and if she wants me to learn it I need her phone for a couple weeks.

The same goes for our brand new Smart TV, which I never touch nor use nor see. I have told my parents that I have no idea how to use it or their weird modem with their special internet channels(mostly Russian shows).

My dad gets annoyed because I get annoyed that he REFUSES to learn anything(almost anything)
Asked me to send an email I give him a 10 min tutorial on how to do it.

Next time he asks I show him again.

The 10th time I show him how.

The 20th time I ask him why doesn't he do it himself  he says ""I don't know how"" and I say ""I have shown you 10+ times"" he says ""so what? You need to do what I ask without any questions""

Today he asked me to send an sms he got to my mom's mail and I confront him saying ""Why don't you ever learn how to do it?"" And he just answers
""what do you care, I ask for your help once a week just do it."" And of course he gets angry at me for even ASKING.(and he asks for my help for anything and it happens daily)

So, normally I would take public transport home from school as my dad has to fetch my sister and I would have to wait until quite late till I can reach home.

Today, at 4.32pm he texts me saying he will reach in two minutes. I was in school doing a group project and I told my teammates that I would have to leave at 5. However, due to my dad arriving early, I have to leave earlier. My teammates didnt like this, as I was leaving early than what I said before. 

I ended up leaving at 4.35pm. I told my dad that we discussed to meet at 5pm and this made my teammates mad. He told me that he could not be always on the dot with timings as he has to plan for traffic jams and unforseen circumstances. Hence he has to leave earlier to account for these possibilities. I told him that I could come out at 5pm and he could have waited for me for 25mins.

However, this seemed to make him pissed. He got defensive and told me that I should have taken public transport and that he didnt want to wait for 25mins. also, he said that if he didnt leave earlier, he might have been stuck in traffic and then I would have to wait for him. But, in my opinion, my suggestion before still stands. He could still wait for me even if he reached earlier.

Really hasn’t been an issue in the past but now we’ve had a child and live on our own so I’m trying to be responsible with our money for the both of us. The other day Sam asked me to borrow money and I asked my boyfriend if he knew that. My boyfriend said he didn’t know he was going to ask me but that he would let him borrow the $100 himself. The next day in conversation my boyfriend mentioned Sam had already owed him $700 before he asked me for the $100, but that he told him the $100 was from me in hopes that he would actually get paid back this time. I figured Sam wasn’t going to take my boyfriend asking for the money back as seriously if it was me, so I texted him. I messaged something along the lines of “I didn’t know you already owed bf $700 or I wouldn’t have let you borrow. When you ‘borrow’ from us you’re taking away from our expenses and it’s stressful so please pay us back.” Well the next day my boyfriend found out and was LIVID. He’s usually a level headed guy but he feels I overstepped my boundaries and it wasn’t my money so I shouldn’t have said anything.

818,by45vz,"AITA for ignoring my mother’s plea to start going to church again. For some background, my mom and I used to be really close, I loved her a lot but she was also very critical of how I was as a person.  My mom was a preachers daughter and really hammered religion into my brother and I since we were born.  For some reason though I just never became the Uber religious person my family members were.

I ended up marrying my husband six months after we met, which is ironically how long my parents waited to get married. My parents always expressed how they felt that my husband was taking me away from them and that he was never letting me see them, etc. My mom was the ring leader of the accusations, never making an attempt to visit us after we moved out, despite only living thirty minutes away. She wanted us to visit every other day, my husband and I are homebodies and only visit people when we feel it’s been too long, or when someone invites us over a few days in advance.

For three years I haven’t gone to church, I stopped going with them to church because the members there were accusing my husband and I of getting married because I was pregnant and that I needed to repent (I wasn’t pregnant nor am I now.) 

My mom and I had been no contact during these three years despite my several attempts to contact her through text and fb.

A few days ago, I got a message from her saying “you’re living in sin, I’m worried about you and I cry every night thinking about how out of touch you are with God.”  My husband saw it and was livid with her, saying that he was going to give her a piece of his mind, and saying that she was a horrible mother because she had been ignoring me the entire time. I agree with him because she only texts when she finds it convenient for her.  

I didn’t respond to her and deleted my Facebook because I didn’t know what else to do, I didn’t know what to say and still don’t. But it’s been bothering me a lot, and I feel like I’m being over dramatic about the situation despite my husband telling me I have nothing to feel bad about.

819,cfr464,"AITA for telling a lady that the dog park isn’t a petting zoo I’ve lurked on this sub for so long and now I have something to post finally, not as dramatic as some others but I’d still like some feedback. 

I have a very small dog, she’s a rescued tea cup chihuahua who along with some birth defects due to her unfortunate family tree, is also very fearful of children, as a lot of tiny dogs tend to be. Because of this, she can come off as aggressive when kids get too close. It’s not usually a problem, and parents usually understand when I explain why their kid can’t play with my dog. 

My dog is okay with other dogs, of all sizes. She grew up with labs so she knows how to handle herself, regardless when she’s at the dog park I NEVER take my eyes of her. The dog park we go to is great for her because it’s big enough to where she can run around with bigger dogs but still has enough room to keep her distance and move away if she needs to. There’s also a fenced off small dog area, but we rarely use it as there’s usually no one in there. 

We’ve been going to this dog park for years, with no issues. Recently a lady came in with her two daughters, about 5 and maybe 3. I didn’t mind her at first, she said she was new to the neighborhood and her girls just wanted to meet the dogs. When they approached mine, I explained to the kids that they couldn’t play with my dog. The problem is it’s been about a month now, and almost every single time I’ve been there’s, she’s there too. I have to explain to her kids every time that they can’t touch my dog, sometimes multiple times. 

Eventually I talked to the mom about it, she gave me a weird look and said “look, they’re all fine playing together, it’s good for your dog to learn to be around kids anyway.” I briefly explained to her that that’s not how that works, but rather than make it an issue, I took my dog home. The last straw was the last time I was at the dog park, the older girl hopped the fence and fell right on top of another smaller dog, which to their credit they did apologize to the owner for. Not 5 minutes later I see the two girls corner and taunt my dog, who’s growling and barking at them, clearly terrified. The mom sees this too, and rushes over telling me to calm my dog down, and that if my dogs aggressive I should keep it in the fenced area (even though that area is for small dogs, not aggressive ones, who would even bring an aggressive dog to a dog park). 

I snapped, does she have fucking brain damage? Some sort of short term memory loss? I had already told her AND her kids to leave my dog alone. So I let her know all of this, and ended it by reminding her that the dog park isn’t a petting zoo, it’s specifically so that dogs can play freely. If the kids are preventing even one dog from doing so, they shouldn’t be there. There’s plenty of other, probably safer places for her to take her kids. Again, I took my dog and left, but not before she called me a bitch, in front of her kids.. AITA?"

Making fun of weight when I had an eating disorder. (Lol guys have them too)
Antisemitic jokes, (I’m Jewish)
Racist and homophobic jokes, (black n gay people were in our group)
Calling my dyslexic friend a ‘retard’, making them cry in front of our whole group, then belittling them for doing so.
General emotional abuse, you’re stupid, fat, ugly, etc, everyday.
Cancelling plans all the time
Stealing my girlfriends and making jokes about it in front of the whole group, (such an incel cuck apparently)

821,delx0d,"AITA for leaving my family behind? I grew up without a dad till the age of 9 because he was in another country, my mom worked two jobs, after that I watched my dad settle in the lowest point of his life fading away behind the TV watching the news. I had a knack for computers so that kept me engaged, and was alright at making friends.

To get to the point though, I am self taught. Education, dealing with life, relationships, finances, career, all of it. Everything I have accomplished was own initiative. I’ve always been behind on many things just because no one ever taught me the basics in life. Unfortunately, the things that I have been suggested to do by family has 99% of the time taken me steps behind. Whether it was criticism on spending time in the fitness, choices on education, or elsehow.

I have developed the strive to succeed and build upon myself, this has given me standards and a lifestyle. My family doesn’t have this, and as caring as they might be, they don’t seem to understand my perspective. Rather they disregard my perspectives and brush it off  as if it doesn’t matter.

Recently, a critical event happened in my life where I engaged in a political campaign. I lost, because of political manipulation, which at the time was new to me, and didn’t know how to deal with. I am grateful for the experience because it has taught me the right things at the right time in life. Due to lack of communication between my siblings and myself (because I am literally the only one that initiates any conversation or confrontation), and an overreaction from family, I was brought doctors and had to go for mental health checkup because they were worried about me because I was too positive and given the troubles I went through, wasn’t normal (I’ve always kept a healthy mindset).

What bothers me most is that everyone is told a story by them which is distinct from my truth.

In retrospect, it was my sibling who was in deep mental problems due to his 9-year long girlfriend leaving him after proposing. This situation has lost me many friends, made me socially outcast, set me back months, has taken a jab at my motivation, and has taken significant effort to get over.

Point is, I don’t believe that they mean ill.

They just don’t understand me well, never have taken much effort into doing so, and somehow entangle and dissolve my life efforts when they step into it.

Things they ofcourse do not see.

Last week, I cut things off, and I did so by confronting them on everything, with name calling, followed by a clear bye, with the intonation of likely never returning. Intended to cut things off.

This will hurt my mother most, but I feel like I cannot cut corners at this point.

This story is shortened down because I had reached the limit, but my conclusion is this:

The longer they are out of life, the better it seems to become, regardless of how their intentions are.

So yeah, AITA?"
822,da3fmk,"AITA For Dropping out of my Friends Wedding? My Best Friend is getting married in 3 years and asked me to be her matron of honor. I accepted against my better judgement. 

On the one hand, I don't agree with the marriage, I don't feel as though our friendship will withstand another 3 years (a WHOLE other story), and the fact that she wanted me to promise not to have any more kids until after her wedding.

On the other hand, having been friends for 15 years, I feel a sense of duty to her. I'm her only female friend (the rest of her bridesmaids are her siblings) so I feel like I HAVE to be there for her.

Against my better judgement, I accepted. I've debated dropping out, but still hadn't 100% decided. Well today, the moment came where I knew I'd have to, and that I needed to speak up.

Bit of background that really factors in to finally making the decision, I'm pregnant and due October 26th, but I'm also a first time mom, so there is a good chance baby will be born late.

Today Best Friend texts me and asks in a group chat if we can all go bridesmaids dress shopping on November 9th, so about 2 weeks after my due date. I let her know that since little man is due 2 weeks before, I wouldn't be able to. She counters with the 16th (a week after).

I may not love the idea of being a part of her wedding, but if I'm committing to it, I want to be 100% committed. At this time I cannot do that. I just got married last October and I know that to be in someones wedding, you really have to be able and willing to commit your time, and that by not doing so just causes way more stress on the bride. Between juggling a newborn, postpartum bleeding, and finances (Maternity leave isn't paid and we'll be lucky to scrape by as it is) I cannot give her the commitment she deserves. I thought the serious hardcore planning that required my time and finances would be further down the road, and that we'd be a bit more settled with the baby by then. I didn't realize she'd want to jump into it all this far in advanced.

So I messaged her in a private message and I told her while I am beyond honored that she asked me, I am currently unable to make the commitments she needs from me, and that I feel as though it would be unfair to her and all the other bridesmaids if I continue to count myself amongst them. I apologized and let her know that I am doing this out of love for her and not wanting to hinder her planning. After I sent her this, her quick responses turned into no responses. So I'm pretty sure she's pissed at me. I texted my mother about it since she considers her another ""daughter"" since we've been friends for so long, and she says that while it's too early to dress shop, I made a commitment and should see it through.

So reddit, AITA for dropping out of her wedding?"
823,dyj691,"AITA for being uncomfortable with a homosexual friend's flirtatious messages? DISCLAIMER : THIS STORY SHOULD NOT AT ALL BE TAKEN AS REPRESENTATION OF THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE. JUST VERY BAFFLED BY THIS.

Update: I just want to thank everyone for their wonderful feedback. I hope that I illustrated the situation as accurately as can be.



For starters, I am 22. This guy friended me on Facebook via a Star Trek group. He is in his mid to late 30's. He messaged me, we began talking and he started flirting with me. Flattered, I politely told him that I'm straight but quite flattered. We agreed upon just being chat buddies. Anyway we really hit it off as friends and end up have a good deal in common when it comes to authors, politics, and humor. Occasionally he would call me handsome and I would just be like ""Hey you too dude."" Last night we were talking for a good while and he told me he really wished I was gay. This unnerved me a tad bit as I've had a previous experience of a 60 year old man in charge of my town's facebook group try to ""groom"" me. (At least that is what I was told the appropriate term was.) 

At this point I just said ""Eh well sorry I'm not."" At this point he began telling me how physically attractive I was and described me as sexy. At this point I told him that what he was saying was making me uncomfortable. I would have felt less uncomfortable if there wasn't such an age gap. 

At this point things went a bit south as he accused me of being homophobic for telling him for being uncomfortable. At this point I explained to him that it's not merely a matter of his sexuality. That I found it to be a bit of a double standard that he of all people seemed to disregard my personal identity and orientation. It also gives off the impression that I lack value as a friend. 

Idk Reddit. I personally don't think I was being an asshole. I certainly don't believe homophobic. My gay and bi friends do not act this way toward me in real life and only mention their sexuality in passing. I'm just kind of miffed because I'm pretty a pretty isolated person and up until then I enjoyed having another person to talk to and the fact that they were a bit older made me feel comfortable to come to them with advice. Hopefully a mutual understanding can be made. Shit."
824,cmcktt,"AITA for not inviting my sister to lunch with our grandad? So today I called my grandad. I try to talk to him 2-3 times a week. He’s a widower and lives alone so I try to talk to him as much as I can. Anyways while on the phone today I told him I had no work or school today, and he said he would drive up and we would have lunch. 

So an hour or so later my youngest sister texted me asking me if I could help her with something at her apartment. I said sorry but I’m having lunch with our grandad. She got super mad saying thanks for the invite, and how she never gets to see our grandad. 

I’m like hold up, HE invited ME to lunch. Maybe if you actually took the time to talk to him every now and again you’d get invited to lunch too. Now my sister complained to my mom(grandads daughter) and my mom got onto my grandad. So now all of us are going to lunch. AITA for not inviting my sister to begin with?"
825,bosr7m,"AITA for not traveling to visit my parents? Couple years ago my parents decided to sell everything and move a 5hr drive away to a sleepy little beach town, and rent a very small run down 2 bedroom place.


When they initially spoke to me about their plans I said I was happy for them, but it's a long way away and that I wouldn't be making that drive. Perhaps once a year for a holiday. She kindve glossed over that, but said she intends to make regular monthly trips to stay with us and see her grandson (my 5year old). 


It hasn't been every month, but she's definitely made the effort to visit overnight every 3-4 months or so. Whatever she wants to do, I appreciate it but there's no expectation on my end. 


We've visited them twice, for week long holidays. (I should add their house is not set up for guests at all, they also nitpick at me a lot, and my step-dad is fairly inconsiderate when we visit) 


Aaanyways, for the last 6 months or more they've decided to just... Stop working. It's like retirement... Without actually setting themselves up first. They have very little. But on the plus side they have all the time in the world.

We don't. We have jobs and school and other obligations. Yet my mum is on my case constantly to go visit them. *It's a long weekend? Well of course you'll be coming to see us! Winter holidays? Oh the beach is still nice of course you'll come here. Husband got a new car? Oh you'll love the drive here! What a perfect first drive! We were thinking of coming to you! But since you're busy on that weekend, why don't you just come to us the weekend after?* over and over. For years. I've run out of polite ways / excuses to decline. 


Today she was at it again. I politely refused. She kept pushing. Tells me she's missing her grandson. Telling me school holidays were coming up so we'll have time to visit (this logic burns me. Shes officially retired (... At 50) and can come and go as she pleases. If it was really about missing my son she could come and fkn live with us for a month if she wanted to) 

I said ""Mum... We just don't want to go there! We haven't planned any time away, and if we did, we have several other places we'd rather go. I told you when you moved we wouldn't be visiting often so stop trying to force me to use every second of my spare time driving to you!""


It was like I just shot her. How could I be so cruel. Family makes the effort. She always comes to see us. Glad to see she means so little to me. It's not that far and I'm just being terrible and selfish.

I feel like I'm the asshole. She certainly thinks I am. I've basically just told her ""no we don't want to make any effort to see you, we'd rather do other things""

826,e1drla,"WIBTA if I ask my mother to write out a list of chores she expects me and my brother to do? I (30F) currently live with my mom (56f) and my brother (18m) due to financial hardship. I pay $400 in rent a month, work a 9-5:30pm job, and am working on my bachelor's online. I have two days off a week (sun/mon) and my brother gets home three hours before me. They are not home weekends as they use that time to go to another state to stay with my stepdad and my other brother (18, they're twins)who goes to school there (he inherited his parent's house and doesn't want to leave it alone, she wants to work at her current job until retirement)

I am the only one who cooks on weekdays. I am also expected to keep the entire 3 floor house clean, minus her room and my brother's. They do their own laundry by taking it with them on weekends. So I assigned two chores to my brother: dishes and put out the trash twice a week. He never does the dishes and rarely puts out the trash, then I get yelled at/annoyed looks from her for it not being done. I will admit I am not the most tidy person, a combo of laziness and depression, but I just want my brother to pull his weight. 

Instead he naps, plays games, or watches videos when he's home. I get GROWLED at if I try to get him to do something and often have to resort to yelling at him. I want to ask my mom to write up a chore list because talking to her about it is just not working. She argues that my brothers don't do anything because they see me ""doing nothing"" which is when I'm eating lunch or taking a break to play a game. 

My thinking is if she sees how ridiculous it is that he isn't expected to do anything that it might wake her up to the inequality. But she is doing me a huge favor letting me stay here for cheap and I worry that if I do so she might see it as me being ungrateful. I am trying to save, but money is tight for me due to past health issues. She also helped me out big time with money, which the rent is helping pay for and I think she's having money/health problems too but she won't tell me so. I am also wondering if I'm just whining and being a baby about it all, so I should drop it and just deal.

Edit: It was recommended that I add in that I have had this same level of responsibility during and since high school."
827,cyann7,"AITA for not responding to my ex best friend when her cat died and she texted me saying “no one gets how this feels except you”? Backstory: best friend of almost 18 years ended our friendship the weekend that she was moving to Colorado and “starting her new life”. This was primarily because she said our values weren’t the same anymore & that I “wasn’t at the same spot” that she was essentially. She didn’t even think to bring this up until the Sunday prior to her going away party when I drunkenly texted her how much I love & appreciated her and our long lasting friendship... so we talk & I call her out for basically saying that she’s ending our friendship because I still have good friends from our hometown. She states that my friends shouldn’t be asking how she’s doing because “they’re not my friends” I say “they’re being nice? What’s wrong with that?” Anyways, after going back & forth I decide this isn’t worth it and that maybe we really don’t share the same values anymore so I tell her that I hope CO is everything & more for her and that I’m upset with how this ended but that I’ll always be around to listen if she ever needed it. Turns out a couple weeks after we ended things her cat got really sick (I truly didn’t think much of the cat but sad to see that her time was here & they had to let her go) she then reaches out to me saying “I know you probably don’t want to hear from me and you don’t HAVE to respond but no one gets how this feels except you”.... I didn’t respond because well, frankly I hated that she used that line when she had been promoting all of her other friends for “being HER people” and all this other petty shit so I just  didn’t respond ? Then she angrily texts me a day later saying how fucked up it was for me to not comfort her and I’m just ? I sat on this thought for awhile because all of my friends & even siblings said I wasn’t wrong for not answering when she acted out the way she did after we finished things. So for everyone who read up to this point, AITA?

828,cjucfb,"AITA for ""letting"" my dog growl at another dog and bringing a ""nasty"" animal to the park? So I have an older lab that has never shown any type of aggression. He's very people and dog friendly. Of course, I'm not one of those people that think their dog could NEVER be aggressive so that's not what I'm saying. I'm just sharing this because I didn't knowingly bring a dog that acted like he did to a park - this was all new. 

Anyways, dogs are allowed at the park that I went to but must be on a leash - my dog was. As I was getting ready to leave, another, much larger dog (off leash) runs up to us out of nowhere and immediately approaches my dog. My dog is older and didn't see him immediately as the dog was behind him, but noticed when the other dog had his snout basically up his ass. When this happened, my dog immediately turned around and growled at him (which is honestly a first for my dog, I was surprised). The dog repeatedly jumped on him and my dog started barking, the other dog started growling. I tried pulling my dog away but this other dog wouldn't leave us alone and kept following us to my car. 

My dog growled again at the dog as the owner of the dog came walking up to us (walking, not running like she didn't know where her dog was). The owner screams at me ""You need to fucking control that thing"" So I told her that her dog approached my dog and wouldn't leave him alone. I mentioned how her dog was also growling and jumping on my dog and kept following us. She tells me that I shouldn't bring such a nasty animal to the park. I APOLOGIZE for my dog's reaction and say he's never reacted that way, but also tell her she needs to leash her dog or keep it at home, too. She got defensive and said her dog usually doesn't wander like that, but that my dog is the problem and he caused it and I just stood by letting him growl. So I calmly say ""Whatever lady, if your dog was leashed and you had control, it wouldn't have surprised my dog like that AND bothered him. We wouldn't even be having this argument right now."" and get in my car. As I'm leaving she takes a picture of my car and screams something at me (IDK what she said).

&#x200B;

TL;DR: An unleashed dog approached my leashed dog out of nowhere in a park with a leash law My dog, who has never reacted this way before, got defensive and growled/barked. The dog repeatedly jumped on my dog and wouldn't leave us alone (followed us to my car). The dog's owner comes up to us after what felt like forever (it was probably only a few minutes) and put the blame entirely on me and my dog. We exchange some words, I even apologize, but she refused to accept any responsibility."
829,e37v3g,"AITA for walking out after Thanksgiving dinner? So, a little backstory here; my bf (22m) and I (21f) have been together for about 4 years. I moved 3000 miles across the country to live with him and left all my friends and family back home. We live a town over from his family and had a short stint of living with them. I hate his parents. 

His mother is a fucking witch, she was an addict in her formative years and although she’s been sober since my bf was a kid, she still acts like a crackhead sometimes. Impulse control and random rage fits happen with her. This is a women who will never see eye to eye with differing opinions and is an ignorant force to be reckoned with. Her stupidity and anger are immovable. 

Her husband (bf’s step-father) is an absolute asshole. Every stereotype of a boomer that there is, fits. The old “I hate my nagging wife and those darn kids, that damn google machine, get off my lawn!” 

Every time I’ve spoken to him, I’m treated like I’m retarded. I was rear ended and my driving+car crash are the butt of his jokes. He doesn’t acknowledge my presence when visiting unless I say something to my bf that he can make fun of. 

But to get to the point, all of the typical bullshit they pull on me, they still did it on thanksgiving. I wasn’t acknowledged even when greeting them. Any attempt to converse to them, they would talk over me or walk to a different part of the house. After our meal, my bf was talking to them both about his work struggles and getting his benefits stripped while on FMLA. I casually interjected that he seek legal counsel because of the hostile work environment they created, to which his step father shot back “and what are YOU gonna do? Sue them? HA!”

I was done for the night. I stood up, grabbed my coat and said “I’ll be in the car.”

After sitting there for 20 minutes, I walked back to the house and said, “I’m leaving. You either get a ride home from your mom or me. Thank you for dinner -*moms name*- but I can’t keep subjecting myself to being treated like garbage”

My bf cried the whole drive home. I bought a tallboy from the gas station on the way home and am now steaming to myself while writing this. This was mostly for venting because I have no friends or family out west here, but thanks for reading if u did. 

Am I the asshole?

833,e7xsho,"AITA for not following an outrageous but expected tipping procedure? I am living in the US and I got get massages at a place that I LOVE.  I've gone to many places to get massages and these people, no matter who I get I end up with wonderful results and their prices are cheaper than most places.

Through a complicated system they expect me to tip about 40%.

Here's how it works:

A massage is $50, but when they post their prices they show ""~~$100~~  \> $50"" like it is a sale.  However, no one ever pays the full $100, it is a permanent sale.

Now I buy massages in bulk so I get a deal where I pay $35 a massage.

They have a sign at their counter reading:

tip guide

ok service = $5

good service = $10

great service = $15

excellent service = $20

&#x200B;

What they are asking as that customers pay 20% tip on the full price of the massage, which according to them is $100.  But that $20 would almost double what I end up paying for the massage.

As far as I know, tipping is 10% for excellent service, since they should get a good pay from their employer so the tip is actually extra income for them.  I also believe that I should be tipping based on full price, but to me the $100 is not full price since no one ever even comes close to paying that.  If everyone gets the sale all the time, it's not a sale, it's your price.  So with those thoughts in mind my tip for the masseuse should be $5.  

I feel bad giving the wrong impression so I usually tip $10-12 (I also really like the massage), but then I also end up feeling slighted a bit by the store because I tipped higher than I normally would expect to.  I don't want to overpay and play their game but I also don't want to take it out on the employee or make them think that I didn't like their service.  

So AITA for not following their expected tipping procedure?"

835,czd927,"WIBTA for backing out of taking wedding photos for a friend, with only a months notice? I recently took some engagement photos for an old highschool friend. Photography is a hobby of mine, and they liked the photos I had put up on social media. I have always been fond of her, and her fiance is awesome, so I gladly offered to do portraits for them free of charge.

Scheduling issues and environmental problems resulted in us going out on three separate shoots. While this wasn't ideal, and took more of my time than I would have liked, I was okay with it because I genuinely enjoy the hobby and it wasn't anyone's fault that we had to reshoot. I also appreciated the practice, as I've toyed with the idea of turning the hobby into a profession.

When we finally finished with the portraits, which they were pleased with, they expressed that they'd like for me to take some photos at the wedding. I was outwardly and vocally apprehensive, as that is a huge responsibility that I have never held, and wasn't entirely certain I could take. They calmed my nerves by saying they were only wanting a few group portraits of various groups like the groomsmen and bridesmaids. I agreed on the condition that these planned portraits were all to be expected, and that I wouldn't need to try and capture lovingly candid moments during the reception or ceremony. I did mention that if I found myself with the opportunity to take an amazing candid picture, I would take it, but I didn't feel comfortable with that responsibility. There was also no mention of payment, though again, I enjoy the hobby and they are friends.


I am admittedly nervous, but found comfort in the idea that I'd only be expected to take a handful of large, simple group photos.


Today I received an email from the bride-to-be, with a breakdown of the photos they are wanting to have taken. These plans include not only a much larger number of group and family portraits than expected, but also a note that I will arrive early to photograph the groom getting prepared. Additionally, she has asked if I will take photos during the Ceremony, something I explicitly said I wouldn't be comfortable with.

The wedding is in a little over a month, and with these new expectations and requests, my already existing nervousness and apprehension around photographing the wedding have increased 10 fold. I am very much considering backing out, though I am worried that A. I'd be letting down a good friend, and B. With only a month until the wedding, I'm unsure of how likely they are to vet and book another photographer in time.

If I did this as a profession and were getting paid for it, I'd gladly suck it up and do my job, but photography is something I do for fun and for likes on facebook. This has quickly become not fun.

836,cexvbe,"AITA for refusing to drive my autistic sister to work anymore? I (25 M) got into an argument with my mother today because I'm refusing to drive my sister to work anymore. 

About 5 months ago I got my sister a job working with me. I know they say not to work with family but my sister is 19 and is high functioning autistic. I work with animals and my boss and I thought it would be good for her. Since then she's graduated high school, came our of her shell, and started handling grown things. She has her own bank account and handles her own money. The autistic part is more so her social and learning skills.

Everyday I clock out for 30 minutes to go get her and bring her to work. At first is wasnt an issue but its causing strife at work. I get a 30 minute break and then get another 30 minutes to go get my sister. At work we are not siblings, we are co workers. We dont treat each other as siblings and she doesn't get any special treatment.

I have a scooter that needs fixed. Just an oil change and a new starter relay. I did the math and I'm losing $1680 a year at minimum by getting my sister so I suggested to my mom that she fixes the scooter and drives to work. It's all back roads and is only a 10 minute ride. My mother said it's not going to happen. ""Riding a scooter is dangerous and how will someone with anxiety handle that."" I told her she needs to stop sheltering her and get her ready for the real world.

It ended up in a huge argument because she doesn't feel she can do it but I feel like it's not my responsibility to get her to work every day. It upsets my coworkers. I wouldn't leave every day to get a coworker like that, why do I need to do it for her.

I gave my mom an ultimatum last night. Told her my sister can either fix the scooter and I'll take her to work until she can get it running or monday when she gets paid shell have to uber, take the bus, or the town club car to get to work. I will not take her anymore. My mother tells me I need to stop being an asshole and get the d*ck out of my ass. Shes my sister and my responsibility. My sister hears all this and is completely against it too and I cant help but feel it's because my mother puts her down so fast.

I cant help but feel it's not my responsibility. My mom wont be here forever and I'm not going to take care of my sister forever.  She has money saved and is capable of fixing it. She can handle having a stable job, managing money, in my mind this is the next step to her self reliance. Am I really the asshole in the situation? The scooter sounds the most realistic to me. An uber would cost her $2600 a year at the least as opposed to a hundred or more to fix a scooter."
837,cpzfao,"AITA for telling my gf she’s not allowed to eat sugary snacks in our bed anymore? Going to try and keep this to the point. My girlfriend is one of those people who loves curling up in bed and throwing a fluffy blanket over herself and watching tv. 

She also eats a LOT of snacks in bed. Popcorn, sugary doughnuts, chips, chocolate, cookies, you name it she’ll snack in bed. She works from home so as soon as she’s done with work she’ll crawl into bed and kind of ‘nest’. 

It’s been upsetting me majorly because she never dusts the bed down and there are ALWAYS. CRUMBS. On my side of the bed. It’s uncomfortable, gross, I dislike it, and I have asked her to stop multiple times. I was never raised to eat in bed so it’s weird for me. Each time she’s countered with ‘ok I’ll dust the bed down more thoroughly’ or ‘I’ll vacuum more often’ etc. 
As a method of deflecting what I’m asking. 

I work REALLY long shifts so whenever I come home I literally have a bite to eat and need to sleep. This kind of escalated last night because I came into bed and there were crumbs EVERYWHERE on my side. I pulled back my covers and there was sugary shit all over my damn bed. 

I ended up sleeping on the sofa because she was already asleep and I was too tired to dust everything down, and this morning I flat out told her that I no longer want her to eat in bed and it’s non negotiable. She thinks I’m being a mean controlling asshole, I think I’m not!"

I kept them in a safe place, took care of them, etc. One of them, a blue one with an unusual triangle face, caught the eye of The Bitch (called TB from here on), and at the time she tried to take it off me in a 'jokey' way, all 'oh, I really like this, can I keep it'.

Cut to today (not _actually_ today, but near enough.)

She comes round, does some cleaning, tidying up, etc. I'm not in the same room as her, so I don't see what she's doing, but at one point she comes out, and she's got my watch on- the blue one, with the triangle face. She's sort of doing that thing people do when they're trying to show something off subtly without actually doing it, so her wrist is sort of angled towards me, her arm toward me, all in my eyeline. I see she's got it on, and I'm like 'haha very funny TB I see you found it', and she's all 'I really like it, I'm keeping it'. I tell her it's mine, she says 'oh, it's only cheap, you can buy another one'.  
I tell her yeah, I know, but it's mine, and I'd really like to keep it. I look to my mum for help, who only says 'oh, it really suits you TB'. Next thing I know, there's money in front of me, and TB says 'there you go, you can buy yourself another one'. Before I can say or do anything, she's gone, with my- now 'her'- watch.

So naturally, I'm furious and upset about this. I've 'sold' a watch I never wanted to sell, and had absolutely no backup at all from my parents. I grouched the rest of the day, and got 'stop acting like a child, it's only a watch' and 'you can only buy another'.

The point is, it's not about the watch, but the principle; I had no backup at all, and I'm down a watch that I never wanted to get rid of, just because TB doesn't take no for an answer. I've reached out to her for it back, but only got 'you sold it to me, so it's mine'.

It's been a couple of days, and I'm still sort of stomping and grumping round the place all angry and upset. AITA for just wanting an apology or something?"
839,e8zgo2,"AITA for refusing in-laws to see my 1Y son? My in-laws have never accepted me. They live long distance so thankfully I've only had to see them a handful of times (I'd estimate 12 times in 6 years). Even with limiting visits, my mental health has suffered. Thanks to them I now suffer from anxiety and I ended up in the hospital with a panic attack. Just the thought of them gives me anxiety. Husband has anxiety, depression, panic attacks, and is a recovering alcoholic. This is all a result from their verbal and emotional abuse. Needless to say, they are not healthy to be around. I estimate that 90-99% of the things that come out of their mouths is for control. Anyway, last year I decided that I was done dealing with them. My mother-in-law raged at me after she couldn't control me into taking a family photo and she went through my entire house ""looking to see which of her presents we'd kept"". Since then, she has done nothing but covertly try to destroy my marriage. In her words, I'm out of control and my husband has to figure out a way to put me in check. She, of course, blames me for keeping her away from ""her grandchild"" as if she has some sort of right over him. She's done petty things like send me a birthday card 1.5 months late disguised as ""whoops, love you so much OP"", butt dial me, and text messages to guilt me into letting her see my son. FIL and SIL like to play along as the good cops, but the truth is they're all in on this. They have all at one point or another undermined my relationship. Unhappy people like company, I guess. For the last year, husband has mostly been on my side. However, husband has now started to guilt trip me as well. He acknowledges that his parents are a threat to our relationship, that they're never going to change, they'll never apologize, BUT he still thinks that our son has to have a relationship with them because it's important to him (husband). I think that's BS. It's my responsibility to protect my son from people (family or not) that are going to emotionally hurt him. As things stand, I am confident that's what would happen. If they abused their own son, why won't they abuse mine. Until things really change on their end, I will not allow son to have a relationship with them. In husbands eyes, I am an asshole. So am I?

Edit: Sorry, forgot to add the reason I'm even posting here. For the past year, JNMIL and other online forums have been my support system. Husband read from those same forums and ""learned a lot"". However, he is now accusing me of using verbiage from these same forums that are the result of ""very unhappy, sad people"". So I want to get an opinion from people that are neutral on the in-law issue."
840,ejtnlh,"AITA for forcing my husband to come with me to take our son to Urgent Care? I woke up this morning to my 3.5 month old son having diarrhea. I gave him some infant Tylenol and we both took a nap. Well at 1pm I woke up to him BURNING up and took his temperature which said 101.4 but it’s also a billion degrees upstairs in our house so I thought it was mostly overheating, so I gave him so more Tylenol and laid him downstairs where it is significantly cooler and took his temp after 10 minutes which read 98.7. This whole day he has been having diarrhea, being super lethargic and had a diaper with bloody mucusy stool in it so I decided we needed to take him to the Urgent Care up the street, I literally had to all but drag my husband out of bed at 7pm to make him come help me bring our kid as I was not going alone in case they had to send us to the ER. He told me he was not going just to hear a doctor say “he doesn’t feel good”. Well we got there and the doctor said he is a little worried because of the bloody mucus and and the lethargy so he orders a stool sample that we have to bring to the main hospital lab that is 30 minutes from our house. We are still waiting for those results and probably won’t get them until the morning as it’s after midnight here. 

So AITA for making my husband come with me when he didn’t want to?"
841,an3chd,"AITA for asking my landlord to fix damages left by the previous tenant before he got his deposit back? I just moved into a room in a house of five total people, all in their twenties. The guy who was in my room before me had been there for over seven years and is moving to another part of the city.  All of the other roommates are good friends with him. The guy asked me before I moved in if I wanted him to leave any of the furniture he had so we could both avoid having to move too much furniture. I came over, looked at the room, and asked him to leave the bed frame and the desk only. When I got home, I sent him an email stating that we had agreed to only leave the bed frame and the desk so we could have it in writing what the agreement was and he sent me back an e-mail agreeing.


When I moved in a few days ago, he had left the bed frame and the desk, but also a mattress, broken TV, lamp, and rug. The room was filthy—like I ran my finger along the windowsill and it came up black with dirt—and there are tons of nails in the walls, holes where nails were, and large parts where paint had been chipped away. The curtains were also filthy and had been in the same position for so long that they had become warped and I couldn’t move them along the runner or cover the entire window. These spots had all been hidden by wall coverings when I saw the room initially. I had to spend several hours cleaning up the room before I could move my stuff in.


One of my new roommates asked how the move was going and I said truthfully that I was frustrated with the state that the last guy had left the room in. She got a little uncomfortable and said that she had seen him trying to clean the room and he had gotten rid of a lot of stuff before moving (but obviously not all the stuff we had agreed on him moving before...) When I mentioned the problems with the curtains and the wall, she mentioned that I should submit a request to our landlord and he would paint the walls and add in some blinds and that he had done the same thing for her when she moved in.


So I submitted the requests and I figured that would be the end of it. After I do so, I notice the rest of my roommates immediately starting to ice me out. Finally one of them tells me that the landlord had sent an email earlier in the day asking if there were any damages that the previous tenant needs to pay and because I submitted the request, they think he’s probably going to not get part of the deposit back. I did not receive the email. The roommates think it was a dick move because he’s a nice guy and I should have waited awhile before sending in a request so he could get his deposit back first.


My attitude is that if he wanted his deposit back, he should have thought of that before he fucked up the walls. And leaving all his junk behind didn’t exactly make me all that favorable to him already. But my roommates all pretty clearly think I’m the asshole. AITA for immediately complaining to the landlord?"
842,bfpl50,"WIBTA if I didn’t acknowledge my mother-in-law for Mother’s Day? I have been distancing myself from my MIL over the past 2 years as her behaviour has steadily grown worse. She is a massive Trump supporter and is every bit of all the worst stereotypes that go along with it.

She turns *everything* political. You can’t even comment on the weather without her turning it into something about how liberals, “illegals,” homosexuals, and Muslims are ruining the country. I wish I was exaggerating, but I’m not. 

She never stops yammering on about how “white Christians are the most persecuted group to have ever existed” and it comes up in every. Single. Conversation.

Every year we send her expensive flowers for Mother’s Day but I really just don’t want to anymore. Not in a petty, vindictive way. I just can’t be bothered, really, to put in the effort this year. I don’t feel inclined to make the effort as her hateful and alienating behaviour puts me off of doing anything nice for her. 

And I don’t plan on ringing her up to wish her a happy Mother’s Day, either (my SO will likely ring her but I won’t be in on the call when he does). Other than her political and religious beliefs, she can be an okay person, but the problem is, she has made these things the core of her identity, so it’s difficult to separate the hateful things she says with the person she is when she’s not spouting off these beliefs.

So, WIBTA if I didn’t acknowledge my mother-in-law on Mother’s Day?"
843,cxy1k2,"AITA for telling my wife ""there's nothing such as your house"" ok, this might be a long story, so let's get some stuff out the way, also, im not a native english speaker, so please excuse any writing errors

1) this is my 2nd wife, first wife passed away a bit over 3 years ago

2) i had 3 kids with my past wife, 2 of which are now in college in our home country (egypt), i had no kids with my current wife

3) i don't live in egypt, im working in ksa, my wife and 3rd child live in ksa with me, we do go to egypt on vacations

4) our house in egypt is big, 2 living rooms, 2 doors, etc. it sort of looks like 2 houses, with a small hallway between the 2 living rooms, however, we usually have the hallway room open as we do move between the 2 living rooms alot (houses are NOT separated)

5) People involved : M - me
                                    W - wife
                                    SIL - sister in law
                                    C - children (ones in egypt)


so, W needed to get some papers from our room back in egypt, she had left the keys with SIL when we last went, so SIL took the keys and went to house (SIL does not live near us), C were sitting at home, and heard movement in the other living room, which scared them, but they decided to check it out, it was SIL, She got the papers and decided to stay for 2 days as her home is far, no problem, house is big, besides she's my SIL, so there's no issue w her staying

now during those 2 days, she was going around like there's no one in the house, refusing to eat with C, (always bought/made her own food), barely talked to them, and most of the time kept the hallway door closed (locked w a key)

naturally, C got annoyed by that, when i talked to W about it, and told her that SIL should have informed C that she was coming instead of just getting in without anyone's knowledge, and shouldn't have locked the hallway door, as C sometimes go to the other living room (honestly didn't care if she didn't wanna interact w C, if she doesn't want to, it's wrong to force an interaction)

W took it really personal, her main point was ""why should my sister ask your kids for permission to get into my house, or lock a door in it""

to which i responded to with ""there's nothing such as your house! this is everyone's house, your sister should've respected that there are people in that house, she should inform them, not ask for permission, and she shouldn't lock doors for no reason, as it's  a really gesture""

she didn't even respond, she just said ""i need a break"" and left

am i being an a-hole here

was i wrong for getting upset at what SIL did??"
844,bgz0x5,"AITA for refusing to cook for my wife? Throwaway because my wife knows my account. TLDR at the end, I know this is long.

My wife and I have been married for 3 years now and together for 6 in total, for some context. Lately (these last 6months-ish?) she's been trying my food, picking around it, and throwing most of it away. Now I'm not a chef, and sometimes my first time cooking something can turn out horribly and be replaced with take-out, and I get those. But lately it's been just about everything I cook even if it's something I know tastes good to most people. My brother eats with us often and likes my food. 

The thing is, my wife grew up in a family with middle-eastern culture, and therefore, their food. I grew up in southwest Texas. So has always told me that my food ""has no taste"", and then will subtly eat microwave chicken strips or pizza rolls after she eats none of it at dinner time. I tried fixing this, and found recipes and recipes online and got a massive spice/herb collection in the meantime. I also learned recipes hands-on from her family. Still the same thing, ""it has no taste, but that doesn't mean I don't like it!"", then she picks around it, throws it away, and eats something from a package. 

On top of the food she is used to from growing up, she doesn't eat beans, soup/stew, brown rice, anything whole wheat, seafood, pork that isn't bacon, beef, or venison. All because she doesn't like them, not for a religous/cultural/health reason. I respected that, and over the years learned to stretch chicken breast recipes out thin, because I'm not left with much. That's fine. But now the seasoning stuff? I got tired of it. Now I'm cooking steak, brisket, seafood, whatever I feel like eating/serving to company as I please. Her family likes my food, and so does mine. She also will never request something specific, and doesn't cook.

She has noticed this I started this over the last couple weeks, and is now making remarks when I tell her what's for dinner such as ""So you're just cooking for you tonight?"" and then storming off and eventually eating the same pizza-rolls/ramen she does anyway. I always make enough for her in case she changes her mind. I've heard her complain to her friends who totally agree with her being rightfully upset. AITA?

TL;DR: My wife doesn't like my food, and is pretty picky as well. I got sick of it and started cooking whatever I want and leaving her to fend' for herself. Her friends think she's rightfully upset about this. AITA?"
845,al6igx,"AITA for shutting off a form and creating a new document Hey!

So, I'm in high school and I run a club along with another person who we'll call D. This club has a subcommittee which is run by N and M. The club handles a school-wide competition of sorts, and everyone in my grade is involved in this nomination and voting process. We have some reservations about N and M running it, but we leave them to it. We ask them to send us the final voting form before they send it out, and they don't do so. 

Immediately, we see some discrepancies in the form. More specifically, there was a category that we agreed to take out because it would be incredibly controversial that they put back in by themselves and also generated all of the nominations in that category by themselves (all other nominations were created by the student body), and they took out a category that we agreed to include and refused to tell us why they did. We tell them that we removed the controversial one, but then D and I examine the form even more closely and discover that there were serious problems with who was nominated. Firstly, we always email the people on the form to determine if they were comfortable with their nomination. This did not happen, and a lot of people were upset that they were nominated into specific categories that they were explicitly not comfortable with. Secondly, there were people with many nominations that were outright left out of the form which wasn't fair to them. Thirdly, the majority of the people on the form were in the friend group of N and M. This, coupled with the fact that multiple people came to us and said that both N and M were bragging amongst themselves about rigging the form during multiple classes, made us very wary of what they had made.

Due to all of the problems with the form, we shut it off because it was too problematic to keep it open, and we also didn't trust the both of them to deal with the form in an unbiased way - especially because both of them have a history of behavior like this. We work to recount the nominations and drop all of the recounted numbers in a shared document. On the top, there's a paragraph outlining the methodology of how we made the form. 

N and M see this and get very mad. They say we need to meet after school on a day to discuss. We were initially going to talk to them about it after the weekend, but we figured it couldn't hurt to discuss it at that point. So, they start getting mad at us for not telling them about how we closed the form, how it hurt that we recounted all of the numbers, and how we supposedly are ""making up rumors about them"". We explained the reason why we did everything that we did, but they wouldn't budge.

AITA for shutting off this form and recounting the numbers in a new document?"
846,e21r4p,"AITA For Losing My Temper at my Roommate? I'm a college student, and I share a room with... Let's call her Elaina. Elaina likes to sing. A lot. She also isn't from the US, and her family's daytime is often when I'm trying to go to sleep.

Elaina usually calls her family around this time. Loudly. And she likes to show them whatever new song she's working on or just chatter about her day while her phone is at max brightness about six feet from my face. 

I'll admit that I should have said something a lot sooner, but one night I'd just had enough. I had a test the next day in a class I am failing, and I needed to sleep so I'd be well rested for it. I told her as much, and was ignored. Finally, I snapped.

I'm a 23-year-old that has no car or license. This means I rely on my parents to take me to and from school. They charge $200 for rent each month and they're fine with that covering for my food, phone, gas, internet, so on and so forth. This is a REALLY great deal and I am so thankful to have my parents. They've treated me very well since I was born and I also treat them when I have the means, as a way to give back you know?

Here's what happened yesterday. Their couch and bed need to be replaced. I say need because they're retired and sit around all day, couple this with their health issues and it has to be done. They come to me and ask for money. I very rarely spend my money because I pay $200 on rent, $358 on insurance, and $180 on a therapist. I make roughly $1,000 a month (I get paid to go to school) so that leaves me with roughly $262. Barely having anything leftover and the fact that I am scared to touch my money I often have some just sitting in my bank account.

Couch and bed will cost them $2,000 and they still also asked for $200 in rent for this month. Me, being the little bitch I am, was too scared to say no so I simply said ""sure"" and gave them the money. I had the money to give but...looking at that $2,200 gone from my account isn't a great feeling. I tried to make it something positive like, ""Happy early Christmas!"" and that worked fine until today.

Today they needed money for gas...and they wanted to get food on the way back for us. They asked for $100 and I started to mention how I'll need $75 to take an exam at my university two weeks from now (nowhere near payday) and they got angry at me. They started to talk about how I should always have money saved up and they pointed out two video games I bought in the last three months. I thought it'd be fine to buy those games since I had more than enough money but they took the money I thought I could fall back on.

They eventually stated they would barr me from eating any food they bought so I caved in and handed them $100.

$200 a month for a place to sleep, do laundry, food, utilities etc. is the best deal anyone could ever have. At this point I'm a mooch so I feel like I'm in the wrong for being hesitant to give my parents of all people money.

I just don't know what to feel...Am I the asshole?

Edit: I had some people send me messages offering me money in relation to the exam I have to take. I appreciate it but I'm not comfortable accepting money from anyone. Consider donating it to a charity of your choice instead."

I told him it was no problem and sent him a text letting him know I was going to take my girlfriend to see the movie with me.

I didn't hear from him for 48 hours after this, not a hey, no question as to how the movie was, nothing. All the while he's logging onto the online dating site and messaging other people (one being my friend who recognized his photo from our chat about it)

So today I messaged him saying flat out that there are better ways of communicating and that I hope he finds what he's looking for and that I don't want to beat around the bush or waste someones time who isn't interested. 

His response was along the lines of ""You're not even going to ask if I'm okay? I had a chaotic weekend but I'm not going to explain it now. I was going to apologize but you texted me first so good luck""

It irked me, on one hand I'm like, yeah I kinda cut it short and sweet, but on the other hand I feel lied to, like you had such a chaotic weekend you only had time to message other women?

My step brother Daniel and my best friend Erica have been together for two years and just got engaged. They met through me - Daniel's dad and my mom got married a few years ago and Erica has been my best friend since high school. 

Daniel liked Erica the moment he met her, but Erica has liked another guy, her co-worker James, since before he met Daniel. However, James is married so Erica kept her distance. When she started dating Daniel I thought that it was a good thing for her and would help her forget about James. 

Daniel and Erica have always seemed very happy together, he spoils her and she is so sweet to him. Daniel was in a car accident a few months ago and Erica was the one who took care of him, and he said that's what made him decide to already propose to her. However, Erica has admitted to me in private that she still has feelings for James but accepted Daniel's proposal because he is the one who has always been there for her and she knows he will make a good husband and father. I asked her if she has considered talking to Daniel about it, but she just said that she has never done anything to hurt him when they were dating and she intends to keep it that way when they are married. 

I decided not to tell Daniel anything because it is not my relationship to be involved in, and I don't know what the goal would be for me to do that. If Erica wants to 'settle' for Daniel, as long as she is not cheating on her and Daniel is happy with her though nonethewiser, then that's on her. But sometimes when I try to put myself in Daniel's shoes and I feel bad that he is getting into something without knowing everything. I know that most of the time secrets are eventually found out and he will feel betrayed once he learns the truth.

She tasked my husband and I with the responsibility of getting estate agents in for a valuation etc as well as sprucing up her house that was stuck in the 70’s. So my husband and I have lived in her house for the last 6 months literally painting the house, we completely redone the kitchen, bathroom and garden, etc. It really feels like a personal project we’ve undertaken especially because we have a little 2 year old and it hasn’t been easy, but we did it as a favour to my mum. 

We finally got some estate agents around and first ones were really happy with the place. Said it was state of the art (my husband is a sparky so he literally wired the place up to be top spec) The second ones, a husband and wife team, came in and immediately started making disapproving facial expressions and talking amongst themselves. They were not an independent business, but they were representing a big UK brand. I let it go on for a little while, but as we moved around the house they’d converse in perfect English to my husband and I but then rapidly change to their language whilst pointing at things like the walls, bannisters, etc whilst making the aforementioned disapproving sounds. 

I couldn’t really stand the continued exclusion so I asked them ‘sorry, can you speak in English please?’ At which point the man said yes of course but the lady became visibly irritated. Obviously it’s a project we poured heart and soul into so we’d like to know the pros AND the cons to our faces!

He was given strong medications for his insomnia which also means he is barely coherent when he throws up on himself, the bed and sometimes on me. This used to occur once a month around 3 am and i would clean him up and put him back to sleep. It is now happening every other night and my sleep quality has gone to shit.

I wish it were mostly the former and not the latter, or even that it were 50/50, but it is not. 

This takes me to my main objection to having a wedding at all. There are a few people that both my fiancée and I agree we never, ever want to be allowed at our wedding, but seeing as the family has such an adamant policy on ""sticking together"" (even though most of the family absolutely hate each other and constantly say awful things about whoever isn't in the room) there is no way we can exclude anyone without having the collective wrath of the family brought down upon us. 

The biggest problems that I have with this fake image of perfection is that there is so much dirt in their laundry that you could use it as compost in the garden, and I am also routinely reminded that I'm not a 'real' part of the family and that my problems are my own without any hope of support or inclusion from them. 

We've talked about it at length, and my fiancée feels the same as I do, albeit to a lesser degree about her family (something about you don't have to like your family but sometimes you can't help but love them anyways). She has said she is happy to swing by the town hall or to elope somewhere, but I can see in her eyes how much it would really mean to have a small wedding. 

Still, I feel like a selfish asshole to want our wedding to be about us and I feel like we'd be letting many of our close friends and family members down to exclude everyone for the sake of minimizing our exposure to a few toxic people. It's also not easy for us to confront her family about how we feel since we both currently live in a different country from our families and are fairly non-confrontational people with a decent amount of social anxiety to boot. 

So Reddit, am I the asshole here?

855,dglspj,"AITA for farting on my boyfriend? I have been dating my boyfriend for a few months now and we met through our jobs. Not sure if it matter but he is my first boyfriend and we never had a fight before.  

 Last night we closed together and decided to go grab dinner at a Chevy's. I ended up ordering tacos but I am not a big fan of meat so I asked for extra beans with my rice so I could put them in my tacos. We also had a few drinks during the meal and so i was pretty tipsy. 

We had both been drinking so we decided to sit in the car for a little while before he drove us both home. Well, we ended up getting flirty and I sat on his lap and we started making out. I could feel pressure building up under me but I just ignored it because I'm usually pretty good at holding in my farts and what was I gonna do? Just stop everything to go outside for 5 seconds and fart? So i ignored it and well the pressure didn't go away...a fart just slipped out without me even letting it. It was pretty loud and I was really embrassed. My boyfriend just stopped and whispered ""what the fuck?"" and that just made me laugh uncontrollably and I couldn't stop farting no matter how hard I tried. I felt so embarassed and I kept saying sorry as I was laughing but I couldn't control my laugh or my farts. 

He just kept telling me to get off him and he was trying to get ot of the car. To be fair, it was really smelly and the windows were up so I get it. 

I didn't realize how upset he was until he got out of the car and slammed the door behind him. I was able to get a hold of myself and I opened the door and told him I was sorry but that I couldnt control myself. He told me that it was my fault for eating so many beans tonight and he kept yelling in the parking lot ""why the FUCK did you eat so many beans?"" I was really embrassed because there were families around walking to their cars from the Chevy's. 

He did end up calming down after he went for a walk around the lot. He drove me home in silence after that and once we got to my house he stopped the car and told me that it was really rude of me to fart on him but the part that made him angry was that i kept laughing about it and continued to fart on him instead of getting off of him right away and going outside. i told him i couldnt control myself because I am only human and he said he doesn't believe it and if i respected him i wouldnt have been laughing about it. 

I understand where he is coming from but I feel like he doesn't understand that I couldn't control anything and he thinks I was purposely disrespecting him. I dont know, I feel like most guys would have laughed about it or something then continued flirting. Like I really dont know if I am the asshole here or if he is over reacting because he is my first boyfriend and i never farted in front of a guy before. Please help, I dont have guy friends to ask besides my work friends but i dont want them knowing about this."
856,dry6i1,"AITA for refusing to be a co-borrower for my dad’s loan? —-full context here—-

My dad called me a few hours ago asking me if I can be a co-borrower for his loan just because he has to pay immediately my aunt for shouldering the contribution for the hospitalisation of my grandpa. 

I don’t have anything wrong against him or grandpa. But the problem is I cannot afford to repay the costs if ever dad fails to repay the loans, especially on time. I do have some financial obligations at the moment and I just moved to a new job after being laid off. I’m not in a financial state to cover for my dad if ever he fails to pay. 

I’m also sceptical of my dad considering he sometimes ends up paying late for my brother’s college tuition. (In our country this is the norm— parents pay tuition of their kids till college) I also doubted the legitimacy of the loaning agent — although upon searching it does seem legitimate. I also don’t trust my dad that much in a financial sense because my brother had to shoulder the cost of my (part of the curriculum) college educational trips. 

He’s adamant he will repay it on time and he thinks I don’t trust him that he’ll repay the loan and I ask too many questions. 

I feel guilty because I know he’s borrowing money just to make sure he can pay aunt for shouldering the hospital costs for grandpa. We do want grandpa to recover and get better. He cannot rely on my brother as he’s a full time student. But I can’t be a co-borrower considering my financial state and my doubts towards him repaying the debt on time. 

Was I right in refusing to be a coborrower for my dad’s loan? Or am I an asshole for being insistent on not being the coborrower even if my dad thinks I’m the only one who can do it for him?"
857,eeaigo,"WIBTA for sending an angry text to my roommates for pulling out on rooming for next year So, me and two close friends of mine (who happen to be two of my three current roommates at college) and I have been looking at apartments for months to live in the next fall semester. A lot of online searching and going to check out the aparements irl was done and we had decided on a place and were preparing to sign a lease. Then right as I finish finals the night before I go home (which is out of state) they tell me that they decided to live in an apartment complex that only has up to two rooms and they no longer are going to live with me. They said it would just be easier for them to do (despite the fact that what just the two of them living together would be more expensive). I was in absolute shock at the time because of other family circumstances they were aware of so I lacked the emotional capacity to fully take this in. I felt I had to just say ok and I went with it because what else could I do? They made this decision behind my back because they never mentioned once that they were considering this option. I felt blindsided and didn't really know what to do. So later once I was home I sent them a polite text message explaining to them how the left me hanging to either pay double my originally anticipated rent to live by myself or live with strangers. I also said the timing right before I left for a month long break and lack of transparity throughout the whole process really upset me. They both replied they were sorry and they'd help me look for a living situation and that they had just recently decided to do this. However, their response felt half assed and I am still really angry with them because this is the second time they pulled out on something important like this. Earlier this year they both offered to have me for Thanksgivings and I accepted one of their offers and then 4 weeks before Thanksgiving they pulled out and so I told the other roomie I would take up her offer and then she pulled out 3 weeks before Thanksgiving which left me as an out of state student SOL.

So I decided to buy myself a car so I can have better life quality, in terms of sleeping a little more and have more mobility. 
My gf asked me today if I could drop her at work fora month. This would mean that not only I would have to wake up earlier than before (I used to get up at 6:45 and taking her would mean waking up at 5:45), but it would take me more time to go to work, as I would have to drop her 25 minute aways from, and then 35 minute without traffic ( there is always traffic, meaning would be 1 hour more)

859,ax1fso,"AITA for not wanting to recreate my fiancé's parent's motorcycle trip honeymoon? It's great they did it but it's not what I want. Posting from a throwaway for reasons. 

Background: I am engaged to be married in August. My fiancé's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. 

Apparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fiancé apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fiancé was like ""aren't you so happy?""

I told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way.

860,aey6au,"AITA for asking reddit if my bf r*ped me? Kinda tw soooooo this was ages ago but I still don't get it. My boyfriend (now ex boyfriend...) and I had a HUGE argument that led to him dumping me and literally never speaking to me again. This was because he found out I had posted to r/ relationships and asked if the first time we had sex was rape or not. He somehow found my account and found the post and confronted me about it, I admitted it was me. 

My intention for doing this wasn't to ""falsely accused him of rape"" as he says I was doing. I was genuinely confused because when the situation I asked for advice about happened, I was 16 and had never done anything sexual. Basically I was crying and trying to break up with him and he started doing sexual stuff. I did say yes at first but after I felt so bad because I didn't know my first time would involve a bunch of rough sex and face slapping choking, degrading names etc etc. (more things, won't go too in depth) I did express that it hurt but didn't say no. 

He says that I'm trying to get him to be the bad guy and that I have a victim mentality. He said I was an asshole psychopath out to get him and that he was gonna stay the fuck away from me.

I had tried to bring it up to him but he didn't wanna discuss it, that's why I posted about it online instead. Also I don't think he raped me, and I was never ever considering putting him in any real trouble I just wanted to try to figure out what happened.

862,btyai7,"AITA for being upset and offended with my sisters for trying to set me up with girls I'd never be interested in? Until recently, for the past three years (I'm in my early 20s) I've been single.  I  was dating this whole time, but no one really stood out to me.  I wasn't unhappy or anything and I never complained to my 2 sisters about it.

&#x200B;

Around December last year my sisters started trying to ""set me up.""   I didn't mind at first because I could just turn down anyone I wasn't interested in.  Between then and now, they tried to set me up with 4 different women.

&#x200B;

The first girl was my cousin's longtime friend who I know for a fact cheated in basically every relationship she's been in.  The second was a single mother of 2. The third girl had to have been like 250 lbs, and the last girl was 5 months pregnant.  I wasn't physically attracted to any of them.

&#x200B;

The pathetic thing is this really affected my self esteem.  When I was in a charitable mood I thought that they thought I'd be good for them and even then I kind of felt upset that they'd prioritize their friends over me.  When I wasn't I thought my sisters just thought I'd have to find whoever'd take me.

a week after the last ""blind date"" with the pregnant girl I randomly met and I felt like something clicked and we've been together for 3 weeks, up to now.

This week one of my sisters complained about how I had wasted her time trying to set me up, lightheartedly.  This eventually started an argument with them where I told them how I felt insulted based on the girls they tried to set me up with and they insinuated I was sexist.  They even made a point of bringing up my girlfriend's age (We're only three years apart) like I was some kind of predator.

My mom went through breast surgery to remove what the doctor's described as a Stage 0 growth (it was caught pretty early), the surgery was a success and the next stage is radiation treatment in the following months. Now post-op she has been ""cradling"" her arm on the side where the surgery was done and recovery has been slow the past weeks, but she isn't bed-ridden or anything. The doctor has been giving her instructions not to ""baby"" it and to keep moving and performing simple exercises to strengthen it daily.   


My mom has been telling me about how things have been tough since the surgery because I've started working and she's alone in the house (the rest of the family is either out at work or in university) with nothing to do except exercise and rest since we take care of the rest of the chores and stuff. She would tell me how she gets episodes of what she claims is depression and panic attacks because of the slow recovery and pain from the arm. Now this was pretty rich coming from her because previously my sister was suffering from diagnosed depression for some time and is now better in college but when it first manifested my Mom scolded her saying it was ""all in her head"" and that there was nothing wrong with my sister (eventually she did relent and my sister got professional help). My mom would also make nasty comments about mentally handicapped people in church that back in her day they would either be not allowed in the building or would be outside or close to the back to keep out of sight.

864,ak6zkl,"AITA for wanting to turn captions on when everyone else hates them? basically, i have an Auditory Processing Disorder that (sometimes) makes it difficult for me to process spoken word. I can hear perfectly fine and I understand that words are being said, but sometimes I am unable to understand spoken word as anything more than a jumble of noises. I’m totally fine 80% of the time, but some days are definitely worse than others and accents, background noise, and volume level can make it harder for me. It often takes a lot of concentration to understand every word being said to me. 

Anyway: 

I usually turn on captions when I’m watching stuff. Some people in my family HATE the captions and will go as far as to complain about it while turning them off. They really seem genuinely bothered by the captions: “It ruins comedy for me if I read the punch line first.” “It distracts me from the show and I can’t enjoy it.” I know that tons of people seem to be similarly annoyed by captions or feel that it ruins their experience, but sometimes I just *cannot* understand what the hell is going on if I don’t have captions on, so it really sucks for me when they’re off. 





So, AITA for wanting captions on when I’m watching stuff with other people even though everyone else seems to hate them/feel it ruins their experience? I always feel pretty bad about it knowing that the other person watching with me is probably annoyed with the captions, so I only ever put them on if I’m watching alone.

865,bnpujr,"AITA for telling my cousin she shouldn’t get a dog after she asked my to DOGSIT said dog? Context. My cousin just finished her junior year of high-school and is very busy. She has a boyfriend and does lots of after school activities and is hardly home.  (She is amazing btw but) 

She is a MAJOR animal lover which I think is amazing as I am as well. However she really wants to get a dog (preferably a puppy as she puts it) and has asked me to babysit the dog during the day occasionally, while she goes to school etc. I flat out told her to not get the dog. Her track record with past dogs is not the best and I think she should wait until after college so she can actually care for the dog properly. 

Just to be clear I think it is very important to adopt dogs as many are in shelters and need homes.  (I have an amazing rescue myself) 

She would be pushing this dog onto her mother who is currently looking for a job. She says that her mother is home and can care for the dog with no problems.

However she wants to bring a hyperactive puppy into a home where she won’t be there very often and then push it on me? Am I the asshole for telling her flat out  no? Some examples of precious pets below...


(Her last dogs story)
They had a dog whose name was Lola. She was a smaller dog and they would just leave her home all day and put a doggy diaper on her as they were never home. Eventually they didn’t want the dog anymore and gave it up.

So I'm(24NB) an atheist, and my family hasn't always been supportive of that. Which is weird cause we never really went to church or anything growing up, but as soon as my family found out my mother and sister started putting religious pressure on me. And they are genuinely nice people but there were a few points where they got super mad at me, yelled at me, tried to guilt trip me. Whatever I'm chill and face them down calmly while they yell or fume or whatever and now they don't push the issue anymore. One incident does stick out in my mind though.

So my nephew(Probably about 4 at the time) was going to get some kind of blessing thing from the church. It's worth noting my sister converted to her husbands brand of christianity and so I had no clue what this would be. Of course my whole family is invited because we love the little booger and wanna support him so the fact that . So we go to this church we've never been to. I sit through a half hour of this church service. They got a guitar and sing about Jesus. Ok fine. They talk about having used the power of faith to heal people from stuff including HIV. Ok not so fine.

Finally my nephew comes out of wherever they keep the little kids during church service, he went on stage and got a piece of paper from the priest and people clapped. Priest says some nice words and congratulates him and then my nephew walks off back into wherever the kids are. People start singing and playing guitar again. I realize, oh fuck this wasn't a special service to just do the blessing thing for people, that was like 2 minutes tops, this is gonna be another hour and a half of them singing about Jesus.

So I excuse myself from where we were sat in the 2nd row of a large and full church and calmly walk out. Because hey I was there for my nephew, and he's not even in the main room anymore so I've fulfilled my family support. I leave. Told my dad I was leaving and left and wander around the neighborhood looking for something to do til they finish up. Eventually my sister starts texting me extremely angry and insulted that I walked out of church. I told her I was there for my nephew and don't believe in god so I didn't want to be there any more. And that began an argument where she felt I should have stayed and listened and sat through the whole service, and I felt I didn't need to because I didn't see a reason to want to stay. This isn't like a parent leaving the talent show after their kid goes. This is a 2 hour church service which was briefly paused by my nephews short ceremony.

So Am I the Asshole for not sitting through the whole service? I realize I probably broke a social norm to walk out of a church service, but I'm pretty sure that the rest of my family and the 400 strangers didn't care."

869,eofgcq,"WIBTA for keeping my full new name a secret from my mother? (resubmitted for exceeding character limits) English is my second language so sorry in advance.

I (20M) am a trans man (be civil reddit) and have been out for 5 years. My mother didn't react well to my coming out, not at all. Our biggest fight was always and still is about my name (lets say James* ). I told her we could search together for a new name for me, so that she feels involved in this process. James is pretty similar to one she suggested, I thought that would make her happy. *narrator: she was not happy*

When I told her the Name she flipped out, crying and shouting how 'James' is horrible and why would I even want to change the name she gave me, that I must not love her to do that to her and how hard it was to her, everything like that. I always feel really shite afterwards and I stopped trying to discuss it with her

That was 5 years ago. Mum has never used my name, not once. At first she just kept referring to me as J[old name], then dropped a name altogether and only said 'child'. Then she created a 'nickname' for me that is just my old name with one letter changed. I am not happy with it but try to not complain because it obviously is still very hard for her and at last i feel like a person again.

What my mum doesn't know: When searching for a name I had a few names I liked, and I wanted to name myself something different at first, Jean Luc* . I liked Jean Luc actually better than James but went with James to try to please my mum too. After I moved out I decided 'fuck it! I like that name too and I want it too' so I added it as my second name.

Now: I have all the documents at home to start the process of legally changing my name to make me officially 'James Jean Luc [last name]'. I don't plan on telling her this. I don't think she deserves to know about it, and I don't want to put up with the fight it will cause if I told her. I also feel that Jean Luc is the one part of my identity she hasn't get 'dirty', she can't insult this part of me if she doesn't know about it. So I want to keep it 'pure', if that makes sense.

But in all other areas my mother has greatly improved since last year. She went to her first pride parade with me and to a book reading of a trans author. She started reading books about this topic even tho she usually doesn't read. I helped her get in contact with a self help group for parents of trans children. She refers to me as her son and uses male pronouns. And she comes to terms that I medically transition too, offering to drive me to and from the hospital when the time comes. 

My friend group is split on this topic. They all understand why I feel that way. But now they think I should tell her about my full name. I know that my mother is working on herself and that she feels bad for not being able to accept me but sometimes I like that she feels bad about it and want her to continue to feel bad. Am I too harsh with her? I want some objective perspectives here.

I just kinda brushed it off and pulled my shorts down a little and just kept playing with my cat. Later, he kept bringing it up and I was getting uncomfortable. And LAST NIGHT. Don't get me started on LAST NIGHT. He decided to mention it again and took it into his own hands to pull my shorts lower. I snapped and told him to leave me alone, and that if he's uncomfortable then just tell me to wear longer pants. I also told him that I was getting uncomfortable with him. After that, he gave me a lecture about respecting him and his authority, which in my opinion, didn't really apply to the situation. I haven't talked to him since, but my mom says I'm being sensitive.

871,d7l5mz,"AITA for asking a girl in a shared dorm not to use her hairdryer? So I slept in a 4 bed shared girls dorm in a hostel last night. I woke up this morning at 9 am because the girl in the bunk below me started blow drying her hair in her bed. Because I wanted to sleep in a little more, I asked her if she would consider drying her hair in the bathroom, where I’d seen other people dry their hair, instead of in the shared dorm. I thought it was a reasonable request, but she got pretty annoyed. She said that I should expect this kind of a thing when I book a bed in a shared dorm, especially since it was already 9 am and “time to wake up”. She said that if I wanted a quiet room I should have gotten a private one.

Now, I expect some noise when I sleep in a shared dorm, and I don’t mind people making noise by packing, getting ready, etc. I agree that if you pay less to share a room, you can’t expect silence during the night or the morning. I always bring earplugs and am prepared for the usual morning sounds. However, a blow dryer is really loud, and it’s a difficult sound to drown out. The hostel has a large bathroom area with plenty of space, so it would have been easy for her to do it outside. My take on hostel etiquette is that it’s okay to make some noise while going to sleep, getting things from your locker, preparing for the day, packing, etc, as long as you’re considerate of the other people in the dorm and maybe try to be a little more quiet than you would be in your own apartment. It’s about being a nice person. For example, I went to bed pretty late, and had prepared everything earlier in the day so I would be as quiet as possible when I came back to the dorm at night. Therefore I thought it would be okay to ask her to quiet down. I also don’t think it’s unreasonable to want to sleep past 9 am on a Sunday morning after a party.

She did stop using it and I thanked her, but she seemed pretty annoyed. I kind of understand her arguments, although I don’t think you should always do something “just because you have the right to”. But since I see both sides, I am a little torn about how much of an asshole I was. Because I was didn’t have any friends with me, I thought I would go to the almighty Reddit. So Reddit, AITA?"

My roommate(one of my girlfriends and I’s best friends) and another mutual friend said they were leaving to get Burger King. My girlfriend and I were trying to do the deed one last time before she left to head back to her school today. As soon as he left I texted him, “Hey text me when you’re headed back, and take your time eating we kinda need some alone time.”

He didn’t reply but I knew he saw it, so my girlfriend and I got right to it. And in the chaos of it, my phone went off which I didn’t notice. He said he needs to come back to get his notebooks to study. Then he said they were at the door. I didn’t see it going off until my girlfriend and I finished. I texted him apologizing and saying you can head back to the room. 

He then said, they bailed because the bed was squeaking and we were kinda loud. I was mortified but just said alright well come back whenever.

He then sent in a Snapchat group that I was in with some other friends a video of him out the door where you can *CLEARY* hear my girlfriend and I going at it. It was meant to be a joke but we didn’t take it it well.

My girlfriend is relatively new to sex(she lost her virginity to me not long ago at all) and gets really anxious about things like sex. So she freaked out and started crying. So I freaked out on my roommate and cussed him out pretty bad and said if he comes back in the room anytime soon I’m clocking him in the jaw. 

We made up and everything is okay now between us, but now we’re disagreeing to if I overreacted or if he seriously just crossed a line.

Basically my friend had her birthday party on a saturday (she had already had her birthday before and made quick plans for this a week before the event). My boyfriend was going to paris with his sister to celebrate his birthday the same day which i had no problem with. 

Then he told me he wouldnt be going anymore and i immediately cancelled my plans with my friend since he would now be having a birthday party on the same day. I told him this and he told me if i wanted to, i could go to my friends party and that he didnt mind. i told him i would think about it and eventually decided to go to my friends party and the next day we could do something together alone since he wasnt doing anything special at the party (just drinking with friends which he does literally every other weekend). And i wouldnt have missed his birthday since his birthday is on sunday. I would have just missed the party.

He then proceeded to get mad at me and told me it was an easy decision and because he is my boyfriend i shouldve just came to his party instead of going to my friends and that all his friends girlfriends were coming and he wanted me to be there too. In the end i went, had fun and everything was good.

Issue: I expressed to to my husband that I'd like to walk at my graduation ceremony next year. He basically said this was silly because 1) it's a master's and you've already walked for your undergrad 2) it's an online program. Not gonna lie...I'm more hurt than pissed, said as much and I don't think he cares since he's downstairs playing a computer game. My thoughts are that this is a big deal to me because I've worked hard and juggle several things each day while he primarily goes to work and then back home. I also think it would be good for our kids to see because they see me studying and know that we're not taking trips this year due to my school schedule. Seeing the 'pomp and circumstance' may positively motivate them as they get older. The graduation will be several states away, but money and travel time is not an issue.

My relationship with my mother has been off and on for years because she tends to gravitate toward the drama caused by my horrible sibling. Our relationship, with some issues here and there was pretty good; however, most recently, my daughter (who is white) was dating a black kid. Nice kid, we had him over all the time, he spoiled her. I told my mother about him because kiddo put photos of the two of them all over social media, but it was agreed that we keep it on the DL from mother's husband (technically not anymore but that's a long story), because he is a super racist. We're talking ""disowned his own daughter/has never met his grandchildren by her because she married a black man"" racist. 

Anyway, my mother calls me one day out of the blue on speaker phone and just randomly asks, ""I have a question and I want an honest answer. Does (daughter's name) have a boyfriend?"" 

I'm like, ""Well, she did, they broke up a couple of days ago. Why?"" And in the pit of my stomach, I knew what was coming next. 

Then she asked exactly what I knew she would, ""What color is he?"" 

I replied, ""He's black. Why? Is there an issue? I know there's not one here, because we're not racist in my household."" Then, I added, ""What was the point of this exactly? To ensure that (insert mother's husband's name here) hates (daughter)? Thanks for betraying the only grandchild who wanted anything to do with you."" (I wish this last part was a lie. None of the other grandkids want anything to do with her. My daughter was the only one.)

876,bskcir,"AITA for asking my husband to make a long commute more than once a week My husband was recently transferred to a work location about 2 hours from where we live. I am a graduate student in the last stage of my PhD so moving now would be 4 years of wasted work. Currently we have a two bedroom apartment for us and our daughter in our town, and he has a studio in the new city (this was cheaper than just a two bedroom in the city). When he moved, we arranged for his parents to help me out during the week and for him to come home on weekends. He is looking for a new job in our town, but this is the situation at the moment.

The issue was that the weeks were really hard for me. It felt like I was co parenting with his parents and that’s not what I signed up for. I barely felt married with our initial arrangement. It was just way too much for me and I asked him to come home Wednesday or Thursday nights and make the commute 1-2 times per week instead of just coming home on the weekends. He agreed to this and this has been our set up for a few weeks, with his parents still helping me out for the first half of the week.

His parents are really upset with me for asking him to make this change. They have been very vocal about the fact that they think I’m being selfish by asking him to take this commute and that I should’ve been fine with just their help and I should’ve been grateful for the situation we had going before. My husband tells me they’re wrong, but he’s a very selfless person and I’m stressed that I’m bulldozing him into something he doesn’t really want to do for my own benefit, and it’s making me feel really guilty. Am I an asshole for asking my husband to make the change and commute more for my own benefit?

Okay, so I am a big fan of Seinfeld as I used to watch it every day after school with my dad. I had a poster that was signed by the actors who played the four main characters Jerry, Kramer, Costanza, and Elaine. This poster has always been really important to me because watching seinfield with my dad is one of the few times I got to spend time with him (he had a lot of personal issues) and he personally went and got it signed to give me for my 21st birthday. So yeah, it's not just a dumb poster to me, it has a lot of sentimental value.

Now my wife and I have been trying to raise money to start a college fund for our kids. As you do, we've been selling stuff we don't need anymore, and I guess you can see where this is going. I hadn't been in my study a few weeks as I've been on an extended business trip, and when I come home to my study my poster is gone. I ask my wife where it is and she said she sold it on eBay.

Here's where it gets iffy. She claims she assumed it would be okay to sell since it's just a poster, DESPITE it being so sentimental to me. The reason I am suspect is because she was very unhappy with me going on this business trip. She tried to forbid me going because she couldn't come with me (to make sure I behave myself). However I couldn't say no, I literally had to go or I'd severely hurt my reputation at work. So when I leave we're fighting, when I come back my most prized possession is gone in a ""mistake."" See where I'm coming from?

I told my wife I was going to stay in a motel for 1-2 weeks, and that if she wants to save this marriage my poster better be back in my study when I get back. She's supposedly been an emotional wreck ever since (according to her sister).

AITA? My friends think I am having a hissy fit and need to grow up"
878,ee0nn4,"AITA For misconstruing ghosting? About a month ago I nervously entered a friend's with benefits situation with someone who I have liked romantically for about 6 years (the timing was never right during school). Now that we are both adults we thought it could be fun to have to strings attached sex and, me being the type of guy to want to make someone happy even if it means jeopardizing my own happiness, told her to give me a week to compartmentalize my feelings toward her.

A week goes by and I've done the best I could. I'm still nervous as hell at this point because I hadn't been with a woman in over two years. She was a little tipsy that night and told me (while she was sober) that she was gonna come over after a little wine. She came over, I had about two shots of whiskey, and we engaged in some premarital coitus. End of story.

For the next few days I was going over to my friends' house and we would get high and have a good time. My FWB would get drunk every night and would always snapchat me while wasted and horny, but she never asked for sex again because I was too high to drive home for it.

We didn't have sex for the next week and a couple days because the thought really never crossed my mind. If it did I rationalized that I should wait a bit because I didn't compartmentalize hard enough and I was still left wanting a relationship.

After exactly two weeks of talking every night but no sex she texted me saying we should break off the FWB thing because it wasn't working out.

I had gone 2.5 years without sex so 2 weeks felt like chump change, and we had even talked about how busy I was (minus the getting high part). 

I thought that was that and there would be no more talk of it. But, fast forward to this Wednesday, my birthday, she had gotten drunk again.

She snapchatted me asking why I *ghosted* her. I didn't, I was still involved in her life and we would talk often. I told her this and she laughed at me, passive-aggressively saying that because we didn't have sex in that span of two weeks I ghosted her.

My birthday had already been kinda shitty before this happened. I even vented to her about it before the night happened. But this cut me deeper than it probably should have. I tried to tell her how anything might have appeared as ghosting.

I told her that my schedule started getting more hectic with finals approaching and that work was stressful and any free time I had went to decompressing to relieve stress. She seemed to understand but then again she was also still shit faced.

Today I texted her asking her if she still thinks I ghosted her. She was sober. She laughed at me the same way and said yes, to which I politfully said that I don't think it qualifies as ghosting considering we talked every night before the situation ended. She laughed once more and said ""I'm gonna have to respectfully disagree.""

I even looked up what ghosting is. I found it its when a partner leaves or disappears for no reason without a trace. But I didn't. 

Am I the asshole?"
879,cvoyg8,"WIBTA for not letting my terminally ill grandfather meet my child? I had a pretty decent relationship with my grandparents for most of my life. My relationship with my grandfather has become strained in recent years because of his racism, homophobia and political beliefs. I mostly maintained our relationship to spare my relationship with my grandmother.

This has been status quo until just under a year ago when there was a family blow up. It started with my grandfather asking my mother if she would go to Italy for a weekend to be there when my grandparents renew their vows. My mom didn't think she could afford to take time off of work nor would it be worth it to fly all the way there from NY for an hour ceremony. She asked if he would be open to doing something locally instead before their trip and he threw a huge temper tantrum.

This included having his lawyer remove my mother from their will, screaming at her on several times and calling her selfish for being willing to drop everything to be there for my great grandmother and not him. For context, my mother took a year long leave from school when my great grandmother was diagnosed with terminal breast cancer so she could take care of her instead of putting her in hospice. It was an incredibly selfless thing for her to do, and the fact that he thought his vow renewal was anything close to deserving of the sacrifice she made for my great grandmother was the final straw for me and my siblings.

None of us have spoken to him since.

Recently, my family got together and a previous conflict with my grandparents came up. My parents told me that when I was younger they had a court order for my grandfather to not be around me. I don't have the full details, but they said his behavior made them uncomfortable. He was very obsessive. Demanded my mom tell him where I was at all times, demanded he see me a certain number of hours a week, etc. My mom said when she was younger he was the same way with her, and worse would demand he kiss her on the lips. So, overall, he's creepy with female children.


We found out from a family friend recently that he was recently diagnosed with cancer and is dying. My grandmother doesn't know we know and I'm not sure why she didn't tell us (except that maybe she knew we would be less sympathetic).

I'm due in 6 weeks. The idea of this man meeting my daughter freaks me out. But, he's dying. And I feel like I'm an asshole if I tell my grandmother ""Sorry, I don't want your husband coming to meet our child"". I don't want to hurt my relationship with her, and I know refusing to see a dying man will make me seem like a total dick. But I just don't love him after everything he's said and done, and I don't want to give him the opportunity to start the same obsessive behavior with my daughter that he did with me and my mom should he live longer.

If I tell my grandmother I don't want him visiting us with her... Am I the asshole? If she asks why, am I the asshole for speaking ill of a dying man?"

882,dyyo0r,"WIBTA if I cut off my college friends? Please bear with me as this is my first time posting here and I have been carrying this burden for years.

Me and my friends were very close back in our college days. Close to being best of friends. We were on the same classes all throughout, we hangout to play DotA 2, drink together and overall were compatible companions ever since.

After graduation, we went on our separate ways. They got their jobs and I was the only one that went to pursue further studies ( i went to Law School )

One time, we decided to to have a beach outing. I broughy my girlfriend. All was going well. We all got drunk but one of my friends (let's call him Mark) was insinuating that he likes my girlfriend. I avoided it because i might be interpreting it in the wrong way. We all decided to sleep after sometime 

However, in the middle of the night. My gf woked me up silently and told me that Mark is at the bottom part of our bed. I was also confused on why our bed was rocking and that was when I found out that he was masturbating in front of my gf. I was so furious but he pretended to sleep as i was rising up. i was able to contain it as i didnt want to get involved in any crime because i was readying for the bar. We left immidiately in the early morning.

My other friends comforted me and my gf after the incident.. 

However, as we went on with our lives, my friends kept being with Mark and even going out on beach outings. I often see them on facebook getting together for small drinks and other activities( i am not invited ). I confronted them once as to why they are doing it and said that they ""forgive him and they dont want Mark to get depressed"". I only went to them on special events ( some had kids and some married )

Things went on like this even after I passed the bar.

The last straw was when my gf and I was hospitalized for Dengue virus, my college friends messaged me and basically told me they will come visit me. 4 days went by and no one visited me. My gf had a lot of visitors. 

On my last day on the hospital, i went online and checked some stories/myday. It was then that i saw that they were with Mark at a restaurant celebrating our friend's birthday while I was at the Hospital hoping for them to come.

I felt so down that day. I don't want to be friends with them anymore.

883,e44dai,"AITA for not wanting to draw stuff for relatives? This is a throwaway obviously.

I draw stuff. I'm not great, i'm learning. I mainly draw cartoony Disney-like style stuff. I mostly draw fanart because it's what motivates me the most. I'm a neet, i live off of my parents. My anxiety prevents me from earning money with what i do, but i'm taking meds for it - they've been helping. I've received messages asking about comissions, i ignore them frequently because i get scared about ""stepping into the next level"", i dunno. Felt like i had to give a little background about what my life is like and how my craft weights into it.

One thing i've started doing this year is cartoony portraits of real pet photos. I did it first for an aunt i really love since her dog had passed away - and i've also done it with random pictures i find on Instagram, those pet accounts, you know? I just draw the pet and post it tagging the person, their reaction makes me happy and that's all.

My mom started doing something that makes me quite upset around that time. She went around promising art for relatives. I told her it didn't work like that, but she was adamant about it and i did started a few portraits, but there's just no motivation, you know? Anyways, i know she's my mom and is probably excited about what i do, so whatever.

Today an aunt i particularly don't like asked my mom (not me) if i could draw her pet. My mom came to me, and i flat out said no. What ensued was a big fight in my family. My dad started throwing at me words like ""you did it for your aunt once, you gotta do it for your other relatives or else they'll think ill of you"", ""i'm a practical person, it'd be easy for me if i were in your shoes"", ""if you really wanted you'd do it""... Yeah, no shit - i DON'T want to do it.

My mom does oil paintings and had to deal with such requests herself - i could not believe she was siding with my dad and flat out sabotaging me like that. She probably thinks my art is inferior to hers because it's not realistic or something. Anyways, i feel awful. I've blocked both my parents from looking at my Instagram. I guess i just wanted to write this somewhere. Can anyone help me see their side? AITA here? I don't think my art'd be worth much, for the record. I just... I dunno, feel like this whole situation is wrong."
884,e592uc,"AITA for not having a relationship with sister after trauma/drama? My (33 F) sister (44 F) and I used to be close.  I was really sheltered due to strict parents. I wasn't allowed to get a job, go outside, or go to friend's homes. There were parts of my sister's life that seemed strange but I accepted it at the time since I didn't know better. Now that I'm older I can see she made poor decisions and I don't want to be a part of her mess.

My sister had social issues. I loved her nerdy side but she had no boyfriends or teenage social experiences. Her friends were much younger than her etc.

When she was 22, our parents sponsored my Aunt's family to live with us. My sister fell in love with a cousin (16) and had an intimate relationship. I was aware of it but I didn't speak up because I was raised to not speak up against elders. (And yeah, I often walked in on them and they brainwashed me to defend them.) Everyone had fights that resulted in broken property and she threatened to kill our Mom and sibling over the years.

Fast forward to college.  I graduated during the recession so I focused on my life. At the same time, my sister (30's) struggled. Met a guy, had a kid, got married, and later while going through divorce, she met a NEW partner and became pregnant again. Then while knocked up with this second baby, invited us all to a ""wedding reception."" She asked me to do photos for free. I did, paid for prints and she hated it. She later tried to blame our family for ""allowing"" her to marry her first husband.

She treated me like a therapist. ""Our parents were terrible because... I wouldn't be in this position if someone else had..."" (Frankly, I don't think ANYONE needs to be told NEVER sleep with a first cousin, but I digress.) It was always the SAME 1-sided conversation. Finally, I told her to get a therapist because I can't offer professional advice. She unfriended me on FB & stopped calling. I blocked her number and email.

Now with her partner, they had 2 homes in Los Angeles. During the recession, my husband and I got a house and our parents helped with the DP. (They saved the money that I didn't spend on our wedding or on a car when I was a teen.) My sister heard and was LIVID. (BTW, our parents bought her a car, tuition free college, & helped live rent free through the recession.)

I've heard that my sister is mad at me because she made sacrifices to care for me as a kid, but as an adult, I've done nothing in return. I don't feel safe around her. 

THEN Mom died. With it, the flood gates of trauma came with it. Before she passed, Mom asked I try to make amends. I have no desire to ""fix things."" She didn't come to Mom's bedside. I contacted her  to say goodbye but she never showed up. Then when I told her Mom died, she said she'd be at the funeral. Her text ended with ""Have a nice life."" 

I feel like I abandoned my older sister but it was never my responsibility to ""teach"" her about life. I want to move on guilt free. I figure the last time I'll see her is when our Dad passes. Does this make me an AH?"
885,e1ztyq,"WIBTA for deliberately making my parents life hell? I come from a Malayali family(Indian for those who were wondering) however I was born and brought up in Mumbai . Recently my parents have been talking about shifting back to Kerala as they believe it will make us ""come together "" as a family. All of my siblings (20m,15f) and me (16f) think that this is utter bs and they just want to be closer to our extended family. However this shift will reduce all of our chances at a better future as we aren't going to get all the opportunities we do presently. Also , we don't want to be separated from all our friends. My brother will still remain in Mumbai as he has a job, but us girls will have to go. My family is full of misogynistic and homophobic people and my cousin (who is gay) has suffered enough shit from them. We tried to explain all this to our parents but they just won't listen. 

So me and sis decided on what we think is a good plan. The idea is this - we will start putting insane amounts of effort in our school and extracurricular activities so as to show our parents exactly what we will miss if we shift . Both of us are very talented at singing and painting respectively and know that we could win a lot of awards if we tried . If that doesn't work then we will start dropping hints to our family friends about how unhappy we are about this shift. Both my mom and dad are people pleasers and will bow too the pressure.

The reason we didn't perform to our full capacity earlier is that my brother(who is a genius in computer) started hating it because of my family's pressure to constantly overachieve. Neither of us wanted our respective talents to become something we hate so we decide to underplay them.

We know for a fact that this tactic might destroy or at the very least put a strain on our parents social life, but given that they would gladly do the same , neither of us feels really guilty .  However when my brother heard of this , he thought that was very cruel of us , so we wanted a 2nd opinion.Also fyi this has been an issue for 3 months and it has devolved to near daily fights  on this issue.

So, WIBTA for knowingly destroying our parents social life?

Edit: ok so a lot of people do not get what the issue is here. I *am* aware that me performing well doesn't make me ta. What I meant to ask is whether the both of lying to our parents by ommision and now making all their friends laugh at their idiocity makes me ta. I specified my culture as we don't believe in telling others about our family issues . 

Edit2: I have a feeling that most of the responders are American or something. Please understand that in my culture, log kya kahege( what will people say) is a common refrain. For those who don't believe me , please check out honour killings. While I am aware that my parents won't go that far, it is a thing.

Edit3: I would like to thank everyone who responded. I can see that the majority of people are saying that I shouldn't do something so drastic. Tbh I agree . Yesterday night was yet another fight on this topic and hence when we wrote this post , both of us were *very* angry. There was one thing I purposefully left out of the original post. While I am sure my parents miss Kerala , I have a feeling that their sudden insistence to shift is due to the fact that none of us children are particularly religious. Mom found out when brother stopped attending church almost immediately after moving out. Also I am bi, and I have a feeling that my mom is aware and wants to do damage control or something. They probably believe that shifting might ""put us back on the straight path"". So we discussed again and decided to play it like we are the ones at fault here and start behaving ""normally"" and like ""good girls"""
886,el460c,"AITA for giving my child a ""culturally inappropriate"" name? I am black, and my wife is also black. I spent my most of my childhood in the foster system, but for a good part of it I was taken care of by an elderly Russian gentleman (we'll call him Dimitri Petrovitch). While he never formally adopted me, he played a major role in my upbringing, and I am very grateful for all that he has done for me. Unfortunately, he passed away many years ago, and he never had any children. 

Fast forward to today, my wife and I recently had a son, and to honor the memory of my mentor, I decided (with my wife's approval) to name my kid Dimitri Petrovitch Williams. Williams being my last name, and Petrovitch being my son's middle name. However, it seems like it's only my wife and I who likes this name, as her extended family has been quite upset over it, saying things like ""What kinda name is Dimitri?"", or ""You ain't white, you ain't Russian, why did you give your son such as a white name."" 

It's true that there's no part of me that's Russian (I an barely speak Russian), but I feel like he's been such a big part of my upbringing that I had to honor him somehow. I confided in my friends too, and they said something along the lines of ""You a black man and you gotta be proud of your own culture. You gave your son an identity that he's not even a part of, he's gonna have a hard time in school with that name.""

So my wife's family aren't happy with our decision, and it seems like my friends don't really have my back either. I'm keeping the name that's for sure, but should I have reconsidered? Maybe I could've honored my mentor in another way?"

I will preface this by saying that I do not know all the context regarding some aspects of the situation with Mum and Dad's relationship, so, I am seeking opinions on my confronting Dad for a specific act of his, not the entirety of Mum and Dad's situation. I won't provide much context surrounding What Mum has done to Dad and vice-versa, the only information I believe to be of any relevance is that they have both made mistakes - I'm not looking for judgement on Mum and Dad in general, so please don't comment something along the lines of, e.g. - ESH - both your parents are assholes and please comment something relating to the specific situation, thankyou.

I got into an argument with Dad the other day about Mum which I now regret and have since apologised for; I don't regret the content of what I was saying, however, in hindsight, I can see I was never going to achieve anything by getting my point across in the form of a heated argument - I now recognise I should have approached the situation much more tenderly.

Dad compared Mum to her brother who will be referred to as 'Mike', Dad has called her the ""She-Mike"".

Mike is a vile human being and has done multiple unforgiveable things to Mum that I will not mention. Mike has been the cause of significant emotional trauma for Mum.

Dad compared Mum to Mike because of several outbursts that Mum’s had.  These outbursts include Mum yelling at him and come across as very illogical most of the time. Dad describes the way she acts as aggressive and I think this description is accurate to a certain extent; she will make aggressive movements such as stomping around and leaning inwards while waving her finger at him. Recently, these outbursts have become a lot less common and she has apologised for some of them. When defending himself to me Dad claims that he said that to Mum in order to help her to improve as a person. He thinks that comparing her to Mike is an effective way to get her to improve as Dad knows Mum doesn’t want to be anything like Mike.

After what Dad said, Mum came into my room in a mess, crying and had more sleepless nights because of this; it devastated her being compared to her brother.

I told Dad that I think the direct comparison Dad makes between Mum and Mike is extremely inaccurate and the more relevant aspect of what I expressed was that the way he approached improving or helping Mum to become a better person was cruel and extremely counterproductive; attempting to improve someone else by devastating and crushing them is an unacceptable thing to do to anyone, let alone your wife.

What I specifically want judgement on is am I right with my opinion on what Dad said? As aforementioned, I'm aware that I definitely should've approached the situation better, despite this, is what Dad said counterproductive, cruel and unacceptable?

888,daqawj,"AITA for asking guests at my apartment to disconnect from the WiFi so the livestream of the football game would start working again? A little background info: 
I am living with my girlfriend. I rent an apartment just the two of us share. I pay the entire rent myself.

So today my girlfriend and I are cooking dinner before my favorite college football team plays. She tells me some friends of ours want to come over and hangout. We didn’t have enough dinner for everyone so that was already awkward. I said I didn’t really want to have people over but then said whatever it was fine. 


The story:
They said only three friends were coming but 5 showed up and connected to the WiFi. My live stream of the football game began to glitch. I asked them to disconnect from the WiFi so the stream could continue. My girlfriend then calls me to the kitchen and said I was being so rude and they were our guests and I shouldn’t have asked them to do that. 

Really?? There are only maybe 10 or so games a year. I want to watch these games. I didn’t think it was rude. I pay for everything and felt I deserve to watch the game. It’s my house after all. 

The aftermath:

My girlfriend suddenly “lost her appetite” and I had to eat by myself and watch the game while they played cards. By the time I finished eating it was halftime and I went to play cards. Then suddenly my girlfriend was hungry again and left the game to go eat. 

Anyway we haven’t talked since this happened a few hours ago other than a few words. 

TLDR: asked guests to get off WiFi so I could watch a football game via livestream. My girlfriend said it was rude and has been ignoring me. 

AITA here?"
889,c6rkcd,"WIBTAH If I cut my brother and parent's off because of his drinking? TLDR; I feel my brother is a mean drunk & parents enable it.
I believe my brother has a drinking problem & I am honestly just tired of dealing with it.
My brother started drinking when he was 15 & while I tried to be the “bigger brother” & try to stop him, I mostly chalked it up to him being a kid. Then he went to college & joined a frat. He started drinking way more, but since I wasn’t around him much & it didn’t impact his grades (as far as I am aware) I again didn’t say much about it. But after he graduated he moved near me again & we started seeing more of each other. He has not gone to a family gathering without getting hammered since college. He gets into screaming fits with me every time & will follow me around unless I physically drive away, to the point that I could not even have a drink while I am there because I need to be able to leave when ever he got too drunk. I have tried to pull him aside & talk to him about it but he gets very defensive & calls me a pussy for being “so sensitive about drinking” & I have talked about it with my parents, but whenever I have, they point out how fat I am & how that is just as bad so, who am I to throw stones. (TBH I am very overweight, I was morbidly obese, but currently working on it & now just obese. Down 30lbs since Jan 20 & 70 more to go to be not overweight by BMI standards)



The final straw at my grandma’s funeral. I was in charge of putting together who was speaking. This is really the first funeral I have been to, so I asked everyone in the family if they wanted to speak & did not tell anyone they couldn’t. Everyone loved my grandma & she loved all them, so it wasn’t like there was bad blood. Her step grandson wanted to speak & I told him he could. That'll be important later. We have another cousin that is underage & has some pretty severe trauma & he developed some addictions really young. He was, at the time, 1 week sober. His moms asked that we not get too rowdy around him while we were stay at my other grandparents pole barn. My brother refused to not drink that night. He had his girlfriend stop & get liquor. 

He proceeded to get hammered (very frat boy stereotype shotgunning beers & taking pulls straight from the gin bottle & smoking weed.) I did not confront him that night because he was drunk by the time I got there. Once he was really drunk, he was having a conversation with other cousins about something & yelled to me to ask if I agree. I hadn’t heard what they were talking about so I told him so; he was already too drunk to string together a full sentence, to the point where I couldn’t figure out what he was talking about at all. He got angry & in my face because I would not back him up. I tried to explain that I had no idea what he was talking about. He finally got angry at me & said that I had ruined grandma’s funeral because I let “step-Grandson” speak & he talked too long. That hurt a lot. I just left. I didn’t want to leave because I don’t get to see my cousins that often, but I just needed to go to bed. 

In the morning I went over & cleaned up the pole barn while they slept. My mom came over later & I told her what happened she brought up my weight again & told me my health was going to be a burden some day. I told her that was not what we were talking about & mentioned he also smoked weed there too. She was mad that he was smoking weed in my grandparents house & said she would talk to him. When she did & he got mad at me for telling on him. I explained to him all the things he did last night (he didn’t remember) & that I was done being around him while he drinks. & I left. That was 8 months ago. We still see each other for holidays, but I keep an eye on his drink & start getting ready to go after his 3rd gin & tonic. I told my parents & him that I would not stay around until he can go one family gathering without drinking. (My mom tricked me into staying the night once since I drew this line in the sand, but this post is already too long)



But this week my brother skipped work (called off) to go to a bar crawl with friends. He had just started a new job & was really broke (called me and my parents for money) so him calling off extra bothered me. While out he ran into my best & oldest friend & he called me up concerned about my brother because he could barely walk. I told him all the above & more. My friend then called up my dad to tell him he was worried. My dad called me angry that I put our family stuff out there. I told my dad, in nicer words, fuck off, if he [brother] is not doing anything wrong why do you care if I tell people about it. He told me that he doesn’t tell all his friends he is worried about my weight. I said goodbye & hung up I want to just pack it all up & cut them off, but they are family. I am tired of being yelled at, & drunkenly abused, but now that I leave early it usually isn’t a problem."

But at some point I told her that if we weren't getting back together (she's against it), we should stop it, but she doesn't want either, so she keeps coming back. Honestly it hurts me a lot to keep talking to her. I don't want to remain friends with her, at all. And my new girlfriend wouldn't appreciate me casually texting my ex. I keep telling her that it hurts me and I have to move on and preserve myself and my happiness over being ""nice"" to her, but in her dream life we keep texting daily while being separated and living new lives. I think that's insane and she tells me that I'm ""always choosing for her"" and that ""social norms shouldn't dictate our behaviour"" (wtf). 

So, AITA for severing ties with her ?

I'm having trouble figuring this out, so bear with me. I need to provide some context; when I (F/21) was 18, I had a relationship with a guy we'll call John, who was about 30 at the time. Though it wasn't the worst, it was a very weird and uncomfortable two years of my life I'm trying to heal from. There were some traumatic things that happened and I just don't think I've recovered well yet.

My friend, we'll call her Jane, is having a baby. The baby shower is today, and unfortunately John is coming. I've known about this, but due to the wording of her invitation, it didn't seem that I could bring a plus one, which would have been my current boyfriend. 

I don't know anyone aside from Jane, and John being there is making it quite uncomfortable. Absolutely no one is talking to me, Jane has completely ignored me, and I was feeling very anxious, so I sent Jane a message and left.

His new wife has a niece (30 something) that she always invites to everything since she’s on the outs with her own mother and immediate fam. Her two sons are older kids, pretty out of control, and she never keeps an eye on them (there was a particular instance where I got at her 10 y/o who was throwing rocks at our cat, who was already hiding from him on our roof). INstead she takes ample time to make Bambi eyes at all the men, or I’ll be looking for my youngest son and several times, wouldn’t you know, she has him in a room alone, wherever we are. ‘Predatory’ would be a good term to use re: what vibe I feel when she is around.

I used to chalk it up to her being cougar-esque, but I’ve recently learned that she is close to my same age (35)—she’s been married a handful of times, each ending due to her infidelity. Whatever, not my issue to judge but...

What really sent me over the edge was a next door get together we attended where we arrived just in time to join in their hand-holdy prayer circle. My man went in first, I observe (niece) see him—she forcibly drops her little son’s hand and makes a bee-line around the kitchen island, so as to ‘conveniently’ wind up right next to my hubs. She missed the part where I came in, saw her bs and wound up meeting her on the other side of the island with my hand wide open, instead. Saw her face and Im 100% that she knew I knew what she was doing. 

Also, she is a caretaker for elderly people—currently she lives in a house that she gained from one of her (clients) passing. The lady’s family is trying to force (niece) out of the place, but she says the lady she was caring for ‘gave it to her’...somebody has to KNOW the type of person I’m talking about in this chick.........

I am one of the Assistant Mangers at a visitor attraction and our busiest time is the summer, so just before the summer this year we hired a new member of staff to cover weekends. Summer rota goes out (one of my jobs is to write it) and they announce they can not work the busiest weekend of the year as they have a thing that has been booked for ages. This really should have been mentioned at interview or at least before the rota was written, but the rest of the staff all rearrange their shifts so they can do the booked thing. This included us being slightly short staff yesterday and someone losing a day off.
Today I learnt the booked thing had been cancelled. How I learnt this was by the new staff member turning up at work with her family for a jolly (free as staff get free passes).

Am I The Aresehole for being really annoyed by this and thinking the correct response to the thing being cancelled would have been to offer to work?

898,bsv03c,"WIBTA if I sit in the bathroom for the whole day? The title is off but let me explain a crap ton of information to you.

My sister takes upwards of 3 hours in the bathroom when showering and just using it like a normal human being. I can hear her iPod through the door and laughing so I know she's not using it but just sitting there.

My parents have told her multiple times to stop taking so long because it's our aunt's bathroom, not ours. Even though it's our aunt's bathroom she has the audacity to yell at her saying ""IM GOING!"" like she's annoyed at her for wanting to use her own restroom.

I can't tell you how many times It's been 12 am and me having a full bladder going to my parent's bathroom inside their room and waking them up with the old ass door we have. I understand we got shitty bathroom locations but Jesus Christ my parents need sleep. Let's say it's 2 am she finally leaves the bathroom, I've been holding my piss in for 2 hours and I'm greeted to the smell of a fish market. I know exactly why and it's because she doesn't flush or wipe her waste till after she's decided she's had enough time in there or when my aunt wants to get in.

Today made me think of this horrible plan. I just got my braces done and it took me like maybe 10 minutes to clean my whole teeth, she kept coming back and forth trying to get me to come out but I just told her to use the other one since that's what she tells me. When I came out and told her she could have used the other one she gave me the dirtiest look I have ever seen, and to be honest it pissed me off way more than it should of.

I want to take as much time as possible in the bathroom to make sure that she learns a lesson. I know as a girl she has personal hygiene and stuff but whenever I ask nicely to get her to come out she yells at me, the same thing with my aunt.

&#x200B;

I wanted to be the bigger person but I can't anymore, I need something to be done. Does she have a bathroom problem that maybe I don't know about and I should respect that and let her take the time she needs? I know the format is shitty and my braces are killing me so I can't bother to remember my 6th-grade language arts class right now.

update - 6/2/2019 Not much to update on, she still takes long as hell but I've been able to use the other bathroom in my parent's room with no problem. I'm not sure what to do at this point, right now I just want answers as to why she decides to take so long in the bathroom."
899,ckfjvf,"WIBTA for spending vacation savings on myself? When my husband and I decided to have kids, it was agreed that I'd leave my job and be a stay-at-home mom, because it was essentially cheaper to do that than to pay for childcare. We also save some money because I'm able to homeschool, which cuts down on a lot of expenses associated with public/private schooling AND frees up our schedule to travel during off-peak times. I do however work part time with a couple of side jobs, and he does a little on the side. My husband's salary pays for bills and necessities. Our side jobs are more or less considered to be ""play"" money. 

I've been spending my money so far on things for the whole family, like vacations and throwing extra into retirement or our kids' college fund. My husband, on the other hand, has spent his money mostly on stuff for him. The most recent purchase was over a thousand dollars for a new gaming pc. 

That's fine and all, as it's his money to play with and enjoy, but I started thinking about my own purchases. I haven't really spent much of the money I've made on just me, and I'd kind of like to. So I'm considering cutting out one short beach trip to give myself back a little bit for things maybe a day at the spa or some shopping– things I normally wouldn't do and that likely won't add up to nearly as much as what the trip would cost. And if vacations are something that are valued more than stuff, my husband is completely capable of contributing to a vacation instead.

So... WIBTA for spending that money on something I want, instead?

Edit: We've talked it out. Since I am the one who handles all of the finances, he genuinely wasn't aware that I'd not been spending my money on myself. We've talked over some mutual discretionary fund goals/limits, and then anything above that can go into savings or vacation planning– which he is also going to contribute to."
900,bn6rwn,"AITA for taking my father's keys away and demanding more information My mom calls me at 7pm last night and says my 73 year old father went to a Drs appointment at 1pm and hasnt returned home or called. He was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis almost 20 years ago and it has slowly been breaking him down. He walks hunched over and uses a cane and also seems less lucid. 

I live 3 states away so I dont see him regularly but I have noticed the changes when I do visit. Hes mostly retired so he only leaves the house occasionally. Other than that he stays in his room. My parents have also been emotionally divorced for about 25 years, they are just roommates who share a last name now. They hate each other. Mom has no idea what his dr name is or where it is. Nothing.

Anyways so my sister and I start blowing up his phone. Goes straight to voicemail. She lives there so starts heading over to their house while I call the city hospitals. Hes not there. 

Finally at 745pm my dad calls my mother to say hes coming home and he'll explain when he gets there. An HOUR later he arrives and said he got lost going to the appointment. Apparently he drove around for 7 hours but during that time he did manage to call the dr to reschedule. He didn't think to call any of us for help or anything.

My sister and I feel like he shouldn't be driving by himself anymore and we need to get power of attorney while he is still competent to sign. Our mom said she will drive him but we have a feeling eventually she will get bored with being nice and send him off by himself just so she doesn't have to do it.

901,djr6ul,"AITA for feeling weird about my boyfriends friendship with his ex-fuck buddy? Me and my partner have been together for just under a year.

He has a friend who he was hooking up with before we met. They had feelings for each other and were FWB's for several months but decided not to make a go of it. We met a few months after they stopped seeing each other, fast forward to now and we are very much in love etc.

When I first started seeing him I brushed it off as not a big deal. But as we got more serious about each other it started to bother me that he would have phone calls with her etc. I have been cheated on before, but I have no reason to suspect my boyfriend of foul play. I can tell he is in love with me and I don't feel insecure. I have tried to rationalise this friendship as much as possible, and although I feel like I'm being unfair... I can't shake this uncomfortable feeling when I think about their relationship.

Whenever me and my partner have discussed her I've tried to be really measured about it. I've said things like 'I don't want to take anything positive out of your life', and I've really tried to get my head around it. I offered to meet her, if he wanted me to. But I've also admitted that it bothers me, when he asked me if it did. He has had some time to dwell on this and let me know that he would not be cool with it if I were still speaking to someone I slept with/had feelings for. As a result, in the interest of fairness, he decided to stop speaking to her.

So he tells her that he wants a break from their friendship, that he's getting serious about me and that he doesn't think its appropriate for him to be close to someone he has a history with while with me. She did not take this well, and basically accused me of being controlling/insecure/jealous. This obviously has put my back up further.

One thing that really got me, was that they had apparently had some agreement that she would be his best man if he ever got married. When they argued she brought it up and was like, well I can't do that if the bride hates me. This got me thinking, and I can literally not in a million years imagine being okay with my future husbands best man being someone he's fucked... even if they are totally over each other. Is it just me?

Am I the asshole for being uncomfortable about this relationship? Am I the asshole for telling my boyfriend I felt uncomfortable? Or is it reasonable to feel weird about your partner being friends with their ex's?"
902,bwwzyl,"AITA for ghosting a conversation once it turned to asking for money? TL;DR at end. Repost because I can’t spell AITA and character limit. 

My late husband had 4 kids with an ex wife, and the kids were alienated from him.

Once we married, his life was back on track, he got a job and paid child support, and a tentative rapport began between him and his kids. (They lived in a different state, so the rapport was mostly texting and phone calls.) Tragically, as this just started to bloom, my husband was diagnosed with kidney cancer and after a 3 year fight, died at the age of 44, leaving behind these 4 kids. They were all teenagers when he died.

I tried my best to be kind and supportive to them all, but we weren’t given a lot of time to become close. After my husband died, I did not maintain a deep contact with them, although I contacted them about the death, offered what pictures, clothes, belongings I could to them, as they had very little from their dad and obviously had a lot of emotions to process.

It’s been 8? Years since he passed, and his youngest daughter has reached out to be messenger friends, and we’ve exchanged friendly how-are-you type messages for about a year. She told me that she is on disability and doesn’t work, and has struggled with a drug addiction and did rehab. 

She lamented about 6 months ago that she didn’t have pictures of her dad and her from when she was a kid and I immediately dug through my husbands old picture albums and sent her all of the pictures I could find of him and the kids. She was very grateful. All was good.

Randomly a week ago I got a message from her (hadn’t heard from her in months) and she is asking for money, and the gist of the message sounds *very* “addict” to me (my dad was an alcoholic and I’ve been exposed to lots of addicts). She asked me to PayPal her some money “for groceries just to make it to the end of the month.” I immediately worried she was maybe needing money for drugs and I didn’t know what to do. She’s never asked me for money before.

So I replied hey, I’m traveling (which was true,) and said I’d get back to her, and then honestly forgot about the convo (I was traveling, applying for a new job, finishing a college class, and a ton of other things were going on.)

I got an angry message from her yesterday (it’s been about a week) that said something along the lines of “you could have just told me you weren’t going to give me any money instead of stringing me along”. 

I deleted the text and didn’t respond. Boundaries and confrontations are my weakness. My heart is heavy that she’s had a difficult life, but my “addict behavior radar” is also pinging loudly.

AITA for just ghosting the convo? Should I reply?

TL;DR- kid from my late husband messaged me asking for money, and she has a history of addiction. I said I’d get back to her and forgot, and she messaged me angrily saying I could have at least told her I wasn’t going  to send her money. I haven’t replied. AITA?"

Like the best possible roads for driving in our car. So we were listening to a history book together, chatting, having a great time on a nice Saturday.

And then we drive past my partners parents place and they text us and tell us to stop in. And then they tell us that we are now taking both their children and my partners aunty down with us. (My partners parents are coming down too they just didn't want to bring them all in their car, so they delegated to us). And since we can't fit five people in our little car, we have to take there spare car. Which is giant and horrible to drive and slow, and the power steering is broken so its a mission to drive.

- We had to drive across town to pick up the aunty (who also has her own car and could have driven herself) adding to our drive
- Everyone is fighting in the back cause cartrips with kids are horrible.
-Im sitting in the back too so the aunty will fit
-We can't listen to our book cause the kids don't want to.
-Gonna cost like $200 to gas up this car compared to fuck nothing it costs to run ours
-Gotta do it again on the way home.
- Instead of drifting around the coast road, we are crawling along in this horrible car.

On the plus side
- I do like my partners siblings so it's nice to see some more of them and nice for my oartner to see them as well, I'm just grumpy about the circumstances.



Edit2: Ok we are here now and if anyone's interested I'm actually having a great time. Ended up enjoying myself talking to everyone on the drive down and now that we are here I'm cooking and drinking and eating with our family, and it's great :). So still a little bit annoyed about my partners parents bossing us around but they always do that - time to learn to live with it! Thank you for everyone who replied enjoy your weekends."

And most of the people, it's fine because I actually talk to them. But one girl, she doesn't even extend the common courtesy of a hi. So I stopped giving her the answers on labs and stuff, because she never even acknowledges me unless she needs something.

So, Am I the asshole?"

906,ablttb,"WIBTA for calling the police and filing a report on some kids? So, for about the past week these two kids have been riding an ATV up and down my street, and assuming the rest of the neighborhood. This normally would be totally fine with me except in this circumstance these kids are riding im excess of the speed limit (20 mph), they appear to be young (im guessing 14 and 12 years old) or at least not old enough to have a license, the ATV isn't registered, they are riding around with headphones on, and they have absolutely no safety gear on (no helmet, no gloves, hell not even a reflective vest!).

This is extremely dangerous! And very neglectful of the parents to even let their children do something so reckless. ATVs, while they are fun, are not toys! They are motor vehicles capable of traveling in excess of 50 mph! I don't want to file a report to get them in trouble, I am just worried about their safety. All it takes is one spill to lose your life, I would hate to be in my garage working and hear the squeal of some tires or a loud crash and have to see someone poor child laid out on the road. 

Normally, I wouldn't get involved in other people's business, but this just feels so dangerous that I can't help but feel like I need to contact someone who could assert some authority and maybe prevent a terrible accident. 

Im actually going to call the police now because they are now driving by dangerously close to other children playing in the streets, taunting and showing their middle finger as they drive by. Am I the asshole? Or is my worry valid?

UPDATE:

The police were very receptive and quick to come drive through the neighborhood. I submitted an anonymous report and the officer was just as worried about their safety as I was. 

Im not sure if they ended up making contact with the kids but I did see the police cruiser drive past my house about 5-10 minutes later. About 30 seconds before the police went by the kids flew by on the ATV so they were a few seconds behind them. After I saw the police leave the neighborhood I noticed the kids pushing the ATV back to their house...so im assuming they spotted them and told them to push it home. Either way they haven't be on it since.

I honestly feel relieved. Every time they flew by I felt worried they were going to get into a wreck. A friend of mine flew off the back of an ATV a few years ago as the driver turned into a driveway. She unfortunately passed away as a result. I couldn't help but to think what if they clip a mailbox, or turn the handlebars a little too sharply, or a car backs out into the road in front of them. It would have been bad. I know they are just some kids having fun.. but an ATV is quite the upgrade for the same two kids who, just last month, were falling off their 2 wheeled hoverboards going down the road 5 mph. "
907,bth7l8,"AITA for freaking out at my MIL for screaming at my wife until she took our crying baby out of his car seat on the highway to calm him down? We were driving home and were about 15 mins away from our house but stuck in traffic. The baby was basically having a meltdown. My wife was in the backseat trying tic alm him down but it wasn't working. My mother in law basically started having a shit fit at my wife to calm him down b/c ""crying so much could give him a hernia"" and guilting her about being a bad mother. My wife took him out of the seat while I basically couldn't pull over anywhere (we were on a bridge). I got really upset and told her not to take him out of the seat. I was not really yelling but on the verge saying he's a baby, they cry, we can all be adults and stay calm for 10 more mins until we get home.

I finally was able to pull over and she tried to calm him down outside the car. When he's calm we get him back in the seat and start driving again. But of course he's upset (teething it turns out), and they force me to pull over again bc my MIL can't cope with him crying so loud and starts yelling at my wife again. At this point I blew up and told her she needs to act like an adult and just remain calm and stop stressing my wife out and forcing her to be unsafe with our child.

I feel like a shitbag for escalating this, but it's not the first time it's happened. I've talked to my wife about it, but she always says we just have to deal with it bc her mom has stress/anxiety issues. At this point I basically never want to have my MIL in my car, or alone with my wife and the kids b/c she can't remain calm and de-escalate the situation.

I definitely feel like an asshole for putting my wife in this position (although she admits she made a bad decision by taking him out of the seat in the first place), but I know my MIL pushes her buttons b/c they're so close.

909,evoaeu,"AITA for not paying my man's debt Im due to get a fairly large settlement here in the next year or so. Upwards in the possibly $500k-1 mil range. Would I be TA if I didn't pay off my fiancé's debt? We've been together for 2 1/2 years and in this time I've received SSI about year after we got together. And in that time they've pretty much guilted me into paying for stuff from his last marriage and fixing up the house his ex wife ruined. there was a car that was in his name that he bought for his ex but was in his name and instead of keeping it because he couldn't afford it him and his mom asked if I could lend him some of the money to pay of the remainder of it after it was returned to the dealership. He promised he would pay me back when he could. So I gave them $1600 out of my tax return for that year. later I asked him for it back because I wanted to get a car for myself. He got mad and told his mom and she screamed at me saying that for the first year I didn't do anything to contribute and he's paying extra bills because im there so that im not entitled to it back. And with one of my back pay checks from SSI (his mom is my payee) she took $1000 from it to pay for a floor repair in our bathroom which was ruined BEFORE I moved in. And she didn't even have a professional do it so it looks like shit. She didn't even ASK if it was okay. She just fucking took it. I would have been glad to give it if they had just ASKED me but they didn't. That's what pisses me off. Plus the fact that all these house repairs shouldn't be my responsibility. He pays the majority of the bills and I pay a portion of my check every month towards bills plus I use more towards groceries and other house hold necessities.

So with this settlement im getting WIBTA if I didn't tell my fiancé's family that im getting it because then they would guilt me into repairing the whole house.. I told my fiancé that I would repair some stuff like the living room floor because I've fallen through a few times but that im not gonna repair a whole freaking house that isn't even in my name. Like the fact that my fiancé's ex wife left him in a hard spot and they used his 8 YEAR OLD COUSIN'S inheritance ($10,000+) to pay off all the debt he had left over from his ex. And now he is trying to pay it all off before she turns 18. He said something about ME paying it back and I don't think its fair as im not the one who accrued the debt in the first place. I have some debt from before I met him and not once has him or his family ever helped me with it. Now don't get me wrong. His mom is usually really awesome and helps us a lot but whenever she spots me some money (never more than like $20) I ALWAYS pay her back. its just this whole paying off debt thing that we don't agree on. She thinks I SHOULD help because I love my fiancé and should want to help him. But I think they are trying to manipulate me or guilt me into paying for something I had no part in."
910,dtlfke,"AITA for not planning on buying a Christmas gift for my sister? So my older sister stopped by last Christmas. I didn't know she was coming until Christmas Eve and I'd already blown my budget of gifts for the rest of the family, so I didn't get her anything. My nanna did and got presents for her son. I didn't know her son was coming either. 

So my sister shows up Christmas morning, and opens her presents and her sons presents. And she acts like an entitled spoiled brat. I posted about her and what she did, so I'm not going to repeat it. 

She left to drop off her kid and came back for Christmas dinner and the rest of present opening. Well, she got $200 cash from my uncles as a Christmas present, but she also took my nannas Christmas present I gave her. 

My nanna opened it, my sister saw it and immediately asked if she could have it. My nanna didn't want a scene on Christmas so she said yes. 

I didn't know until after she left and when I confronted her about it, she still believes she's done nothing wrong. 

I don't think I'll buy her anything because I don't think she deserves it, but I do know it's the time for forgiveness but I can't get over how she doesn't even feel bad taking away someone's present.

911,cl89fm,"WIBTA for kicking a ~50 yr old man out of the home he's lived in for decades, out of spite on my part? I have an uncle (\~50yrs old) whom I ***hate***.  IMO he’s the most garbage human being I’ve ever met.  He’s *NEVER* been truly independent – he has always been supported in some way or another by someone else, usually my grandparents, and has lived with them all but \~6yrs of his entire life. He can’t manage to maintain a job for more than a year a most, and for the last 5-7yrs has made his spending money doing odd jobs or selling pot. He’s rude, greedy, and when he doesn’t get his way he bitches, yells, becomes verbally abusive, or straight up explodes in gibbering rage.  His abhorrent behavior is why my grandparents have enabled his mooching for decades; he goes nuclear over the pettiest of shit, so in the short term giving in is much easier for them, but they have suffered through decades of him living in their home.  They simply don’t have the will or emotional energy to kick him out.

Facing increasing medical expenses on a fixed income, they struggle to make ends meet on a regular basis. My brother and I came into a not-insignificant amount of money via inheritance and are discussing what we can do to help our grandparents out. We decided that if possible and with their blessing, we’d like to buy their house from them and not assume physical possession until they both pass (eliminating their mortgage/insurance/taxes, allowing them to live rent free, and paying to have things around the house fixed up that they can’t afford themselves). Once they do pass, we could rent the house out or sell it, and in this way make a sort of win-win situation (we get to help them out financially while also making an investment with our inheritance money).

The assholery comes in regarding our uncle.  If we own the house, **I want him gone**.  If my grandparents care more about keeping peace (and continuing to enable him) while they are still alive, we will respect their wishes.  But once it is solely ours, he has 30 days to find somewhere else to live. **I will not rent to him.  I will not support him financially in any way.** I don't know where he'll go and ***I don't care***.

I *know* that PoS is assuming he will inherit the house when they pass, but it’s based solely on a squatting mentality; he hasn’t contributed to the utilities, home maintenance, or mortgage in any substantial capacity, ***EVER***. He doesn’t even buy his own groceries. Legally I know we might have to fight him out, but I’m more than willing to do that. My aunts (his sisters) are telling us that if we force him out just because we can and we want to, we’re being assholes because he’s close to retirement age and “can’t” support himself, but we argue that the time is long, long, long past for someone to give him the boot and a serious reality check.  It's important to add that he's not disabled in any way. He's just a lazy asshole.

TL:DR Would we be the assholes if we kicked a dependent, but fully capable \~50yr old man out of the home he’s lived in expense-free for \~25-30yrs out of sheer spite?"
912,bm57rk,"WIBTA if I ever told my(serious) bf to not attend a strip club and then got annoyed with him if he did? My (serious)bf was talking about how he would go to a strip club if the event came up. I let him know that I would not be comfortable with it and he told me that if the opportunity came up that he would be going and that I would just have to get over it and that it is not ""cheating"". After doing some self reflecting I had realized that the real issue here was more that he was fine with doing something I am not okay with, without taking my feelings into consideration. The end result would probably me informing him of my feelings and likely avoiding talking to him for a period of time. I'd rather him learn his lesson about considering my feelings than anything. This is probably one of the less serious issues on here. Generally we end up resolving our conflict in the end so I think things would end on a good note either way.

My dad had told me that he was picking me up at a specific time, and it was about 10 minutes past that so I was anxious that he was trying to contact me and not getting through. So when my phone started ringing, I thought it was my dad and picked up immediately.

It was the guy I’m dating, who told me that someone told him that they had seen me being super close with a guy all night. I couldn’t hear well because the music was loud so I asked him to repeat it a few times and he asked me if it was true. I don’t remember exactly what I said but he says that I said “Yeah, sure” and he took this as confirmation that I had cheated.

Now he doesn’t believe me when I said that nothing happened because I didn’t just deny it, but in my mind, I thought it was obvious. He has also never accused me like this before so I didn’t think he really believed it was true.

915,eihp8i,"AITA? My [15M] mom is trying to drag me on a trip we agreed for a much later date to be tomorrow. I had already made plans with my gf for tomorrow and refused to go. In about a week's time my family planned on doing a road trip to some scenic place in the middle of nowhere 2.5 hours away from our home, I agreed for this date since I had nothing on and I'd be well-rested for it. Tonight, my mom told me that she mistakenly picked a date with shit weather and we'd be leaving TOMORROW instead. That hit me out of the blue.

I told her that I'd already made plans with my girlfriend for a relaxing day going around the parks in my neighbourhood, given we both had recently overcame some personal issues that threatened our relationship and so we needed time together doing something close to home and quiet. Being stuck in a car for 5 hours with my family is definitely not what I need right now.

My mom still told me it was ""unfair"" that I refused to go tomorrow, even though it's entirely her fault she didn't look up the weather the days she had to prepare, and that I needed to ""stop making things difficult for everyone else"", even though they can leave without me, and a long-ass car trip would probably turn tired me into a grumpy sack of shit, I've had enough of cramped car trips anyway. I told her that it was in no way my fault she failed to pick an appropriate date for the trip, and because of this she can't act like I'm obliged to agree to tomorrow. 

She then told me she couldn't leave me home alone since I might do sexual stuff with my gf given we have the house to ourselves, even though she knows for a fact I've lost my motivation to do any of that stuff, we both just want to sit down somewhere quiet and do nothing after the issues we went through. Still, I can understand why any mother wouldn't want her teenage son home alone with a girl. Honestly I'm too burnt out to care though. Sex in any way is pretty much the last thing on my mind right now. I just want to be with her and make sure she's feeling ok.

Is it fair for her to unexpectedly drag me with her? AITA?"
916,7v53r7,"AITA for not carrying about ranked video games? Usually when playing games with friends no matter they are I enjoy my time.

Whenever I tell them that I too am frustrated but they need to chill out as it’s still a game we get into a somewhat heated argument about what the balance is between wanting to win and just not caring about the outcome.

I’ll give you an example of one time when we were playing R6, one of my friends refused to play ranked because we hadn’t “practiced enough as a squad” and that we needed “5 people online in order to play (he didn’t trust the randoms coming online) I proceeded to explain to him that we should just play bc our rank is what we deserve and we will win if we have the skill for it.

917,9wt806,"AITA for threatening to sue former-friends to get back money they owed me? In the past, I've had to threaten former friends on two seperate occasions to get money that they owed me and I feel like an asshole.

The first time, I was living with a best friend in an apartment but he got unofficially fired (dropped his hours to 1/hr a week to avoid paying unemployment and expected him to quit). He refused to look for a job for months so I covered his half of the rent/utilities while his parents covered his cellphone and food with the understanding he would pay me back. I kept a whiteboard that listed everything in the main room. After five months, it drained my savings and I had to move out. We remained friends but in the following months, I saw him make posts on Facebook about going on vacations, ""winning it big"" at a casino, and buying new clothes. When I would ask for the money he owed me (which was around 3k), he'd say he'd pay using his tax returns but that never happened. A year later, he stops talking to me on Facebook and responding to texts so I text him that if he doesn't pay me the money he owes me in three months, that I'll take him to court. Sure enough, a few weeks later, he paid me.

The second time, I did some graphic design work for a friend for free since it was a simple thing but she wanted a lot more work done and I told her that since she wants so much done, I'd have to charge her and she agreed on a price per hour. I spend a month making the branding, website, and advertising for her home-based business. After the job was finished, I calculated everything and it was just shy of 5k but I dropped it down to around 4k since she was a friend. I give her the bill, she said she would have to wait a few weeks but she was happy with the results. Weeks go by and nothing, just kept telling me I would have to wait a bit longer. While all of this is going on, she's on Facebook talking about big trips her and her husband are going on, and showing pictures their new house being remodeled. A few months go by and she still wants me to do more work but I tell her that she needs to pay for what I've already done before I can do more. That's when she says that she decided that I would be a part owner of her business (she has no business experience or plan), and that I would get paid when the company makes money. I tell her that I would prefer the money since I was looking at returning to college and she flipped out, saying how I didn't believe in her and how I was a horrible friend; ending it by saying she was going to block me and that she would send me the money in a few weeks. I'm blocked, waiting for the money that never comes so I send a message to her company Facebook, her personal email, and a way to circumvent the text ban, all saying that if she doesn't pay me in two weeks, that I'd take her to court. Again, sure enough, I'm paid almost immediately. four years later, her company is still in the red.

TL;DR: Two former friends both owed me thousands of dollars and after waiting months, I had to threaten to sue them (even if I likely never would) to get it back, ending the friendship.

He took forever getting to us and taking our drink orders, then took even longer bringing them out. The drinks he brought out were wrong, so we had to wait again. Then we waited forever to place our entree orders. 

A waitress at the table next across from us noticed us sitting at a table without even water in front of us and stopped by and repeatedly to check on us and covered for our waiter - she was the one who eventually took our entree orders. She also brought out refills for my kids twice while our server was playing on his phone next to the bar. 

The food was fine - but our server never checked in on us after bringing it out. I had to request help from passing busboys and other waiters.

The restaurant was NOT busy that night - it was only half full, and there was plenty of waitstaff - our server was not overworked, and the bar was not backed up. I know this because I repeatedly saw him sitting casually at the empty bar talking with the bartender for several minutes. 

After waiting over 10 minutes for the check, I went up to the hostess to request it again. Our waiter, who had been chatting with someone in front of the kitchen saw me and finally seemed to remember that I had asked him for the check and came over to print it out. 

I left him a $0.01 tip. 

Then I went to the table with the helpful waitress, and said “Our service was terrible, but your waitress helped us out a lot. Could you give this to her?”, they happily agreed, and I left cash for a 40% tip for her. 

My wife was horrified that I did that - she just wanted me to stiff the lazy waiter. 

So... AITA?

So firstly, I'm a bit of a casual gamer. I normally just play Minecraft alone or with my boyfriend. So, when a couple of my friends invited me to play, I prewarned them that I wouldn't be very much help, but came on with them anyway.

Straight off the bat, they were way further along on this server than me (no surprise, since I was new and they had been playing for a while) so I left to a nearby small island that had a few farm animals on it. I had found a couple white sheep and a lot of flowers, which I turned into dye and I coloured my sheep.

I was about to grow some wheat to breed my sheep and make an orange sheep, when one of my friends attacked my sheep in order to get them into a pen. I was quite upset about this and asked him to please not hurt my sheep again. He proceeded to knock me into said pen, which I am aware was just a playful thing.

Here's the thing with the rabbit situation. I moved in and they said they had a rabbit and two tiny dogs. No problem with the dogs. I despise rabbits with every part of my being now and I wish I could punt them into oblivion. They don't control this rabbit, the apartment is covered in litter boxes that the rabbits either don't use or they fling poop all over the floor, even in the kitchen. They pee on the couches, especially in the beginning and the whole apartment smells like a mixture of weed and rabbit feces. Then, this December, they came home with ANOTHER rabbit. My agreement was only one rabbit, and I assumed they would keep it in their rooms most of the time as well as clean.

So today,  they asked me to pay 30$ for one of those super cheap wire fence things you can put together with those circular plastic pieces.  I HATE this thing. I've almost broken my foot on it and I already have to climb over a 5 foot fence (I'm 5'1"") just to access the washer and dryer yet for some reason they think they have unlimited access to my room. This fence that I tripped over twice is in our kitchen (they didn't even ask me) right in front of the fridge. This thing is only 4-5 pieces of super thin black wire that comes halfway up my shin if that.. No way that thing is 30$. 

&#x200B;

Would I be the asshole if I told them to pay for it themselves?



Thanks everyone who responded, they said they will be moving me to a new apartment,"
924,bf2gmu,"AITA for refusing to answer questions about Game of Thrones? Last Sunday my girlfriend was at work so I was going to watch Game of Thrones by myself, but she asked me to wait and watch it with her (even though she hasn't seen a single episode before) because she wanted to spend time together. I said ok and waited until she had the day off. 

So, we're watching it and maybe about halfway into it she asked a question and I answered her, but then told her that I don't want to answer anymore questions because I'm just trying to watch it and there's too much for me to catch her up on. She kind of agrees, but then a little bit later she wanted to ask me another question and instead of answering I straight up just told her that I'm not going to answer any of her questions. 

My tone might have been a bit abrupt so she got a peeved and said something along the lines of *""well, maybe I should get a boyfriend who would answer my questions""*, and then something like *""you know, if you had a question about something I would answer it""*... to which I responded *""if I didn't watch 7 previous seasons of a TV show and just started watching during the very last season I wouldn't even have the nerve to ask questions about the show in the first place""* and told her that I'm just not going to watch the rest of the episodes with her cause there's too much to catch up on and I don't want to spend the time answering her questions while I'm trying to watch the show.

After the episode was over we're kind of at an impasse and snark each other a bit and then she says something like *""well, it was only two questions it's not a big deal""*... to which I said something like, *""well, it's not just two questions because you probably would have asked even more if I didn't say I wasn't going to answer them... are you going to ask questions if we watch the next episode together?""* and she said *""yeah probably""* so I straight up said I'm not watching it with her anymore.

926,d4cxol,"AITA for being annoyed at my (18F) boyfriend (18M) for being too busy to spend time with me? My boyfriend and I have been together for 8 months. I’m leaving for Marine Corps boot camp in 9 days, and we will have no contact except for an occasional letter for the next 3 months after I leave. 

For extra context, we live together in his mom’s house due to my home circumstances. We have been living together for almost 4 months. I’m pretty close with his mom and I love them both so at first it was a great set up and of course I was incredibly thankful for the hospitality that was shown to me. But on to the actual issue. 

He’s expressed that he’s really sad about me leaving and wants to spend time together. Yet, he’s gone almost all day every day, even on weekends. 

He goes to school and work, which I understand is necessary, but tells me he’ll arrive home at x time and then doesn’t actually show up until 3 or 4 hours later. With no warning, text, or call to let me know that he won’t be home at the time he said. He usually doesn’t even respond to my texts or calls when I check in with him to make sure he’s ok and there’s not a bad reason for him being late (problem at work, car trouble, etc. I worry a lot, lol.) 

Then, when he does get home, he basically just lies in bed and sleeps or plays video games until he’s ready to pass out. Meanwhile, I’m home all day (I quit my job already in anticipation of leaving for boot camp) bored out of my mind with nothing to do. 

Today I got really pissed off because it’s a Saturday and we spend Saturday’s together. He had to work from 5am to 11am and told me he would be home at 11:30. Well, 12 pm rolls around. Then 1 pm. Then 2 pm. Finally at 2:30 he gets home, and I try to be happy and suggest something for us to do. He said he was tired so I suggested going out to a movie, because he could relax. 

But no, he just lied down in bed and went to sleep. I woke him up at around 4:30, upset, and we got into an argument. Basically he said that it’s not his fault he has a busy schedule and I’m being selfish and dramatic. I said I agree that it’s not his fault but why does he tell me he’ll be home at a certain time and then show up hours later? He said it’s because he gets caught up with other stuff, goes to get food, drops friends off after class, etc. then went back to sleep. 

He didn’t get up until 7pm and is now on the couch watching a movie. I’m just really annoyed. 

So, am I being selfish by wanting more of his time to go to me? I’m leaving soon and I just want us to have quality time and memories together. Am I the asshole here?"
927,e81055,"AITA if I call the police on my older brother to get possession of my car back? I financed a car back in 2014 when I had a steady income. Absolute beauty of a car, 2014 Chevrolet Impala, silver, looks brand new. However, I had to drop out of college for severe mental issues. In turn I lost the $1800 stipend I used to get from my scholarship. As a result, I could no longer afford to pay the monthly car payment. It's been another ~2 years and I'm trying to get my scholarship back and go back to school because my mental issues have gotten better and I would also like to pay for my car.

About 4 months ago my brother got a job. He doesn't have a car so I let him use mine in the meanwhile. He's been using it for a while but when I ask him for it on the days I have appointments, he makes up excuses as to why he needs it more than I do, like for example how my grandma's van wastes more gas (which it doesn't, I've checked). We got into multiple fights and during one of those fights he claimed that since my ""bum ass"" can't pay for the car anymore, it's no longer my car but the ""family car"" instead. I thought that was complete and utter bullshit because at first he said it was ""mom's car"" because she was paying for it. Then my mom took my side and he switched excuses. He refuses to give it back to me and always fights with me and my mom over it. I've gotten advice from my therapist and cousins to just call the police since the car is my name and they'll return the keys to me. 

I've tried my hardest to rationalize and be civil with this guy but he doesn't want to admit that he just wants my car because he loves it and would rather be driving it than his girlfriends compact or my grandmas van. I also pay around 100 bucks every month towards the car from the scraps I make. I honestly don't know what to do at this point."

Last week, my bf (20), me(22) and a friend of mine (f – 21) went to the South of France (near the frontier, Le Perthus) for holidays. We stayed at my abuelo’s house for 6 days/5 nights. We ate there, we were allowed to use everything (TV, bathroom, washing machine etc..) in the house, eat whenever we wanted whatever we wanted : that is how it is at my abuelo’s house, they are the best. 

My friend insisted in bringing us there and assured us she would bring us back home with her car, we could have used ours but thought with 1 car, it’s less expensive. She refused to fill up her tank in Spain while we were there (Spain is at 10 min of my abuelo’s house), while everybody go to Spain for that, it’s so much less expensive than in France !! 

My abuelo cooked for us, good food, veggies from the garden and all. She hates everything. She only wanted to eat salchichon or burgers from fast foods. No veggies for her, no fruits, no good meat, no delicious cheese : she even said she could eat only what a 4 year old could eat ! (they don’t eat burgers everyday but ok..)

I showed her the region, brought her to the beach.. she is white as a sheet because she prefers to stay home to play videogames. I don’t judge her for that, but she used my sunscreen that was new because she didn’t want to buy one and emptied it because mine was for tanning, not protection ! She wanted FULL protection so she put the whole thing on her, I had to buy another one. I told her it wouldn’t protect her skin, she refused to listen. So afterwards, she was burnt, she asked for my hydrating cream of course, because madame didn’t want to buy one and emptied it too. 

Then the last day, she out of the blue left me and my bf on the beach, saying she had to absolutely go home early (because Overwatch had an upgrade and she couldn’t wait anymore to upgrade her game). She left us there, without car. We had to go back to our abuelo’s by bus, all the afternoon lost on the road. Then, the day after we were on the road too, because we came back home by bus too. We payed the price for the bus. We couldn’t do otherwise. 
When me and my bf were in the bus back home, she sent a text demanding us to pay for her gas  expenses.

929,ebzfgm,"WIBTA If I Locked My Roommate Out On Purpose? I am on mobile so sorry for the formatting. 

Some backstory: I live in a two bedroom apartment where there are two girls per room. 

My direct roommate, in the span of one month has already lost her keys twice. The first time this happened, she was locked out of the apartment and rang the doorbell consecutively until I (out of the three girls) opened it at 4 AM. A couple days ago, she lost her keys a second time and rang the doorbell over and over again until I opened the door for her again. 

The first time it happened, I talked to her about it as I had work and classes in the morning. Our leasing company also has a quiet hours policy from 12 to 8. The second time, me and another roommate formally lodged a complaint as its currently finals week for us. 

Several days after the report, she wanted to talk to me alone. She started yelling and cussing at me about how it is my fault if she gets kicked out onto the streets and how as a 20 year old, if she was 18 (I am 18) she would not have been so immature and selfish. 

None of this really gets to me, and I say that I understand why she is upset and asked what she would want out of this talk. That’s when she said: “You’re probably not in your right mind because of all the pills you have” 

Note: I am diagnosed with three mental health conditions and I take medication along with seeking therapy for it. 

I instantly burst into tears and told her that I needed to leave. As I left to go to class, I called my other roommate who is out of the state visiting family if I could stay in her spot in the other room. I then proceeded to take everything that was mine, the Brita water filter, pans, plates, paper towels, and toilet paper and put them in the other room.

She has still not replaced her keys (it’s been around 10 days) and goes out late at night. The leasing contract also stipulates that any resident can also pay a $100 lock out fee to get their door reopened. AITA to take away my supplies and not open the door for her anymore?"
930,bwxzar,"AITA For not going to my GF's planned kayak trip for a BJJ tournamwnt? Background for context: 

My GF (23F) and I (26M) have been dating for around 7 years. A little over a year and a half ago she took a job 3 hours away and we have been dating long distance since. The distance has been stressful but recently I have been picking up hours at work and have not been able to see her as much. This has put even more stress on us. 

She really dislikes the city I live in and has been trying to get me to move up to where she lives. I said I would come up May but have now pushed it back. I am serious about moving up in July. She is now saying she is done coming out to see me due to how ""shitty of a town and house I live in"" (the house and city aren't the best). Due to her refusal to come see me I told her I won't come out to see her until she visits me. This is all very recent and I don't truly know if she is refusing to see me but she did have an opportunity to come over about 2 and a half weeks ago and she made plans with her brother instead.

As a side note I have been training jui jitsu for around 7 months, I really enjoy it and have been wanting to compete.

Conflict:
Around the time she went out with her brother she made plans for this weekend, for me to come out and go kayaking on Saturday at her place. We usually take turns going to each other's house and it's her turn to come to mine but I said whatever and planned to come out. 

Fast forward to after a jui jitsu practice the coach announced that there was a tournament coming up this weekend nearby. There is another tournament in August but by then I'd be up living at her place and in a different gym presumably.  In general I really wanted to compete and didn't want to wait when I had an opportunity in front of me. So I booked the tournament and still planned to see my GF thur-sun but would have to leave Saturday morning and be back to her house on Saturday night. 

My GF, to say the least, was extremely pissed off about this. Told me how disrespectful i am and how embarrassing it will be to tell her friends that I picked this over kayaking. She told me I can either cancel the tournament or break up. I told her I wasn't going to cancel the tournament, that I know I'm being rude but this means a lot to me and I'm going. So she said we're broken up and hung up on me . 

Am I the asshole?"
931,bnylkt,"AITA for not wanting to be my brother's caregiver? Throwaway account and altered background since my main account has identifying information.

I am a mid 20sF. My brother is in his early 30s. He was diagnosed a paranoid schizophrenic when he was 16 years old. I am his younger sister by seven years.

When I was growing up, I took the brunt of the consequences of his illness. We never went out for my birthday since my brother refused to leave the house. By default, my brother became the GC and I the SC. If I ever complained, I would get told by my parents ""Your brother is mentally ill - you need to understand."" 

I just finished getting my Master's degree and have a part time job. I am in a serious relationship with a great guy -- we're coming upon four years and have spoken about marriage.

My parents have always expected me to be my brother's guardian when they pass. I would be OK with this except that my parents have enabled my brother to be 1000% reliant on them. My mum cooks for him and waits on him hand and foot, and my dad is pretty much his chauffeur, driving him to wherever he needs. My brother is a smart man (builds computers) but my parents' infantilization of him have made him dependant on 24/7 care. I cannot be his nonstop carer (I work) and although my BF feels bad, he also works and doesn't have the time to be a full time aide. I blame my parents for making him essentially useless due to their enabling and even though I feel awful, I do not have the financial, emotional, or time capacity to be a full time aide like my parents are to him (they're elderly and retired). 

AITA if I send my brother to a facility where he can be taken care of, rather than living with me and BF? I would make sure he gets the best care I can afford, but I cannot be an on call carer like my parents currently are."
932,e3jxrf,"AITA for thinking my girlfriend's wealthy parents should help her with her medical bills? So 2 years ago my girlfriend had surgery for an ovarian cyst and at that time she was diagnosed with endometriosis. Since then, she's had 4 ovarian cysts bursting this year alone with 2 of them resulting in ER visits and 1 resulting in an urgent care visit. She's been on birth control for more than a year and it's caused other issues (depression).

She is still on her parent's health insurance and the first ER visit was a hefty bill and she managed to set up a payment plan with the hospital that she is just about to finish paying off now. She is also currently on a payment plan for the urgent care visit.

Both of these bills along with other bills eat up her entire paycheck. All of these financial issues have had a major impact on her mental state and worsened her depression. It seems like most days if she's not dealing with chronic pain from her endo she's dealing with financial troubles and it's an endless cycle.

The second ER visit just happened a week ago and was a reluctant visit since she really could not afford to go. We ended up having no choice when she developed some more alarming symptoms. Before going, I suggested since she was so bogged down with medical bills already to call her mom and see if she could help her with this bill. In the past, I have offered several times to cover her medical bills because of the stress but my girlfriend is adamant that I do not help her since we aren't married. There is also tension with her mother and I because her mother does not want me to think that they cannot/will not take care of their daughter with medical bills.

So we went however her mom gave her a long speech about how this was irresponsible and that the only reason my girlfriend had these medical bills was because she needed to learn a lesson about not leaving medical issues to the last second. Flash forward to yesterday, there is a huge argument and her stepdad essentially states that my girlfriend is entitled for thinking they should help her with her medical bills. My girlfriend's argument is that she has never asked for their help before and has been paying for her own phone, car, insurance, etc. since she was 16. His argument is that the parent does not have a responsibility to help their adult child with medical bills regardless of the situation or the context.

Her parents make well over 6 figures, both have new cars, a half a million dollar home, and just came back from a very expensive Europe trip. My own parents have always taught me that family helps family and even though my parents aren't wealthy in the slightest, I knew that in my early 20s if I was struggling I could always rely on their help. I just can't wrap my mind around how her parents can flaunt their wealth so openly and yet stand by while their own daughter suffers from an unpreventable chronic illness/chronic pain while also juggling depression and financial woes that they could easily take away without putting them into any financial trouble whatsoever."

Whenever this occurs, she gets very upset and we get into a fight.

She says that since we rarely see each other it’s not fair that I don’t want to kiss her when we have the chance.

I know that the majority of the world has the virus, but I have never had cold sores, so maybe I don’t have the virus. Maybe I have the virus and just never get cold sores, but I’d rather not be sure to get the virus by kissing her and come to find out that I didn’t before, but now I do and I get cold sores because of it.

A few months ago my friend’s girlfriend was grabbed by the butt by a guy in the hallway. He is a freshman, and in the middle school has touched nearly a dozen other girl’s butts and they went to the middle school principal and nothing was done about it. 

Then a couple weeks into his freshman year he grabbed a friend of my girlfriend’s butt in the hallway on the way to lunch. Our school got refitted with cameras this year. Every classroom has a camera and every part of nearly every hallway is on camera too. He tried to play it off and kept walking. I was told about this. The girl who was groped was upset over it but didn’t want to report it for various reasons. I asked my girlfriend when and where it happened so that i could report it to the school. And so i went to one of the few administrators i trust in the school (i’m not a freshman so i’m familiar with the administration, most people are new). And i told her when where and what the kid’s name was. She went onto the cameras and got the evidence. The kid was called up to the office during a class with the girl who was groped and my girlfriend. So the girl who was groped found out and got upset. And my girlfriend sides with her friend on this. 

I debated reporting it before i did. My reasoning was not me trying to be a savior. I knew the girl probably wouldn’t like it if i reported it. The reason i did was because my girlfriend also has 2 classes with this kid. And should it happen to her and i didn’t report it, especially if it happened on camera then she likely wouldn’t be believed or not much would happen. I don’t know what kind of punishment (if any) the kid received but i don’t doubt that if he gets caught again he will get in a lot. Also, this kid has done it to other girls at the middle school and got away with it. I thought if he got caught the first time he did it in the high school with all the cameras it would act as a deterrent and he at least wouldn’t try it again during school. Finally, i also thought if he got away with it he would surely do it again to someone else. Even if it was not my girlfriend. And that any future victims would appreciate the evidence from the previous time because it was 100% proven on camera. Thus the next victim might not need video evidence. "

939,cn8pf2,"WIBTA if I didn't tell my Dad that I'm moving out? All right, a little bit of a backstory here.

I'm a 24-year-old (f) college student and I'm planning on moving in with good friends of mine in about 3 weeks.

My parents separated when I was about 6 and My mother, my brother and I have lived in the house ever since. My dad moved into an apartment. The house we live in is my dad's as he inherited it from his dad. However, my mom pays the mortgage since my dad is very bad with money.

My Dad an I don't really have a deep relationship since he is an alcoholic, called me and my brother ""just another bill to pay"" and has some untreated mental health problems. The agreement with my mother all those years ago was that he wouldn't have to pay child support and in return, we'd get to live in the house rent-free (we do however pay taxes for living rent-free.. it's a strange thing from my country). This was fine and everything for years. My dad never so much as paid a doctors bill, school bill, activities. He has absolutely no idea of the hidden costs and how much my mother supports me and my brother, from the occasional grocery money, doctors bill or funding my public transportation tickets.  He thinks my mom is being an asshole and is cruising by in life because she doesn't have to pay rent.

Also, my mom is considered ""working poor"". She barely makes enough to scrape by even without having to pay rent and he makes more than twice as here. Of course, he spends all his money on booze and his model trains and then whines about not being able to spend more money because we don't pay rent.

He has stated many times that he wants to sell the house. I hate that idea because it's the house both my Dad and I grew up in (I guess he has no emotional connection to the house since his family was... disturbed, to say the least) and I would really like for either my brother or I to be able to live there with our potential future families.

Now I'm moving out and I'm really scared because I don't want him to kick my mom out. My reasons for that are a) she is really attached to the house, it's been her home for 25 years b) she can't afford an apartment and c) (selfish reason) she couldn't support me going forward.

Now, I'm in the last year of my master degree, I work at my college to earn some money and I receive a scholarship which is aimed at financially struggling students.

So moving day is in almost 3 weeks and I still haven't told him. My mom thinks I shouldn't tell him and to be honest he wouldn't notice since he's almost never at the house anyway. But somehow this isn't sitting well with me.

I'm scared to tell him because I fear he wants to sell the house immediately which would make life for me and my mom ultimately harder.

I want to ask him to postpone selling it until I have at least gotten my degree and don't have to rely on outside help anymore.

So, would I be the asshole if I moved out without telling my Dad?"
940,bg83w3,"AITA for accidentally misgendering my friend and them not speaking up to me about it? Yes, I know I’m dense. Obviously there were signs there but it wasn’t something I was actively thinking about. 

I had a friend in high school. Let’s call her Billie. In high school, Billie was Billy, a cis male. She’s now transitioning, but not on hormones yet. Billie isn’t her real name, but she did choose to keep her name old name but just use a different more feminine spelling. 

I didn’t keep in contact with Billie after high school. We were in the same friend group but didn’t hang out one on one ever. I kept up with maybe two people from high school during college, these weren’t even people from that friend group but just people whose parents my parents were friends with so I saw them during holidays, I’m closer with them now then I was the old friend group. I don’t have social media. Basically I had no clue Billy was Billie now, or I never would have misgendered her.

Sunday was my five year high school reunion. This wasn’t an official thing it was just some people from the graduating class organizing a catch up at an old restaurant. I got there and the first person I saw was Billie. She was dressed in a T-shirt and jeans, had longer hair but not below her shoulders. Basically, to my dumbass mind, she was dressed like a more fashion forward male who decided to grow out their hair. I walked up to Billie, shouted BILLLYYY and gave her a big hug. I asked how she was, definitely called her “man” at least twice (like, “I’m sorry we never caught up, man”), and brought up memories we had together from the past like when she did wrestling, had a mishap asking a girl out, etc... Then the real clutch was another old friend came up and I know in that conversation I definitely misgendered Billie quite a few times. 

Billie didn’t correct me. Maybe I’m thick but the moment she corrected me I would have immediately apologized (not made a big scene but just apologized and said I didn’t know and corrected myself). But the whole conversation she and the other person (who was probably mortified for me and her) let me keep going. 

I didn’t end up talking to her or the other person for the rest of the night. I talked to other people from the friend group and I now realized Billie was probably avoiding me, naturally. 

Anyway at the end of the reunion another person from the old friend group mentioned that that group was going out for drinks and I should come. We exchanged numbers and about an hour later I hadn’t heard anything so I texted that friend, who told me I’d made Billie very uncomfortable and anxious and that I was no longer invited. After a back and forth where I felt like an awful human being I agreed not to go.

But when I was talking to my boyfriend about it, he said it wasn’t my fault and that Billie should have corrected me. I hadn’t seen her in years, had heard no news of this, etc... I asked my non-binary cousin who basically said the same thing. 

So now I’m asking you guys, AITA?"
941,bmbd9s,"AITA for having an expensive(?) wedding?? I should start by saying I never ask my family for anything, never have and never will. I was a ward of the state (in Texas) under the care of my maternal grandparents and have virtually had to do everything on my own- and our wedding is no exception.

When we got engaged my grandma, mom and brother (the only three who I'm close to) were extremely excited. My grandmother's words were exactly like this ""if you need any help with anything at all just let me know"". And I did keep that in mind.

Fast forward to wedding dress shopping. I was fully prepared to buy my dress, at cost, by myself. However, my grandma wanted to help and was willing to put $500 towards it. So I said okay, and went on looking. I found my dress, it was a whopping $1,105. So I called her, full of excitement and having my full-on bridal moment, and she said ""you should be able to get a beautiful gown for less than $200. I'll have no part in helping you spend that much on a dress. Call me if you find something cheaper."" I was devastated. My MIL saw this and felt awful (she picked out the gown) and ended up buying it for me (making me feel both grateful and guilty in equal measure).

Anyway a month and a half goes by and my fiance and I have picked our venue- now they do absolutely EVERYTHING for us, we're talking  custom cakes, invitations, DJ, Photographer, catering the whole nine yards y'all. All we have to do is show up and pay for it! So our total cost for this is plus my dress/accessories comes out to ~$12,000. Again, we are paying for wedding. No one HAS to help us. So we tell our families, MIL is THRILLED and is excited for me to officially become her daughter- my family can't understand why we would spend so much and literally has made me feel like we're doing awful by spending ""so much"" on a wedding.

Anyway, are we asses for wanting to have a special day? I just feel kind of guilty now.

Update: Thanks y'all. I talked to my Fiance about all this too and we decided to leave them out of all future wedding planning. They're still invited, but they're not going to know anything about what's going on behind the scenes. I guess I'm still learning that I am my own person now lol"
942,cwgkfw,"AITA For not letting my younger step brother play on my pc? So I was on my pc playing some minecraft to pass the time and my little step brother walked in wanting to play, now a little backstory, my step brother had ADD, anger issues and was in therapy at the time so was quite irritable and got annoyed easily,

So I sat there playing and he asked if he could play, now I said yes at first and we started switching back and forth on minecraft for about 30 minutes until it was my turn to play, he passed it to me and about 5 minutes later he said this:

StepBro: I want to play now you’ve been playing forever! 

Me:It’s only been like 5 minutes you can play soon

StepBro: No I want to PLAY NOW 

And in a blink of an eye he tried to snatch the mouse from me, I moved the mouse out the way so he couldn’t grab it, he then went for the keyboard, grabbed it and slammed it on the floor, somehow luckily it didn’t break apart from a few keys coming off but I managed to put most of them back on.

After he had calmed down I decided to ban him from using my pc, mainly because I didn’t want my mouse, keyboard or pc to be damaged even more if he had another tantrum, but I feel bad because he has anger issues so it isn’t really his fault,

AITA?

EDIT: Just for the people asking, he was 12 at the time and I was 14 at the time.

EDIT 2 Electric Boogaloo: Thanks for the 100 upvotes guys! This is only my second post on reddit so 100 is really cool 😁"

944,b5dfcv,"AITA For Commenting on my Mother in Law's Post? So background: My MiL and I have always bad some issues. She's divorced, single, lives alone, and recently moved across the state to be closer to my husband and our 8 month old daughter. 

Now onto the story. Yesterday we went out to lunch with my mother in law, my husband, and my daughter. Lunch was fine, food was great, we talked and got along just fine. I even hugged her goodbye (I'm not a touchy person so hugging her is compromising and really affectionate for me) I thought all was well. Then I get home and see she posted on social media a picture of her, my husband, and my daughter, with a message about what a nice lunch she had with just the 2 of them. I went to the bathroom during lunch, where she quickly took the picture of the three of them. (I totally understand wanting some pictures without me and wouldve taken the picture had she asked) I didn't even know about the picture until I saw it on social media. And it honestly kind of upset me that she went out of her way to make it look like I wasn't there. I didnt mind the picture, just the sneakiness of taking it while I was in the bathroom and then not tagging me in the post about lunch like I wasnt there. (Yes I know its dumb that I'm upset about social media. It's just it seemed like our relationship was on the up and the post makes it seem like she still has beef with me) 

So when I saw the post I requested to tag myself in her ""check in"" to the restaurant we were at  and commented ""Lunch was great! I'm so glad the 4 of us could get together! :)"" admittedly it was pretty passive aggressively addressing that she intentionally excluded me, but I think to anyone else it just looks like I enjoyed lunch with my family. She got so upset that I ""attacked"" her on social media that she deleted her whole profile. 

So Reddit, AITA for commenting on her post? "
945,bnvv7m,"AITA for not calling my mom to tell her happy mother's day? TL;DR I have an estranged relationship with my parents, but our relationship is cordial. Recently got engaged and had a baby, not once have they called to congratulate us or ask about how their grand kid is doing. BUT they posts on social media on how much they love their grand daughter as if they have a relationship with her.

7 years ago I had a big blowout with my parents. They used to ask me for money every month and I would give them the money every month. It got to the point where it was expected from me, they live in another state so phone calls turned from “hey son how are you doing, how’s life?” to “hey son do you have money we can borrow?”.

When I started dating my girlfriend(now fiancé) my priorities changed. Every time they would call and ask for money I would tell them I didn’t have any to give that month. It went on for a couple of months, every denial I gave they turned a little more hostile. Then finally one month they called to ask for money and once again I told them I didn’t have any. The conversation quickly turned upside down to them calling my gf a “gold digger” and called her names. They’ve only met her once at this point so I was taken aback from all the insults. 

This argument went back and forth a couple of days to the point where I decided to send their calls to voicemail, after listening to one of the voicemails that my dad left and I still remember it word for word “I should’ve told your mother to abort you when she was pregnant” I called both of them said “fuck both of you”. I never contacted them again and blocked them from all social media.

Fast forward to two years later at a family gathering I decided to attend. My parents showed up and they apologized for whatever was said. I told them the only way our relationship would move on was if they never bring up money ever again. So for the past 3 years everything has been pretty cordial. But obviously the relationship isn’t the same, we have very surfaced conversations and I’m really just interested in keeping my relationships with my younger siblings.

This year has been a great year for me and my fiancé. We got engaged and we welcomed our daughter to the world. I post pictures of my daughter on IG and FB, my parents would take those pictures and repost it on their social media. They talk about how much they love her and how beautiful she is etc.

The thing is they don’t ever call or text and ask how she is or how my little family is doing. They didn’t even congratulate us when we got engaged. As a matter of fact I haven’t talked to them in like 3 months but yet they act as if they have this amazing relationship with my daughter.

So today I decided not to call my mother to tell her a happy Mother’s Day. I don’t think I’ll be doing that for my father either."
946,dohhny,"AITA for calling out someone cutting in line? I was at the pharmacy making a quick stop before work and it was very busy.

There were two registers like at the front of many Walgreens, bottlenecked so you have to form one line and alternate to whatever register is open.

About seven people were in line, single file, behind me and one at each register already.

Some lady with only a bunch of Halloween candy (Rx drugs are rung up in back by the pharm techs mind you) cut the entire line and walked right up to the spot behind the person checking out on the right.

I just looked her dead in the eye and said, ""excuse me you know what?  The line starts back there were all here waiting.""

She looked horrified and pissed off and said ""well isn't this register open too?""

I have a tendency to be very assertive.  So I said ""it is, and we're all waiting in one line, and I think we are going to just go to whichever opens up first.  The.  Line.

Is.

Back.

There.""

And she just stood there like an asshole while everyone else in line commented and one person said ""srsly all that just for some Haloween candy?""

I felt bad afterwards for being so abrasive but it really pisses me off when people act like they're more important than everyone else especially for stuff like that.

AITA?"
947,axgqjs,"AITA for hiding my transidentity to my parents ? I recently discovered that i'm trans. I told it to some friends, and always told them I won't tell my parents about it until it's done, because I seriously think they are transphobic. My dad said that he ""don't like trannies"", from his own words, and my mother struggled so much with admitting that my bisexuality is a thing that I can't imagine how she will react to her boy having to do irreversible actions on his body to become a girl. And they both mocked my FtM ex-girlfriend by misgendering her intentionnally, which is quite easy in french with accorded pronouns and stuff.

But some part of me tells me that I should tell them about it, because our family had hard time and the least I should do is to he honest with the people I live with and who still feed me and helps me to live. Plus, if they accept it I could seek for help a bit more easily.

But I don't want to face transphobia and (more) disappointment in me from their part. How egoist is it from me to care of myself more than them, to a point I'll hide them what I am ? Is it justified ? AITA ?"
948,eulpmr,"AITA for letting my daughter 'take over' my son's birthday present? My son Luca's 12th birthday was in August, and he asked for a drum kit. He's always loved drumming on things since he was a baby, and this was all he was asking for for a year, so we bought him a decent 5 piece beginner's kit for around $500 and told him we'd pay for drum lessons.

On his actual birthday and a couple of weeks after, he was always down in the basement messing with his drums. After about 2 weeks, he seemed to grow tired of them and went back to video games. By the time his lessons started 3 weeks later, he was dragging his feet about playing. In November, his drum teacher took us aside and said that Luca clearly wasn't practicing and didn't seem engaged, and he felt bad taking our money because Luca wasn't making progress. We asked Luca if he wanted to keep up drum lessons, and he said no.

In the interim, our 10 year old daughter Jessie would mess around with Luca's drums when he'd let her (she'd always ask), and it was clear that she not only seemed interested in learning, but she had a good amount of natural talent. When Luca said he wanted to stop drum lessons, we asked her if she wanted to start, and she was ecstatic. 

After her first few lessons and her clear excitement, Luca suddenly started to get possessive and say they were HIS drums and he didn't want her using them. If she'd ask to use them to practice he'd say no and she'd just practice on her practice pad. After I realized what was going on, we tried to talk to him about it to figure out what was wrong, but all he'd say was, 'They were MY birthday present, they're MINE.' My wife and I put our foot (feet?) down and told him that if he wasn't going to use his drums, he couldn't ban his sister from using them. If he wasn't going to use them and wasn't going to let anyone else use them, we'd just sell them and get his sister her own drum set.

Luca has been sulky and angry at us and his sister since then, and his sister is afraid to use his drums because she adores him and doesn't want to make him mad. I'm not sure where we go from here but my instinct is to sell his drums and buy Jessie her own. Josh thinks I should sell the drums and buy him something else, but this is a gift he BEGGED for for over a year! My wife thinks we should continue to beg him to let Jessie 'borrow' the drums he doesn't play.

AITA for how I'm going about this? I think if my son had asked if we could sell his drums before his sister wanted to use them I might have been amenable, but he seems to be doing this just to spite her.

EDIT: We don't have space (or money right now) for a second drum set. We are also just past Christmas where Luca got plenty of generous gifts, so paying him for the use of his drum set doesn't seem that appealing.

EDIT: There seems to be a misconception that we asked him to GIVE his sister his drums. We did not. We asked him to continue letting his sister use his drums, as he had been up to that point, to start drum lessons."
949,crl6xp,"WIBTA if I didn’t want to take my license/be my moms chauffeur So let’s start this off with I know a license could come in handy and is really important for some people, like if someone needs to go to the hospital. It could also be a really freeing feeling and all of that is great and I probably should just get it for the sake but I know I would never drive.

So reasons I don’t want to get my license.
1. I had terrible claustrophobia, if I sometimes was in a car when I was little I would just start screaming and crying until I got to feel the ground again. This ofc got better with age but I am still suffering because my parents thought I was just being dramatic and it went untreated. I now still get panic attacks if the subway stops or start crying if I cannot unlock the bathroom door. Cars are my biggest trigger and I just don’t enjoy it at all. I know if I got my license I would hate driving and never would want to.

2. I live right outside my countries biggest city, there is amazing public transport and it is so much cheaper having a month ticket than gas. I don’t mind public transport one bit. 

3. If I got my license my mom would use me as her private chauffeur. She has been talking about it for years how I will pick her up at 12 pm at the metro when she is out (she is usually out multiple times a week), or I can drive her home from anywhere and I can go to grocery store all the time. I just don’t want to do that, I really appreciate her driving me from place to place time to time. When I went to dance she would drive me once every 3 weeks and she picks me up sometimes at the metro but it is super rarely as I am completely fine with bus. I only ask if there has been accident or it would take me so much longer to take public transport and I have something I need to do. I am a full time high school student, my last year so I will have little free time to pick her up and I will work out 3-6 times a week. I really don’t want to be a personal chauffeur on my free time. 

I 99% will probably just get my license but I am really not looking forward to it. Would it be an asshole move to say I won’t get my license if I have to drive my mom around all the time? (ofc I will do it occasionally, but I don’t want to do it multiple times a week each week)"
950,d8840v,"AITA for complaining about my roommate's aunts? A little bit of context:

I share and apartment with 1 roommate, we're really close and get along pretty well. 3 weeks ago a cousin of hers had an accident an been in the hospital since, he's stable now and about to go home, her family is from another city, 1-2 hours from where we live. So the mother of the cousin asked to stay here while he's in the hospital, I totally agreed and support for everything they need, later other 2 aunts of her came to stay here too (ok... Im not so ok with it, but fine) . Three weeks forward they're still here, the apartment it's a little messy, but Im able to handle it (I like order). 
My roommate went to her parents for the weekend (in said city 1 hour from here) and leave the aunts here. Saturday night I came back from the movies and found two people who I didn't knew in the apartment, they just ""notified"" me then that they're staying here too. I text to my roommate asking about it and she didn't know about those people, I told her that I didn't like that I wasn't consulted about it and find like her aunts were taking advantage of the apartment.
Roommate agrees and apologizes, and said that they were leaving next day. Aunts didn't speak to me after that. 
I feel a little bad after since she mentioned that it occasioned confusion in her family, with her parents and aunts. She's been distant from me too. 
I know it's a hard situation and her family is really close, but they should have asked if they could bring more people since they were guests here. 

I can't help to wonder, was I the asshole?"
951,e7jnff,"WIBTA: If I called Social Services on my Great Grandma and her son? My Nana (66yr) has been taking care of her mom (90yr) for the last 20+yrs as a caregiver. Cooks, give her her medication, takes her to drs. appointments, bathes her, ect. She cleans the best she can for my great grandma I say the best she can because my great grandma is a hoarder. I'm talking about the type that keeps used toilet paper, rotten food, broken items, ect. My great grandma has 7 other kids besides my Nana, one of which that lives in the same house as my great grandma. My nana lives on the same property but in her own house, and my great grandma and her first born son live in the same home. Lets call him Jr. Jr feeds my GG's hording issue. My nana will throw away rotten or broken items and he will dig it out of the trash. Nana has even caught C going through her own trash for god knows what. Jr is critical of my nana, always yelling at her for cleaning or criticizing her for how she is ""not doing things correctly"" even though he does nothing for my GG besides take her to the store so she can buy him groceries. As a child I did not understand all of this but now that I am an adult I can see all the turmoil and craziness. It breaks my heart to think that my Nana is trying all that she can to take care of her mother but is basically getting emotionally abused by her own brother. The fact that Jr is pretty much causing elder abuse on my GG by the environment he causes makes me want to get social services involved. Because he will literally make it to where she cannot move through her own house safely without falling due to all the trash and he will not clean her or her clothes and leave her covered in feces till my nana gets there to clean her up. My nana checks on her 4 or more times a day. My nana tries hard, but bottom line my GG is basically suffering from elder abuse by Jr. 

Here is where I think I might be TA. If I called it would tear my family apart, I think my nana would resent me but I know she is tired of all these years of abuse. Her siblings and their children would hate me for doing this but I don't care about that, but I do care about them being mean to my nana over my own actions. Should I just talk to my nana and see what nana wants to do? I am scared she will say no to calling someone but I do not want to let the elder abuse keep on.

952,cnbjf9,"WIBTA if I told my parents how I really feel? I (29f) have one sister (30f), and one brother (41m). My brother currently lives with our mom and dad. He pays 400 dollars a month to live there and that covers everything. He does nothing to help my parents, and is a burden to them due to his immense amount of appointments So I used to have a really good relationship with my brother, but since finding out exactly how he behaves I cut him off completely. He has had 3 serious girlfriends. He beat all three of them, and is a violent alcoholic piece of shit. He hasn't paid a cent of child support for any of his 3 biological children, and claims he is mentally disabled to avoid having to work, and have his child support deducted from his pay. He has been in and out of jail for his whole life, and treats women like complete garbage.

Now my mom had 3 minor strokes and is disabled and my dad works 6 days a week. They allow my brother to live there and do fuck all, all because my mom is worried he is going to do something bad if she doesn't cater to his bullshit. Now to why I am angry about the situation:

- Their house is disgusting, like as if no one ever cleans it (which they dont). My mom physically can't, and my dad refuses to because he believes my brother should be doing it considering he gets to live there for pennies, and has everything handed to him. It's not only bad for their health, but I can't go over there with my baby because it's awful.
- everytime I see my mom she is so stressed out about my dad and brother not helping her. She is extremely agitated lately and I can tell its affecting her life, and her recovery. I have suggested to my mom to raise my brothers rent and use the extra money to get a maid to help with the cleaning, but she just ignores me, starts crying, and leaves. 
- my uncle passed away yesterday (my mom's brother) and my parents asked me to watch their dog so they could attend the funeral. Now first of all I would like to attend the funeral, but if my parents need my help I am going to help them, but i dont understand why my brother can't step up and watch the dog he lives with. Also my sister and I were closer with this uncle than my brother ever was, and most likely he is attending the funeral with my parents. 
- to add my brother is ALWAYS doing irresponsible and dangerous stuff when my sister, me, and all of our children are at my parents place. He has thrown burning wood out of the fire towards my daughter and my nephew. He has thrown chopped wood at my sister and I. I just dont feel comfortable around him. 

So WIBTA if I explained this to my parents at this time? I know that my mom and dad are extremely upset about my uncles passing, but I cannot keep watching them favour/enable my brother, and also be asking me to be in that house anymore."
953,bkovww,"AITA for not talking to the lawn guys Me and my ex moved into a tiny apartment that was owned by her grandmother. Her grandmother owns dozens of properties. She doesnt let anyone do yardwork because some people will do it and some wont. So she has some local guys that come around every week and do the yardwork. They mow, weedeat, rake, and get rid of all the limbs and leaves. This is what theyre paid to do by the landlord. At the time i was in between jobs and was there for most of the time. We didnt smoke in the house so we would go outside. Also we lived upstairs. But its not enclosed. The stairs and the landing at the top face towards the backyard.

954,b8mi4y,"AITA for not wanting to take in my sibling So. Throwaway acct. but here it goes.

My spouse and I currently live on our own in our house and we’re 26 years old and expecting our first child this week.

My sibling (16) is still living with our mutual parent. I have never gotten along with our mutual parent as I personally feel they’re a hypocritical pile of shit and a terrible excuse for a parent. Always on their phone, does what they want at all times with no real thought for the kid, and basically shows no attention to the kid regardless of what the kid wants. Nothing has changed since my sibling has been there

My sibling has some mental problems (bipolar disorder, depression, and a learning disability) that mean realistically sibling should have been given more attention than a normal kid, let alone, the attention they were given

So basically, sibling got caught liking a person of the same sex a state away and my parent freaked out. Calling sibling a demonic spirit and going extremely over the top with their conservative views under attack. Parent threatening to put sibling in a group home. And sibling therefore has spiraled into a bad spot.

Sibling wants to live with me and realistically I know it would be in their best interest because of the situation their in. But frankly, I hate the parent, and the sibling is frankly not very well equipped to handle a job or really any legitimate task due to being taken out of school. But I really don’t want that responsibility of taking care of a child that’s not mine and everything that comes with it, on top of having my own child otw. 

So I feel like garbage, because I’m sure I’m being selfish, but I also feel like it’s not my responsibility in the first place. I was hoping parent 2 would step up (parents are divorced) but I think they are in the same boat I am in (which I think is bullshit because it’s their kid).

So AITA for not wanting to put myself and my wife through taking care of my sibling on top of my own child despite the fact that my siblings mental well being would be in a much better place if I did.

Also this is my first post here so I’m sure I’m missing things that would make judgement easier, just let me know."
955,bbarz0,"AITA for not engaging with my neighbors annoying grandkids My neighbor has three grandkids who spend a great deal of time at her house. I find them really annoying. I find most kids annoying, but these are particularly grating to me. In the warmer months when they’re outside all day, my street rings with the sounds of them screaming at each other. One in particular is a bully, and she’s so mean to the others that it makes me want to give her a talking to. But, of course, it’s none of my business so I just keep to myself and hope that for her sake and the sake of other kids around her she grows out of it.

I know it’s not a crime to dislike kids, even though I feel a lot of guilt about disliking them so much. What I’m worried about is the fact that I won’t engage with them. When I first moved into this house they would say hi to me from across the street and I would say hi back, only to find the three of them suddenly sitting on my porch wanting to hang out with me. And there are no other adults around—they are basically free-range 6 year olds who come to my house and want me to play with them. Their grandma just lets them roam around. Which I already have a problem with, but that’s another issue.

So, I just stopped responding to them. I like to spend time outside on my porch, but for a long time felt trapped inside because these kids would see me and say hi and then come over to my house. It’s not just an inconvenience; I’m a writer, and I spend a lot of time sitting outside working. So if I have three young children asking me if I like dogs and cartoons and french fries I can’t get any work done.

I’ve since started ignoring them, and it works really well. They shout at me from across the street and I pretend not to hear them. They don’t come over, and I get to enjoy my porch and work in relative peace. I say relative because I still hear them screaming, but at least I don’t have them directly talking to me. But I feel like a mean person for ignoring them. They’re not stupid. I’m sure they understand that I used to be nice to them and now I’m not. I’m also not on good terms with their grandma for other reasons, mostly related to her very aggressive dog that she lets roam the street unsupervised. So I haven’t addressed the topic with her since we’re already not friendly.

I may not like kids, but I don’t want to be mean to them. I also want to enjoy my porch. Telling them that I’m busy and can’t hang out with them has not worked, as it results in a new barrage of questions about what I’m doing. They still say hi to me every time I see them, and I ignore them. I feel like a real asshole!"
956,ajwzy1,"AITA for not taking homecoming pictures off my instagram of my sister and her ex per her new boyfriend's request? First I'm gonna provide some context. About two years ago I met this guy named Sean, and after about 6 months of knowing each other we became very good friends. So much so that when homecoming rolled around during our sophomore year we decided to go together (I was still identifying as female) as friends. We went in a group with my sister and her date, my friend Robby. Everything was pretty fun as we took some bomb pictures.

After this, my sister broke up with Robby and started dating Sean. He started to hang out with me less, which I understand because he was dating someone and stuff, but still I feel like he just pushed me to the side. He didn't say anything about the homecoming pictures and I liked them, so I left them up.

Fast forward and they've been dating for a year. I come out as transgender (ftm) and I get a text from Sean a week later with no hello, no how have you been, just one text asking me to delete the homecoming pictures a year and a half after I posted them and a year after Sean started dating my sister. I asked him why and he got really mad and told me to just forget it, but I told him I'd delete it when he told me why I'd delete it so I could avoid it in the future. 

He told me that it's not because I'm trans, which wasn't even a thought in my mind. Then he told me it was because Robby was in the picture with my sister and he didn't like seeing that, even though it was like the third thing I posted on Instagram so he'd have to go to my page and scroll all the way down. 

He then called me some names, called me my deadname, and told me I was just a girl confused about my gender. I told him that if he didn't want to see them, then don't look at them. Then he called me more names, so I blocked him. My sister and my mom were mad at me for not just deleting the pictures.

Just a little bit of petty high school drama. Am I the asshole for not just deleting the pictures?"
957,eob4xh,"AITA for leaving my parents' house after being yelled at? I came home from college to visit my family on my birthday, but within minutes of me being at home, I took out the mail and found out that I had a $200 bill from a doctor's visit. We have good health insurance, which was why I was confused why I was being charged and I told my dad, who exploded and started yelling at me, telling me it was my fault that I didn't show my health insurance card to the health practitioner and now I was wasting money. 

For the record, I have never had to show anyone my health insurance card and no one questioned it. Anyways, I was tired of my dad's short temper and decided that I wasn't going to be treated this way on my birthday, so I immediately left and drove back home. 

My dad called me several dozen times on the way back and left a few voicemails. I just got back to my apartment and opened one of them, and he was saying that he read the charge could be negated by updating my health insurance information online. I figured that that was probably an option when I read out the charge, but my dad didn't even give me a chance to explain myself as he was droning me out with his voice so I figured I wouldn't stay around.

I'm re-thinking the situation and remembered that he was going through chemo and perhaps was in a cranky mood, and I was already 30 minutes late to lunch and he was probably a bit hungry. We are financially stable and as mentioned before, we have very good insurance so we aren't worrying about the costs. AITA here? I feel like it's justified to not want to deal with being yelled at especially on my birthday.

On the other hand, he has a history of having a short-temper and has heavily yelled at us in the past. This time I figured since I had a car and was living away from home, I didn't have to hang around. I did promise to spend that day with them though and my mom wasn't even a part of it. 

I'm a young adult and would much rather be spending my birthday partying with friends rather than having an obligatory birthday dinner with family. For the time being, I plan on staying at my apartment."
958,e4bf5a,"AITA for being upset that I wasn’t invited to brunch? My friends live far, we meet up only once/twice a year. I suggested we get together for Friendsgiving. We agreed to meet in Chicago; factoring the cost of gas and food/drinks for the weekend, I knew I wouldn’t have enough money. I began scrounging, picking up extra hours at my min. wage job (including overnights and holidays), and sold some possessions. I coordinated contacting everyone, while my friend Alyssa\* booked an Airbnb for everyone.

The Friday of the trip I was short and had a breakdown. I’d been burning myself out at the job I hate and it still wasn’t enough. I had even arranged my own lodging with my sister since I couldn’t afford to be in the Airbnb. Luckily, my partner is sweet and paid for the gas bc he knew how important this trip was to me and he wanted to meet everyone.

We got in late Fri, so on Saturday we had brunch planned for 1pm. As our group of 4 staying separate from the Airbnb starts getting ready around 11/12, we get a text from the Airbnb group that says they are walking to brunch. We panic and ask where it is and why they don’t wait for us? Around 12:30pm they inform us that they’re seated. We again ask where they are so we can meet up but they tell us the reservation is only for 6 so they’ll meet up after. Disappointed, our group of 4 heads out to find our own food. I tell the brunch group we’re sad we weren’t included in the plans.

Hours pass, they’re enjoying mimosas, posting pics of them having a blast, etc. while our little group is still ostracized. Around 4pm they call brunch done and decide they wanna head to shops, then back to the Airbnb for more drinks. Still no invite for us to go join them. Requests that they meet up with us go unanswered.

As 6pm draws near and they’re still waffling on their way to meet up with us, I have a mini meltdown in the corner of Starbucks. Call it FOMO, sleep deprivation, being overly sensitive, or a mix of all 3, but being continuously out of the loop for the entire day (and night before) finally got to me and I decided that I didn’t want to see them at all anymore. My sis, BFF, and Alyssa all tried to get me to reconsider, since we had the evening to salvage, but I was too much of a wreck at that point. I felt unimportant, I had stretched myself thin working crazy hours, spent my last $80 (plus $120 from my partner), and driven 5 hours just to be excluded for the ONE day we were all in the same city– which had only happened because of me.

I explained my side when Alyssa asked, she claimed that they weren’t to blame for the “lack of communication.” I snapped. I didn’t care about blame and only wanted an apology, but she was more concerned about why everything wasn’t their fault rather than acknowledging my feelings/fixing the damage.

TL;DR: Worked myself to my breaking point to save up to hang with friends I don’t see often, they spent 6+ hours excluding me from plans. I freaked when they didn’t apologize, I was hurt and refused to see them at all after that. AITA?"
959,de0lfy,"WIBTA for telling my friend to cut ties with his best friend/ crush because she ghosted him on his birthday for someone else's? (all the names here are fake ofc but it's easier to follow instead of numbering them)

So my friend Cooper was supposed to have his surprise birthday party a few days ago. We invited about 9 people, 3 boys and 6 girls. 

None of the girls showed up including his best friend and crush. Her excuse was that she was saying goodbye to one of her friends who was leaving the country for good. I later found out that she lied and was actually attending someone else's birthday party.

Now the thing that baffles me the most is that Cooper is willing to forgive her immediately. In his eyes, she can do no wrong. I've tried to tell him that what he's doing isn't healthy but he just won't listen. I feel like she's going to take advantage of this in the future.

You should know that he went through hell and back to make hers perfect a few months ago.

So would I be the Asshole for telling him to cut ties with her?"
960,dnot8q,"AITA for not wanting to help my mom with the rent payment? So a little backstory to help understand where I’m coming from:

I’m a 23F living with my mom, and I just recently started working two jobs to get out of the debt I’m currently in. When I was around 19, i got my mom a new car under my name because her credit was crap. She agreed to make the payments, which amount to $480 a month. I also opened a JCPenney credit card, and shes used about $500+ of my credit. She also needed a phone so my gf at the time got her an iphone under her plan, which is about $130 a month (phone+data). Last year my mom had enough of her job so she quit and got a new job but a lower paying one. She stopped making the car payment, earlier this year and didn’t let me know. It was about to be three months behind. I found out and we agreed that I would keep the car and make the payments on it (there’s about $12000 left on the car loan). She also couldn’t afford the phone bill so I’ve been left paying it every month (it’s a contract with Verizon). So I’m paying about $710 a month for the car and phone bill and it’s been a lot for me to handle considering I have other bills to pay.

To me, it’s not fair that I have to pay an additional $200 for rent when im already helping my mom out by taking over the car payment and when she left me and my ex hanging on the phone bill.

AITA for not wanting to pay rent?"
961,cywbq2,"AITA for not wanting to photograph my SO brother'wedding? I started photography about 4 years ago, I haven't done many big projects, say like a wedding. I've done business headshots and graduations photos but nothing this big. So I was thrilled that my girlfriends brother asked me to do their wedding.

I started planning what I would charge them and I thought 1400 was a reasonable price. I told my girlfriends brother and his fiance the estimate and what I expect for down payment, when they would sign the contract. He messaged me back confused and expected me to shoot for free.

I asked him why he would think that considering we don't really talk at all and this is most we've ever talked in the 6 years that I've dated his sister and that I'm the only photographer at the wedding and editor so the payload is already a lot. I thought it was a kind gesture to low ball my services for 1400, let alone for free.

I told him no I would not do it for free so they decided to move to another local photographer.

So present day, their wedding is in less than a month, to which I'm still attending and my girlfriend's mom calls me and asks me to photograph the wedding again. I asked her brother why they need me and on short notice and he says that they can't afford the current photographer. I reluctantly tell them no because they already bailed on me from the beginning. His fiance is now trying to uninvite me to the wedding because I can't do this ""simple"" favor for them and that I'm not really family anymore. 

So AITA for not wanting to photograph their wedding?

Edit:
I forgot to mention, but they did offer to pay $700 the second time asking.

Edit 2:
My girlfriend and her dad are on my side of this, espcially since the brother has been living at the parents house rent free and jobless for the last year and has been taking advantage of them.
The mother and fiances parents however are furious/disappointed that I won't take the second offer. Even saying ""money is money"". The fiances parents even mentioned that the other half could be a gift for them."
962,cgotxc,"AITA for charging my family for a project I had previously given for free? I am learning crochet pretty much by self-teaching. I learn new stitches required for every pattern I do and often use tutorial videos. It's not my work or something I need to do, I just like the look of amigurumi and I find it calming to crochet pattern I know well and challenging to try something new. Last year I set myself the hardest project I had yet-complete one crochet project for every member of my family. I made some pokemon, some animals, and for one I tried a smaller and tighter pattern than I'd ever done before-Knight Solaire, who is a person and requires more detail.

I finished it all by Christmas and was pretty proud of myself, and since then I have sold dolls in town, to friends, and some online. I don't do it for work, but if people want me to go through that much work I'm not doing it for free. Especially for strangers. Recently my sister asked me to make her another octopus doll in blue for my baby nephew since I made a pink one for my older niece. I texted her the price for it, and the expected time frame when it would be done, and she was angry.

She said I already made it for her for free, so it's outrageous that I charge her for it now. She also argues that it isn't fair that my niece have one and my nephew doesn't and I should be fair to my family (he received a Mickey Mouse doll with a questionably made face, and she got an octopus-I thought that was fair?) and finally she said giving gifts isn't something that needs to be tracked and since she's family it should be free.

I feel like I may be guilty since I just sprung the prices on her, but this stuff takes time and money and effort. I enjoy doing it, but it's still taking my materials and my time.

AITA for charging family for something she expected to be free?"
963,dn58hy,"AITA for wanting a pet-free bedroom? My partner and I recently moved in together. He is in the veterinary field, he has always had cats. I love his cats, I have bonded with them, I never want to get rid of them.

Also, I am allergic to cats. And so is he. 
I take an allergy pill, but living surrounded by dander is quite different than visiting dander.

Before we moved in together, I mentioned that I would like the cats out of the bedroom to contain allergies. He didn't want that. So, my compromise was offering that the cats aren't allowed in the bedroom during the day, but can visit when we are home at night. He didn't agree to that either. 

It has been two months and my allergies have gotten worse. This week, I brought up the 2nd option again, he said no. I mentioned that I'm waking up gasping because my nose is completely shut and it's affecting my sleep. He replied that he  ""felt like I was looking for something to be wrong"". 

When my anxiety runs high, I do look for things to ""fix"" but this is not the case. I acknowledged his point but asserted that I was asking BECAUSE I CAN'T BREATHE. 

He went silent, which as good as killed the conversation.

Yesterday, one of his cats climbed onto my dresser and chewed up an item of mine with sentimental value. It's from Mexico and I'm in the US, so I can't exactly go to the store and buy another. 

I started crying and my boyfriend's solution was that I should ""just put my stuff on a shelf so the cats can't get it"". 

I don't think I should strip all of my furniture so the cats can continue climbing on it. I think someone who works in an animal Care field should probably spend a little more time training his cats not to walk on tables/dressers/etc. 

So, AITA for wanting a pet and allergy-free bedroom?"
964,a493wd,"AITA for asking a mother and her sick baby to leave? Sorry, English isn't my best language. 

Okay so here's the context: Every year around christmas, my family and I are going to see a ballet production. It's a tradition for us. At the production last night (nutcracker) there was a small family seated next to us. The hall in which the event took place wasn't very well heated and because of recent terrorist threats no coats or bags were allowed inside. 

So we all sit in the freezing hall and the family gets next to us. They consist of a mother, father, older kid daughter and a very, very sick baby. The baby was so young that it didn't even have its own seat, it was always handled from parent to parent during the play. 

Anyways: during the whole first act the child cried and cried and coughed without pause. Moreso: once the rat king in his terrifying costume showed up he got really upset and started screaming. The mother did not leave the hall with him but instead calmed him down (very loudly), earning a lot of annoyed looks from the other guests. The whole first act was ruined for us because the baby's cries prevented us from enjoying the production. Once the break between first and second act started and the lights came back on I could see that the child's face was red and glowing and the hair on his head was so sweaty, it got stuck on his forehead, meaning the child definitely had a fever as the hall was freezing as mentioned before. I got over to the mother and asked her to leave the production since her child was obviously sick and upset and did not enjoy the ballet, which caused half of the hall to not enjoy the ballet either.

She got very very angry with me, saying that I should not question her parenting if I wasn't a parent myself and that it was none of my business how she took care of her child. The father came over and scolded me as well, saying that I was rude for constantly giving them dirty looks during the production. A third, not related older woman also told me that I had no right to ask them to leave since they payed their tickets just like I did. 

I once again told them that a sweating, coughing baby does not belong into a freezing hall but should instead go lie down in a bed and that it was rude to the dancers to have the attention taken away from them because half the hall had to be annoyed by their crying coughing child.

The second act was just like the first with the exception that the child got very upset again and did not want to sit still anymore. The father then actually did decide to take him home. The mother touched my shoulder and very loudly and very rudely asked me if I was happy now and that I had ruined their first ballet production as a family.

AITA for wanting to enjoy a family tradition that we payed a lot of money for in peace?? I'm kind of expecting to show up as a Buzzfeed comment section ""mom-shamer"" soon

He also likes to tell me how to spend our money anyhow I am paying off his legal mistake he made before I even met him $400 a month. I finally told him that if you don’t work then you need that’s fine but you have to clean, cook and stop complaining so much. I make enough to support us both but if I want to get a new pair of shoes mind your own business I deserve to spoil myself. He says I’m being mean and asking a lot that we are a team am I really the asshole here?

To answer some of the questions, we have been married a little over 2 years. I have a major issue with confrontation so I didn’t straight up tell him that he needed to help more till about 4 months ago. Also I never spend money if it is going to put us in a bad situation, but I have put off stuff for me personally to make sure he has everything he wants and needs.

A little back story here is that when I met my boyfriend 5 years ago he would drink a lot when we hung out on the weekends but id drink also so no big deal. Didn't think anything of it. He would get up and go to work either way come morning. We moved in together after only 3 months (I was living with a friend and it was a bad situation) and everything was fine at first. He would work back then but as time went on he got hurt at work and was unemployed for years while I worked 60+ hours a week and he would spend all his time and our (mine but since we are together I'll say ours) money on beer. Not clean the house, not cook dinner not do anything besides drink or be hungover. This went on for a little over four and a half years, just 2 months ago he got a job but he drinks at the very LEAST a 24 pack 3 times a week then the next day he's to hungover to do anything. His argument is that I knew he was an alcoholic when we got together (I didn't) and that I stayed. I smoke but when we got together I was trying to stop. Haven't stopped yet. His argument is also that he will slow down on drinking if I stop smoking. Am I the ass for being mad that I have to give up something for him to make changes? Am I the ass for being mad he's an alcoholic? Am I just an ass? I have bpd so I can't drink it makes my mood swings crazy and it took me getting stupid one to many times to stop drinking, now that I'm sober I can't stand to be around him when he's drinking, his voice changes, he acts stupid and I just can't handle it!

970,bz8sti,"AITA for ghosting my family? So, I came out as gay at the age of 15. I got a lukewarm response from my parents, and a slightly disapproving one from my brother. My parents essentially said they will always love me, wanted me to downplay my sexuality so that it didn't become a big deal, and my brother was frustrated with me and didn't want to be around me after I first told him. In the following months after I came out to him he was distance and I felt like he felt I was embarrassing him. 

Fast forward now and I'm 22 and recently graduated college. Things with my family since then are mostly civil and normal, but we don't really talk about my sexuality or dating life, like its not acknowledged. Things between my brother are sort of awkward and tense, but we operate okayish. Until a few nights ago.

Basically, the conversation of pride came up where my parents and brother didn't understand what the point was, and I tried defending it. MY parents listened calmly, but my brother got flustered and left. Later, when I tried to talk to him, he accused me of attention seeking and saying that he doesn't understand why I shove my sexuality down his throat.

I didn't really have a response to that, but I was angry with him. So I left. My Parents asked what had happened and I told them. They said ""well you know how sensitive [brother, 19 M] is and maybe this just isn't something you should talk about when you spend time together"" but at that point I had enough and said that they were just excusing his behavior.

However, recently we had a small meeting discussing some students, and the principal mentioned a male student (13) in regards to his way of speaking. I didn't immediately understand what the problem was. I knew the student and I didn't notice anything wrong with him.

The school psychologist then said that he already talked to him (the student) about it and will keep track of further development of the situation. Since I still didn't know what the deal was, I asked. The principal then told me that his way of speaking was too ""feminine"".

I was shocked. The psychologist then said that he'll ""cure him before it gets out of hand"". I called him out in front of everyone and said that he is a disgrace to his profession if he really thinks that way. Everyone else looked at me creeped out for defending the students nature. They asked me if I really think gay people are normal. I just said that we shouldn't judge anyone. 

I am not liberal in the sense of protesting for LGBT rights in the streets or what not, but I think this goes too far. I am now the outcast in school. The principal even thinks I am perverted for ""defending gay rights"". They associate it with pedophilia and think of me in that sense now. I backed off and let them proceed as they saw fit. I didn't want to deal with that kind of accusations while working with kids.

UPDATE: The psychologist informed the parents about the counciling he suggested. The parents agree with him and the principal.

972,c5rb22,"AITA for leaving a package for my neighbor outdoors? Hey Reddit,

First time poster here... I live in Germany, but it's not really about the legal aspects, but maybe helps to place the mentality of people involved.

So I live in a big apartment complex with almost 90 flats and I was home when a delivery guy ringed and asked to accept 4 boxes for 4 different neighbors. This is the first time I did this, because usually I'm not at home during the day. I thought he has a hard job, so why not...
1 package was really big and heavy and I don't have the space in my flat. It's like an arcade in front of my flat door, 1 apartment behind mine, the house is  shaped like a U, so I'm almost at the end of the floor.
(sorry, english is only my second language, hope this is understandable as I describe it)
So 2 neighbors picked up their packages yesterday, today the one shows up that owns the huge package and asks me, why it is standing in front of my door. I told him, I'm sorry, it was heavy and I didn't have the space for it, so he goes on and and says it was my responsibility and if someone had stolen it, I would be liable. I'm insured for liability but I'm asking myself if I should have ringed on his door yesterday or something like that?
So, AITA for leaving it outside?

EDIT: Thanks everyone for your feedback! Now I don't feel as bad anymore about his attitude, because I can just put him in the category ""douche""
It's sad that my consequence will be to be more careful in the future about which packages I will accept"

At first he acted like a teen (both of us 26), not telling me whats wrong, only complaining, begging for pills. A few months ago when he was still begging for pills, i went a bit harsh and told him that his complaining is very annoying(he did not even tell me why he wanted them at this point) and im not giving him anything. He says he really wants a SO, he cant get over his exes from over 6 years ago, how bad is work, how stupid are his flatmates etc.

I understand the need of talking about our problems, i know it, im still a kinda closeted transgender. And when i try to share something with him, he is always super negative about it.

I love coming back home to my family and be able to sit in my own room in peace without being disturbed by 5 20-something year olds that want my attention. Uni is also a lot of work so i have to do a lot of it during the weekend, since i have no spare time to do it during the week. My parents are upset with me because i don't socialize a lot with them. Now i'm not the type of person who sits in her room all day and doesn't eat with her family or something, but i do want to be able to finish my uni work in time and not miss my deadlines. I feel like it's unfair that they are suddenly banishing me from my own home just because i have little to no spare time. Since my brother moved away they are really depended on socializing with me and i simply can't take it. I'm really exhausted and overwhelmed with all of this uni work since i just started my study. I want to be able to rest and have some peace during my weekends since my weekdays are so hectic. I'm sure some of you understand what it's like when you have a limited social battery. I'm not doing this on purpose to my parents but they act like i do. AITA?"
975,b116tz,"AITA for wanting my mom to delete an audio recording she took of me coming out? Long time lurker. First time posting. I'll try not to turn this into a wall of text.

I (F19) have been sort of going over in my head whether or not I should tell my mom about the fact that I like girls. She grew up in a very cult like setting where they were pretty much against anything and everything fun because someone did something in the Bible so don't do it or enjoy hell - they were not Christians, they were something way more fanatic so I'm not coming down on Christians. Anyway, she's said several times in the past that she would wonder where she went wrong or feel like a failure of a parent if I ""turned out gay."" But I knew this wasn't really her talking, but more of that cult talking so I never hated her for saying it.

Anyway, finally decided one afternoon to tell her that a recent outing with a ""friend"" off Bumble was more than that. I teared up, and became a lot more vulnerable than I usually am. I mean, it's a pretty scary situation. I thought she was going to look at me different. But she keeps texting on her phone and says, ""That's fine."" She was a bit more nonchalant about how upset I was than I cared for, but later she said she was trying not to make me nervous by looking at me the whole time so whatever. 

Anyway, something we like to do is go in each other's social media accounts and post something to throw off our friends. So while she was napping, I came up, unlocked her phone, and was about to go on her Facebook when I decided to check out audio recordings. Sometimes, she'll record us when we're reading a bad book or a bad movie to catch all the jokes we make and how much we laugh. So I click it thinking it's one of those until I skip ahead and hear myself crying and coming out to her not one week ago. I immediately wake her up and ask her why she did this. She says because it was, quote, ""a pivotal moment, or whatever."" 

I ask her to delete it. Telling her I was unusually vulnerable than I've ever been. She takes her phone, locks it with a new code, and refuses for no other reason beyond what was said above, saying I was being ridiculous. So now I don't know if I really am being. My friend says I have a right to be angry and that it's a violation of privacy. But I don't know.

976,ebkn49,"AITA For faking spending Christmas Eve away from family? So here’s the backstory; my cousin (my mother’s niece) & her boyfriend moved here from Portugal 1 year ago in May, and at the beginning things were rocky. I wanted to get along with her boyfriend, as we seemed to have similar interests, so I invited him to go to a giant tech store. When we got back his girlfriend was crying that I didn’t invite her to come along (This was their 2nd or 3rd day here). I didn’t even intervene because I felt like I had done something wrong. 

Regardless for the next couple of weeks & months she kept him on a short leash, and didn’t like to let him talk to me, and she wouldn’t talk to me either. During their 7 month stay at my house, they never paid for anything; no rent no gas for driving them wherever they wanted to go, nothing. It came to the point where when we had internet trouble because we had our line cut by accident due to construction, she didn’t talk to me to restore her internet, but instead sent her boyfriend. I didn’t restore her internet, and for 6 months she didn’t talk to me. They even offended our other cousin as she was passing away from cancer, saying “It’s so stupid to sit here and watch someone die, they should just pull the plug”.

 They found jobs and moved out, and my parents warn me when they’re coming to visit. So my mother hates the thought of them spending Christmas all on their own, with no family, and I despise them. They don’t talk to me, and rarely call my mother, only if they need anything. My mother didn’t invite them for Thanksgiving, but I know my mother would want to invite them to Christmas with them, so they aren’t all on their own.

I told my mother on Thanksgiving that I had plans for Christmas, me and my friends who don’t really celebrate Christmas are going to the city and gonna walk around and enjoy the day. This is a total lie, but this is so my mother feels comfortable inviting them over and she feels peace of mind knowing that I will have someone to spend Christmas Eve with. I intend to spend Christmas Eve alone in the city, but I just wanted to leave because they came into my house before, and acted like kings and spit in my face. My mom doubts I am actually spending Christmas with people, and she has a feeling that I’ll be spending it alone. Am I the asshole for leaving home on Christmas Eve and spending it alone while my mother thinks I’m alone and have her worry?"
977,ex2mlt,"AITA for crying about peanuts in Costco? My parents (45M) (50F) and I (15F) always had a somewhat ""lukewarm"" relationship. They have said very hurtful things in the past, and as have I, but I try not to let it affect our relationship too much as to not cause an argument. 

I hadn't gone out in a long time (homeschooled + Depression) and decided to go with them to Costco. My dad was already in a bad mood and pretty irritated. 

As we were going to check out, he turns around and asks me to grab something he forgot in the store. I didn't hear him at first (it was loud), and got closer to ask him to repeat it. He got increasingly irritated and asked me to get some peanuts, and I heard him this time. We weren't in line yet. I had no idea where peanuts were located, I'm allergic to them, so I honestly never had thought to know where they were. 

I asked him if he knew where the item was. He bent down and got into my face, then said in a loud voice,
 ""Just go, get out. Nobody wants you here."" 

I don't know why, but something just broke. I just burst into tears. I had been feeling extremely depressed for the past few days, so perhaps it made me more emotional and overly sensitive.
Maybe it shouldn't, but it just stung. It was so sudden and out of nowhere. I was not trying to make him feel bad. My mom told me to go to the public bathroom to go presumably cry. We rode home in silence. 


My family is now upset at me for irritating my dad, and saying I should have known what was coming. Perhaps they are right and I should have gone to find an employee, or even went to go look for them myself other than annoy him.

My mother later came into my bedroom and said, ""What you did was unacceptable and disrespectful. You better go apolgize. Now.""

My mind is honestly in a whirlwind. I feel bad for embarassing him of course, but I also feel like I've done nothing wrong. The store was packed, and I had no idea where to find the peanuts.

978,dhhohh,"AITA For telling my sister to just visit our grandmother? I am 27 my sister is 44.


Basically our grandmother had to be put into a home. Prior to that I was the one taking care of her everyday, but I’m just not capable of doing what she needs. I still feel guilty about it and like I failed her as a grandchild even though it’s been well over a year. The place we had it her is 45min - 1 hr (depending on traffic) from me and less than 15 minutes from my sister. 

I visit every Sunday and try to visit every tues/wed. My sister visits every other day (so she claims) unless I’ve visited that day. Instead of just asking me she flips through the sign in book to see if I visited. Sometimes there isn’t always a pen and honestly signing in doesn’t do anything, so it doesn’t bother me when I can’t actually do it. My sister on the other hand got a severe attitude with me. She said, and this is a literal quote, “you need to sign in so I know whether or not to feel guilty about not visiting.” I looked her dead in the face and said “OR you could just visit her anyway.” 

The other time we had this sort of disagreement was when my grandmother was receiving physical therapy. My sister said she couldn’t show up for it but offered me up instead. Therapy happens at 9 am. So basically she wanted me to get up at 7 something to be there by 8 something EVERY SINGLE DAY. I asked if she was gonna pay for my gas? Silence. Asked if she would pay for anything that might happen to my car since I’d be adding a bunch of extra miles? Silence. Asked why she couldn’t just do it? Silence. Told her I never acted this way when it was just me taking care of her for the last 3 yrs. Silence.

I know I’ve made her feel bad about it, but to me she’s just coming off as a total cunt lately. She doesn’t want to visit. She doesn’t want to help out. My dad won’t see it because he’s going purely on what she tells him she does. Also to top it all off she is so unbelievably mean to our grandmother. I will sit there and have the same conversation 8 times because she has dementia. My sister will get angry after the first time and coldly tell her “I’m not repeating this again.” She’s made our grandmother cry on several occasions and even caused her to fall. Honestly at this point I hate her. This woman raised both of us and I hate my sister for treating her that way. I understand it’s frustrating, but still. At this point grandma only really listens to me and it’s probably because I still treat her like an adult. 

Am I the asshole for getting this way with my sister and making her feel bad?"
979,crq3kh,"AITA for not being emotionally supportive of my ex who got an abortion without even telling me she was pregnant? So basically I was with this girl for 2 years. She ended up cheating on me so I broke up with her but she was very remorseful and practically begged me for a second chance. I felt bad so I did but it only lasted 2 more weeks because I realized I could never trust her again. Fast forward two months and I receive a text from her claiming that she found out she was pregnant shortly after we broke up but she had already got an abortion. IN THE SAME TEXT. She said that she was scared of being a single mom, since I didn't wanna be with her, and panicked. She apologized for not consulting with me first but she told me she needed my emotional support thru this time. Being livid that she didn't even ask me beforehand, I told her to fuck off. So she became spiteful and proceeded to tell all of my friends and family that not only did I know she was pregnant, but I also pressured her into the abortion. I know I don't deserve this but I can't help but think that if I  had just forgiven her right away for not consulting me and gave her emotional support, this wildfire would not have spread like this. Like I know she's still a POS for lying, but I feel like I could've prevented this by being the bigger person.

980,buno6c,"AITA for refusing to let my children be watched at a borderline hoarders cabin? I’ll try to keep this short as possible ...

My Mother retired recently and moved away from the city to be closer to me and the river.

This coincides with me needing childcare for the summer, so we struck what I thought was a mutually beneficial deal. She would watch the kids at my house and I would pay her.

Two weeks before the kids let out of school she casually mentioned they would be watched at her 400 square foot cabin. The issue is not only space but she is a smoker and a borderline hoarder. Currently her cabin is filled with moving boxes, no fridge, microwave, and dirty as hell.

She watched them there a few days last week and they spent 90% of the time on electronics. She didn’t send them outside to play hardly at all.

I have tried everything I can think of to convince her to make the short drive for the kids sake and let them stay home. We have ample space inside and out here, along with trampolines, playgrounds etc.

I know I’ve hurt her feelings at this point but I don’t want them over there. Even if she stops smoking inside the smell is already permeated her belongings and that’s not the summer I want them to have.

I love my Mom dearly and would hate to be nitpicking instead of relaxing and appreciate this great bonding experience they could have. I’m just not sure if I’m being unreasonable and a micromanager as she claims."
981,en8izq,"AITA for being more mad at my mom after my dad had an affair? Title might be a little misleading, but that is what it boils down to and I don’t know how to feel about this. 

My parents have a bad habit of screaming at each other and fighting in front of my brother and I, so I can confidently say they have been talking about divorcing since I was at least 8. I don’t remember a time my parents didn’t hate each other. 

After my brother graduated from high school (8 months ago), they began telling people they were getting a divorce. They’ve told each of us that they’re getting a divorce at least 3 times over my lifetime, but this is the first time they went public. My mom is still living in the house until this is finalized.

I don’t live at home, and I explicitly stated that I didn’t want either parent talking to me about the other and I didn’t want to know about their divorce. I am studying for the MCAT, still finishing my undergrad, and I have had significant mental health struggles over the past decade that have really hurt me both physically and academically. My mom knows this. I don’t have the time or energy to hear them shit talk each other or play telephone for them. 

Earlier this week, my mom called me and it went down like this:
Mom: your dad was having an affair, I confronted him yesterday, and I’m staying with my parents for a little while
Me: all right
Mom: you sound upset, do you want to talk about it?
Me: no, I do not want to talk about it.
Mom: well he’s the one that fucked up. I mean how do you feel about it, do you think it’s wrong? 
Me: I’m not picking sides, I’m not making a statement on it. I don’t want to hear anything else about this, I don’t want to know. 

I can’t stop thinking about this and the implications it will have on their already drawn out divorce. I am extremely unhappy with my mom for dumping this on me, seemingly just to get me to put down my dad. If I’m being honest, I don’t even think my dad did anything wrong. At this point, their “marriage” is just a legal term that they’re working on removing. I think she’s wildly overreacting and she’s being selfish by involving me, after I explicitly told her not to. But I also know affairs are wrong. But does this even count as an affair?

Before anyone says it, I’m already going back to therapy to try to unpack this. But AITA for not being mad at my dad and being borderline furious with my mom after my dad had an affair?

TLDR: my parents hate each other and are going through a divorce. my mom told me my dad was having an affair after I explicitly said I didn’t want either of them talking to me about the other because I have a lot on my plate and have historically not handled the familial stress well. AITA for being pissed at my mom for talking shit and not caring about my dad’s actions?"
982,d7d60a,"WIBTA if I went to the police over a stolen bird? This all happened recently so I’m a bit emotional still. A month ago I rescued a starving baby pigeon. Her nest was gone, her parents gone, other pigeons were attacking her, and she was obviously dehydrated and malnourished because her feathers weren’t growing in correctly, so I took her in and started hand feeding her. I did the whole momma bird thing where I chewed up nuts into a paste and fed them to her with a simulated crop. 

After a bit a “friend” (I’ll explain the quotes later) offered to help since she had experience with bird rehabilitation. I agreed and we moved her to her apartment. Never once did I say she could have her as I had planned on building an outdoor coop and keeping her, which I told her. Anyway, I bought the necessary food and supplies and visited her at least twice a weak to help with the care. I made it abundantly clear I was still the primary owner of the bird. The whole time this “friend” kept making comments about growing attached to the bird, she tried renaming her, and started to plan moving to another state with the bird. I told her repeatedly I wanted her back before that. At that point she started acted weird. 

I understand her attachment to the bird, but she never once even asked me if she could keep her. She basically just decided it was hers and stopped allowing me over. Fast forward to yesterday, she posted on Facebook asking for a bird sitter when she’s out of town for a month. This came as a surprise because since the day she took that bird home I made it very clear I wanted her back when she goes on her trip. I’m pretty attached to the bird. I haven’t had a pet since moving half way across the world and I’m pretty lonely overall. 

I messaged her asking what’s up, and in return I get a series of texts about how I’m an unfit owner, how I’m a child and then she started trying to gaslight me into think the bird doesn’t like me. Um, ok I must have done something wrong here? I try to be nice and say that I’m not trying to start anything and I’m really sorry she’s so upset with me. I ask her what I have done wrong. She then mocks me for being emotional and tells me she doesn’t have time for my shit. 

So at this point I feel backstabbed. This lady stole my bird and painted me as a bad guy. We had just hung out, I thought we were friends?

I called the local police non emergency line and asked them a few questions and said my pet bird was stolen from me by my pet sitter. They told me to fill out a police report and indicated she could be charged with theft.   

I’ve held off filing the report in the hopes she would cam down and maybe apologize, but she has yet to respond to a single message.

Would I be the asshole if I filed a police report for theft?

I remember everything that was done to me which caused me to have severe confidence issues all throughout my life but I never told anyone.

Jen's family helped out my parents a lot when they were first married and helped them until they could support themselves.

985,e4vgi8,"WIBTA for using a friends dead mother to try and snap him out of MGTOW? Hi,  
I have a friend that has recently been expressing a view that women are worth less than men, that only men should hold power and women  should obey men. That a man does not need a women for anything and they  only keep them down.

He has been saying things like women today think too much of themselves and that he owns his own home and pays his bills, all this with out them. Thing is he doesn't.  


At the start of the year his mother passed suddenly from stage 4 cancer, they found out she had it two months before, it hit him very hard as she was the only parent he ever had. His mother raised him and his sister as a single mother, paying off the house and supporting them both. He has lived out of home maybe a total of year in the 10 odd years I have known him, currently in his early 30s   
 

When she died he was left a large sum of money, the house and all bills were paid for in advance by several thousand.  
After he got the money he quit his job, saying that he wont have to  work for years to come, he also placed an unknown amount into crypto  currency and has no plan to study anything in the future.  
 

The only qualification I am aware he has is a certificate in childcare.  
 

Regard the bills the only reason I know this is when the first  bills started rolling in after his mothers death he wanted help  understanding the bills, water, power and rates and what they meant, I  was explaining things like cr meant credit, how the bill was broken down and such.   
 

I want to use his dead mother to say that he does not own the  house, he was given it, by his mother, who worked hard her whole life as  a single mother to support him and his sister. He is only in this  position now as she had the forethought to make the  next few months / years as easy as possible for him, that saying this  stuff about women is disparaging everything his mother ever did for him. 

That she would be more than pissed in his new found way of life. 

The other option I am also leaning towards is just cutting ties, and leaving him to his own vices.

Thoughts?

TLDR

Friend is going mgtow, only reason he is doing well is his mother who recently died left him everything to do it, want to use his mothers death to tell him to snap out of it and grow the fuck up."

We grow our own food and try to live as minimally as possible. Most of our friends live the same way and we are a very close knit friend group. We also smoke lots of weed, it's pretty much our go-to recreational activity. Unfortunately for us, we live in the conservative south and out sate is NOT legal. Another couple in our group had a baby a few years ago. At first they were pretty good about not exposing their baby to pot smoke or just weed in general but slowly this has started to change. Now they smoke weed all-day every-day in front of the child.

 You go over to their house and the 2ft bong is out out on the kitchen table with the weed just sitting out right next to it. They have started bringing the child to our chill and smoke sessions too.

I DO NOT THINK THEY ARE BAD PARENTS. They take great care of their child and love them immensely. They just have the mindset that weed *should* be legal and that there isn't anything wrong with it, so no need to hide it from their child.

988,d4puvd,"AITA for being mad at my bf over a DnD game? My bf introduced me to DnD about a year ago and I got really into it. I always wanted to play but never had any that played, so I was really glad when I got the chance.

For the last few months he has been DM'ing ""Curse of Strahd"" for our group and we are having a blast. However, I began to crave more variety, and asked him to DM a parallel campaign for us. He was not really into the idea but suggested that I could DM a parallel campaign instead. I got really nervous bc I've never done it before, but he bugged me so much that I ended up caving with a few conditions: that he would help me prepare the games and with the rules, and that he would assist me in character that the game would go more smoothly and not go off the rails.

I chose to run the first campaign from ""Tales from the Yawning Portal"", something short so I could get the hang of it. It began well, but soon enough stuff started to go off the rails, and the main problem was my bf's character. He's playing a bard, but every. god. damn. combat he gets his ass knocked out. That wouldn't be much of a deal if he wasn't the ONLY support character in the party. So every single time he gets knocked out everyone has to wait for him to wake up. My other players have gotten so sick of dragging his unconscious ass around that they are considering just murdering him so they don't have to deal with this shit anymore.

Even worse is that it's 100% his fault this is happening. He just puts himself on harms way because... lol? And multiple times I tried to fudge the rules to help him but he starts to argue with me because of it.

For example: our rogue was attacking with her crossbow and she rolled a critical fail. He insisted that she had to hit a party member. So I said she hit the fighter, but he insisted that I should roll the dice to decide who got hit. And I rolled the his character was hit. And he got knocked out. Again.

After this happened I just ended it for that day, very frustrated, and we had a huuuuge fight after. I know it's just a game, but he's just ruining the fun for everyone, especially mine. If it was any other player that was doing this stupid shit, I wouldn't have minded, but he had promised to me that he would help me to make the game more smoothly. He says I'm being silly, cause the DM has to just deal with shit like that and improvise, but it's my first time and I'm not yet that comfortable with this role, and nervous as heck, and don't need the extra pressure.

So, AITA? And people more experienced than me in DM'ing, is there something I can do to fix it?"

Back in August my wife, sister in law and my brother made plans to go to Hawaii for spring break this year. My brother and sister in law are in the final year of college, I took off a week from work, and my wife is a teacher so she had the week off. Anyway plans were made, tickets purchased and then my parents who had originally told us they did not want to go as they were eyeing a cruise at the same time, decided that we were horrible as we should have known they really wanted to go.

This is typical behavior by them but as they live in another city thousands of miles away we do not have to deal with them often and grin and bare it when we do. Anyway they pouted until we got them tickets, which I had to pay for even though my parents are very well off and easily could afford plane tickets on their own.

Two weeks later my parents mention their good friends also got tickets and would be joining us. Now we are pissed because we had our trip planned down to a t, and my parents and their friends were not going to want to do half the things we wanted to do.

So I made my parents aware that since they hijacked our vacation, they were responsible to arrange for plans for their friends and themselves. My mom became agitated and said that what is the point of a family vacation if we were going to do our own thing. I responded that it was not a family vacation because she invited their friends therefore they needed to come up with their own itnerary. I did tell her what we planned on doing and they were welcome to join but she shot down everything we planned on doing.

Fast forward to this week we all met up at the airport and although we were all at the same resort, I was confident we would still have a good time. We would do our thing and they would do ours...

Nope every tour we left to go on, a passive aggressive tone was taken about how this was a family vacation and why do we hate them and not want to spend time with them. My parents and their friends did the same two things all week, go sit on the beach and drank themselves silly. Sorry I am not wasting my week of vacation getting sloppy drunk. The last night (Thu night) after a dinner in which my parents friends got completely sloshed and my parents berated the waitress because she dare cut off said friends, words were said.

It ended in a ugly argument, we told them they were rude and assholes (not in those exact words) for basically hijacking what was supposed to be a fun trip and ruining it.

990,bfacqq,"AITA for sending gay/trans porn to a man who messaged me randomly for nudes? So tonight an old man that I didn’t know messaged me for nudes on Facebook. I had no mutual friends with him, didn’t even live in the same state. I have no idea who he is or how he found me. 

I replied with a few memes(sponge bob drinking bleach, a little girl giving a “wtf” look to her iPad, and a guy throwing up a peace sign) and a screenshot from a trans porn video. He messaged back asking what my answer was. I requested $50.(no intention of ever sending nudes. Honestly I was taking suggestions from my friends on what to say/send at this point) He said I was funny. I told him off, basically saying messaging young girls for nudes was never acceptable. He called me a bitch. I sent him screenshots from gay porn. He called me a fag. I sent him more screenshot and said that I was a girl, he was a boy, and he looked at the pictures, so he was the gay one. He said I was probably an fat boy in my moms basement. I said “yep. You found me out. And you want to see me naked. I’m glad you’re finally coming out as gay. Being true to yourself is a wonderful thing” he said thank you. I said “you’re welcome. The LGBT community accepts you.” 

I then posted it in a drama group online. People have went off. I deleted it cuz I didn’t realize I was being offensive, and I certainly didn’t mean to be. I was trying to get the point across that asking young girls for nudes wasn’t acceptable, just like sending people porn isn’t acceptable. Now it’s been reposted and I’m getting even more hate for dirty deleting it.

991,atebul,AITA for being a army football fan. Never attended Army West Point.  Never served.  Cheer for Army and wear Army football gear.  I was walking on campus when a ROTC dude i know saw me wearing my army football sweatshirt and asked if i served.  I said no.  He got angry and said I shouldnt rep army gear unless if im in the army.  I said it was a sweatshirt you could buy on there website.  He stormed off.   Later he messaged me saying my actions were disgusting and I was stealing valor.  AITA for wearing army football gear.?
992,c3he29,"AITA for wasting food at a restaurant in front of children? I went out for dinner a while back with a group of friends, some with children between the ages of around 5 to 8. I was informed beforehand by a friend that it would be a buffet, and I say okay.

We reach the restaurant and I urgently want to go to the toilet, so I go just as soon as we have been showed our table.  I come back to the table and see plates with food on them, and waiters serving food. Turns out that it's the kind where the waiter serves the unlimited food on the table, and not the serve-yourself kind, which was what I was expecting.

I sit down at my empty seat, and there's a plate with several kinds of starters on it. I'm informed by my friends that this is for me. I look at my plate, and see a lot of food I strongly dislike and never touch - mushroom, corn etc. In addition, there's a pretty huge amount of food because I wasn't there while the waiter was serving the food and they tend to serve a good amount there unless you specifically tell them. I try to eat some of it, but dislike it more than I thought I would, so I eat a small part of it, and  left the remaining so that I could better enjoy dishes I might like later on. I ask if anybody else wants anything from my plate, everyone declines.

Everything is going fine until the waiter comes to clear the plates. I make a gesture for my plate to be cleared too and just as it about to be picked up, one friend stops the waiter. She asks me if I'm going to eat any of that, and I say no. Immediately, she gets mad and tells me I shouldn't be wasting this much food because (a) there are kids starving around the world and I'm being disrespectful and (b) it would set a bad example for their kids who might think its okay to waste food.

I generally don't waste food, and I told them why this time felt like an exception. Additionally, I see no point in eating more food when you don't want to. Almost everyone in the table strongly opposed this, and a few them got really mad when I continued to refuse to eat that particular plate of food. In their defense, we live in a country where poverty is slightly more abundant and children are often taught from a young age not to waste food.

So... AITA?"
993,bw8l90,"WIBTA if I donated my step-daughter's stuff and gave away her pet? I (32f) have a step-daughter (17) that we'll call Ashley. She came to live with us about a year ago when her mom moved out of state and she didn't want to go.

It's been a rough year. She had a lot of mental health issues, and ended up dropping out of high school and attending a full time therapy program. She finished the program, but got little out of it. She now stays in bed 24/7 watching Netflix and smoking weed all day.

Her dad and I have been trying really hard to get her to do basically anything. We enrolled her in online school. She lied about doing her work, and got kicked out. We signed her up for community college classes, she didn't go. I helped her get a job at my work, and she got fired before she started for not filling out the paperwork.

I guess she got tired of us pressuring her, and she waited for us to leave for work, and she packed her bags and flew to her mom's house. Evidentally they have been planning this for months. I am not sure why they didn't just tell us, because we wouldn't have been mad. We were planning on talking to her mom to see if she thought she'd do better there. Instead they said nothing and we were worried sick because we had no idea where she was. They actually did this once before. She lived with us for a few years and went for a visit to her mom's, and never came back. Her mom moved and wouldn't give us the new address for over 6 months.

When her dad texted her a few days ago, she said everything is his fault and she's done talking to him forever. Honestly, he has done so much for her. He has always been there for her, so he is super hurt by this. 

When she left, she just left everything in her room, including a bearded dragon (with no food or water). I have reached out to her several times over the past week to see if she has a plan to get her stuff, or if she wanted us to ship it to her. I would just ship most of it, but just like last time, we don't have their address. She hasn't responded to any of our texts or calls.

My plan is to leave her room as is for 30 days, then pack up all of her pictures/yearbooks and anything else that looks important. Everything else I will donate. A friend of mine who loves animals offered to take the bearded dragon.

We have a small house so storing all of her stuff indefinitely would really be hard.

So, WIBTA for donating her stuff and giving away her bearded dragon? Or as parents should we store her stuff until some day she can come get it? Her dad and I are both emotional and really hurt right now. We hope to rebuild our relationship with her some day, so I just want to make sure we're doing the right thing."
994,b3t0cb,"AITA for being upset parents took a baby to a touring production of the Sound of Music? Last week I went to see the touring production of the Sound of Music with a few friends. I’m a huge fan of musicals and I try to see as many as I can. Since I’m still a student, I can purchase tickets at a discounted price ($20 instead of $200 for similar seats). 

Twice during the first act and again during the second act a baby started crying during the show. It happened during some of the more serious moments of the show and I was very annoyed. 

I turned to my friends during intermission and after the show and said: who brings a baby to a show? I was really annoyed but my friends (who aren’t usually theatre goers) thought it was no big deal. They said maybe the parents couldn’t get a babysitter or something and I should have empathy for the parents.

Am I the asshole for having no sympathy for the parents? If you can’t make arrangements for your baby, then you can’t go see a play or musical.  Wait until the kid is old enough to control their actions and possibly even enjoy the show. It’s not like you can easily leave the theatre if the baby decides its time to cry. It’s dark and it takes a minute to maneuver to the door. It’s a situation the parents can avoid (unlike babies crying in the supermarket or on a plane). 

What do you think? AITA?

995,eibw1d,"AITA for getting the police involved? I’ll try to explain this the best I can. My mom kicked me out at 16. I was constantly bouncing back and forth between sleeping in my car, on floors and couches. I joined the military. At this time I was staying at a friends house. Before I left for training my mom wanted to try to work things out. She asked what my plan for my car. I didn’t trust leaving at the place I was staying at. My friends sister came home drunk and stole my car. I didn’t trust leaving it there for months with her. So I left it at my moms. The car was under my name and insurance. I told her that no one was allowed to drive it and the only thing she could do was turn it on and let it run. I called my insurance company to let them know I’m leaving for training and that nobody was allowed to drive my car. I did this so they can have a note in my file because I know how my mom is. I left for training and once I got into the second part of my training I received text messages from my step dad. My step dad and mom were going through a sloppy divorce and my moms boyfriend was already living with her(relevant for later). He told me that my step brother was driving my car to learn how to drive. I found out my moms boyfriend was driving it to his work and he works 7 days a week. He drives it two hours there and back and he screwed up my transmission. I told my friend to go pick up my car. I told my mom to leave the key in my car. So my mom called her insurance and put my car under her insurance. My friend goes to pick it up and my mom comes outside and tells her she can’t because it’s under her insurance and she will call the cops. My friend left and when she gets home she tells me the whole situation. So the next day I call the local police department and explain the situation and one of the officers escorts her out there. So my mom pulls the same thing. My friend calls me and explains I tell her to grab my insurance and registration out of the car and give it to the officer. She puts me on speaker and I tell them that she can drive my car. I ask her how many miles were on it, she tells me the number. They put on over 50,000 miles in a period of 8 months and this was a newer car. She told me the ABS and CEL were on. Months go buy and I come home to get my car. I went to a shop and asked them to check it out. The codes were coming up because of the transmission and someone put two extra quarts of oil into my car. He said I’m lucky got it checked out before I left. So I text my mom and ask her about the miles and extra oil. I hadn’t talked to her until now because I was mad. She told me the miles were because everyone in the house was using my car (6 people), she said they used it to not put miles on their cars. They also went on a couple vacations. She then admitted that her boyfriend put the oil in my car hoping that it would destroy the car because he was pissed I was having my friend take my car and it inconveniences him. She put it on Facebook and people are saying I’m the asshole. AITA for having the police get involved?"
996,cojdbi,"AITA for not wanting my fiance to pick a mutual friend to be a groomsman? Apologies for the large amount of backstory. My fiance is a very devout Christian. I am not practicing and am closer to agnostic than anything else. This actually prevented us from dating for a while. We went out, and he said he didn't think it would work out. I was bummed but agreed. A few months later, we reconnected, and about a year after we first met he told me he'd changed his mind and wanted to give it another shot.

Before we started dating again, we had a mutual friend, whom I'll name Alex, who is very Christian as well. The months leading up to me and my fiance starting to date, I would sometimes hang out with Alex one on one, go on runs with him, etc. All three of us would sometimes hang out all day playing video games. We were good friends.

Anyway, when my fiance finally asked me out, he mentioned he wanted to find a way to break the news to Alex. I was too dense to realize at the time that the ""breaking the news"" had just as much to do with Alex having a thing for me as Fiance telling Alex he was dating someone outside the church.

When Fiance finally told Alex, Alex asked Fiance to meet him, and they scheduled to go hang out a night I was out of town. When I got back, Fiance was acting weird and distant. It turned out that whatever Alex had said to him really bothered him and was making him have more doubts about our relationship. We almost broke up.

Over the next several months, I found out what happened. Alex had basically tried to convince Fiance dating outside of the church (aka me) was a bad idea. I also found out Alex had even suggested books to Fiance that said as much. I can't see this as anything but him trying to break us up. Fiance says it wasn't really like that but I don't get how suggesting books that talk about the perils of dating non-Christians can be anything else. Ever since I found all this out, I have been unable to reform a friendship with Alex. He was supposed to be my friend, and instead of being happy for us, he tried to make religion get between us. I've tried forgiving him but whenever I see him now I can't think of anything else.

Alex is still in our friend group, knew both of us before we were dating, and is almost certainly expecting to be a groomsman. We're having a small wedding, and I've figured out the bridesmaids, but Fiance has yet to decide on groomsmen. When we were talking about it last night, Alex's name came up. I told Fiance that Alex being in the wedding made me uncomfortable because of how he treated our early relationship, and how I see what he did as betrayal. I understand why he would pick him and ultimately it is his choice, and I will respect whomever he chooses. But I still don't like it. He's one of Fiance's friends and I get it, but what he did hurt me, even if Fiance says I don't fully understand since I don't have the same ideas on marrying in the church. AITA?"
997,b91dil,"AITA for eating lunch without my girlfriend? On Sunday, my girlfriend said she wanted to surprise me with a gift at noon for today. She wouldn't tell me what the gift is so I assumed it was something like a card she wrote for me (our anniversary is coming up and she loves arts and crafts).

The next day, I accidentally spoiled a TV series for her that she was watching and she got mad at me. She texted me ""Don't talk to me"". I apologized, saying I didn't know she didn't get up to that part yet and she left me on seen. I think alright, she'll get over this later. She never responded back so I got petty for her ignoring me for something I didn't mean to do intentionally.

We had no contact since then (until today) and I thought she was still upset with me so I went out to grab lunch with my coworkers a little before noon. She messages me at noon, telling me she's downstairs and to pick up her gift for me. I told her I went out for food because I didn't think she would still pull through today because she was mad and ignored me. She told me to pick it up anyway.

I got my food to go, met up with her, and picked up my gift. I asked her what it was but she wouldn't tell me. She looked sad, which I assumed was because she thought I was upset with her (I was because she ignored me for 2 days). I hugged her and she started crying and that made me feel really bad but she told me it was ok and she left. I went back to work, ate my food, then looked at the gift (it was in a big bag) and found out that it was food for two. She planned on eating lunch with me but because she didn't tell me anything beforehand and I was being petty, I ended up eating my own lunch before opening her gift and finding out it was food for the both of us.

I feel terrible because she was probably looking forward to it today but she ended up leaving sad and hungry. AITA for eating my own lunch because she didn't specify she got me food as a gift?"
998,eryzs6,"AITA for airing my concerns about family vacation to MIL? So my husbands family has decided to go on a week long family trip for his grandparents 60th anniversary. It’s approx 24 people total. Half of the family will be staying in his aunt and uncles time-share home (four bedrooms), and the other half would be staying in a rental house a few blocks away (four bedrooms). Unfortunately, with these arrangements, the family would still be a few bedrooms short. Nobody, expected the whole family to want to go, and stay the whole week, but alas, here we are. As of right now, one couple (both females), would be sharing a bunk room with their two sisters (and possibly one sisters boyfriend). And my husband and I have been elected to sleep in an air mattress in the living room. Being that we are the youngest, without kids, it makes the most sense. There had been some talk on various people looking into hotel rooms or renting a third place, but nothing was set in stone. There is possibility that if one cousin’s husband didn’t come, she and her daughter would share a tiny room off of the side of her parents room, which would free up a bedroom for someone else. But that wouldn’t be known until a month or so prior. 

Originally, my husband and I were looking into going for only a few days, but situations changed and we would like to go for the whole week now. However, I explained to my husband that I wouldn’t be comfortable going for the whole week if we indeed were sleeping on the air mattress. I don’t care so much about comfort, but privacy. We would have nowhere to go if we needed some quiet time away from the family, or wanted to rest in the middle of the day. We would be woken up when the first person woke up (probably 6 am), and would be up until the last person went to sleep. We would have nowhere to change and would have to wait for the two bathrooms.  We are paying a good bit for this vacation that wasn’t originally budgeted for, so i want us to enjoy it and be comfortable. My husband seemed to agree with me. I brought this up to MIL , who also seemed to agree. Husband was with me when I was talking to MIL.

Now two days after our talk, MIL and FIL offered to take the air mattress, and I felt awful. So I told them that we would just take it. Now the family is looking into getting an additional place or larger place, which in turn will increase the trip cost for everybody. Husband, who originally agreed with all of my points, is now telling me that I shouldn’t have aired my complaints to his mother and “I don’t know when to keep my mouth shut”. He seemed very upset with me and hung up the phone when we were talked

So, AITA?

Edit- sounds like the current plan is to either switch from a 4 bedroom place to a 6 bedroom place, or get an additional two bedroom place and share with MIL/ FIL. Husband is still upset that my speaking up caused all this stress."

After a while someone asks me if the messages he receives are from the class messenger group (because we are classmates and I should get them too). I checked and I find that my sister logged her fb account in my phone (mom took away her phone) so I didn't receive any messages. And here I saw it. My friend telling me that I, again, ignore her for hours and don't respond to her messages. I calmly told her that I didn't do it on purpose, I was doing something. Mind if I tell you again, I didn't even seen them or got a notification. Continues to say that my behavior is foolish and now will do the same, find another things to do so she won't have to respond.

If one person leaves early because, the counter person will come and help clean up.

Last time I worked by myself, I had deliveries going until 25 minutes before the store closed. I come back from my delivery to find that the counter person hasn’t mopped, sweeped, or helped with the dishes.

1002,c81dfe,"AITA for choosing my own friends? Way back in high-school I went to a private school for my last year. First day I meet this girl in my class and it is very obvious that we kinda look similar because of our hair. We both have abnormally long hair. Her's brown and mine copper-red. No biggie. Well, apparently she thought that this fact meant that we just HAD to be friends. She followed me like a puppy and I didn't really mind. I just didn't see her as a friend since we didn't really have anything in common. We didn't really talk or anything even though we were in the same class. 

&#x200B;

Over the year I get to know just how sheltered and absurd she could be. She rarely bathed and wore see-through shirts so you could see her breasts(she didn't wear a bra and just shrugged when people pointed it out). She had no table manner and I had to sit in front of her while she chewed with her mouth open and used her tongue instead of a napkin.(again, ignored people who politely pointed it out.) In class she would sit and pick her nose/pick at scabs and zits and eat it. She stole from her roommates and defended herself by saying she was gonna replace it so it was okay for her to take it without asking.(Her roomie was so pissed and clearly not okay with this) There is more but this is not about her shortcomings. 

&#x200B;

Anyway she just didn't seem like a person I wanted to hang out with. At first I just tried to put some distance between us but in a small school with only 100 people that seemed to prove difficult. I then talked to her in private and told her that there was a lot of people in the school and that maybe someone else could be a better fit as her friends(Not word for word but that was the general thing I said, so take it with a grain of salt). 

&#x200B;

She did NOT like that. She said she understood but I quickly learned that she now had a grudge against me. Rumors started spreading about me being evil and mean and turning down a poor friendless little girl. People yelled at me in the halls: ""How could you be so cold?"" ""She has no friends!"" ""She just wants to be your friend!"" 

I soon got the nickname ""Witch"" and had a lot of fun being bullied.(More than I already was.) My friend group stayed my friends but they tried to steer clear of the whole thing and ignored the fact that there was a problem for the rest of the year. The teachers were always super cool and tried to stop bullying, but things just happens when backs are turned. 

I never understood why she choose only me or why the 100 other people weren't an option for her. She sadly didn't find any friends.

Again, fine, I'll just get them from her the day before I leave.

My dad is currently getting disemployment check because he got laid off for the time being. I know that the government automatically takes the money out of my dads check so there really isnt much he can do. 

I feel really irritated because instead of taking it up with dad she comes to me as if im able to hurry up the process. So I tell her that ill ask him about it. She proceeds to rant to me about how much she gets is too little and that shes going to take him to court for more money. This brings up a ton of red flags because that could get her in trouble.

I tell her that its not a good idea because I got married off at 16 and from there she wasnt supposed to keep recieving child support. She refused to report that I had left home so my dad was like fine ill pay it but give it to OP. She didnt do that either. I reminded her that if she took him to court they may make her pay him back for what he was overpaying with me. She lost it completely.

My(22f) boyfriend and I recently broke up. It wasn't awesome, but it was relatively amicable, and we're hoping we can work towards being friends in the future. 

I told my parents about the split and some general info on why. I'd like to make it clear that *my parents are not close with this ex*
He's been home with me twice for a visit (my parents and I live 200 miles away from each other) and has seen them maybe twice when they've visited me. Everyone got along, but no special bonds were formed. 

Small backstory: my mom has a history of overstepping bounds. Growing up she would highlight passages of my journal and question me on them, to give you an idea. A while back, she called me, must've thought there was something wrong (she asked, there wasn't, I was fine) didn't like my tone, and messaged my bf on Facebook to see if something was up. Asked him not to tell me she did it. He told me, my dad had a chat with her about overstepping boundaries, but told me I wouldn't be getting an apology because it ""wasn't her strong suit""

Fast forward to 2 days post-breakup, she messages my ex again to tell him how heartbroken she is, sends her condolences, tells him she hopes he can find someone new, etc. It makes him uncomfortable, he mentions it to me, it makes me livid. I give her a call, tell her it was inappropriate, that it made both of us uncomfortable, and asked why she thought that would be ok. She gets mad, has my dad ream me out for it. He yelled at me and demanded I apologize. I told him I wouldn't because it isn't my strong suit, if my own mother can't ever apologize to me why should I have to, and i'm not sorry to begin with. They maintain that ex and I are overreacting, that I need to apologize, and that the ""youths of today need to stop being so uncomfortable.""

1006,bq882m,"AITA for kicking out a little girl and her parents from my daughter's birthday party for ruining our photo shoot? Kids 3rd birthday was three days ago. We had a party and invited many of our friends with kids. We made specific mention we're doing a balloon photoshoot for our daughter and any friend who wanted to join in. We got about 30 balloons, set them up outside in an ornate way to get best photos possible. Balloons and bubbles are her favorite things in the whole world it seems, so we think it's a nice treat for her and our photo album.

We're getting my daughter ready inside while we leave everything outside. We get outside and all but four balloons have been popped by this other girl. Her mother is sitting in a lawn chair nearby encouraging her ""okay, now go get that one too!"". It's just a big game of popping a balloon, laughing, egging her on to pop another, et cetera.

We tell this mom to leave with her child. She argued saying she thought we already did it. Never mind *she watched us set it up* and why would we do the photoshoot prior to the party officially beginning? It was just us there, no one else showed up.

30 balloons is what, $5? I know it's not a lot of money but we ended up doing no photoshoot because we didn't want to go out and get more. We planned this, let everyone know in advance, and they still did this to us.

Were we the assholes? FWIW I'm the mother, my husband thought it was funny but was still disappointed. My husband's a photographer, so to clarify we didn't hire someone to take the photos, it was just us."
1007,d45q0c,"AITA for wanting to keep my father and I's coin collection after he said I could keep it after he dies? Pretty much what the title says, my father and I have always had a thing for coin collecting and ever since I can remember I  have added all kinds of coins to our collection since I was a wee laddie. Most of them are just currency from all around the world and from different momentous times in history like our german nazi coins and mao medal. 

So naturally since ive helped him build up the collection he said he put it in his will that I should get it because I actually know how to handle them and what to do with them. But this is where my family comes in, they'd like nothing more but to sell it when hes gone and splitting what it costs because some.of the coins in there are pretty rare  and would fetch a good price. 

To them and my mom theyre just pieces of useless metal that we could've sold to help out long ago, but my dad has always been there to stop them from doing so and they cant help but be mad that he wants to pass it down to me so I wont get rid of our collection.  They would rather see it sold to the highest bidder because in all honesty my father doesnt have much to give anyway and our collection is the only thing thats worth anything and they'd be left with ""the scraps"" .

But I dont want to get rid of it in the event of his death, theyre worth more than any money to me. Its an accumulation of my dads lifetime of collecting and my own since I was small. I'd rather keep it till I'm old and able to pass it down to my children to add to and if theyre not into that sort of thing then have it donated to a museum in my fathers name. Those are the only two things I see doing any justice to my fathers legacy.

1008,b8azyq,"AITA for cutting my friend off because she's homophobic Hi, this is actually my first post on reddit after lurking for so long, i apologize im on mobile rn so the formating isn't the best. im just really frustrated and idk if im wrong

So i met this girl in middleschool  i'll call her jd (her initials) we were pretty great friends for a few years and then we started to drift away. Nothing major but we just weren't into the same stuff anymore and we still hung out as a friend group. From my point of view there was no hard feelings we just weren't as close. (i used to have feelings for her a bit back but that doesn't matter in this context)
I came out to one of our mutual friends as queer (im pan but idk back then) and she took it ok.She promised she won't tell anyone but told a bunch of people (i live in Serbia and most people are very conservative) and jd ended up being one of them.
After that jd started acting weird around me and would occasionally cancel plans if she knew i was coming. I thought she just felt weird about me liking girls and i let it go. Fast forward a few moths she actually moved to a different city.
I found out later by the friend i came out to that jd was talking shit with a bunch of our friends in a group chat I WAS IN. She was saying how she's disgusted by lesbian relationships and she'd disown her child if they were gay, but also said that 2 men in a relationship is hot.
ofc i was mad but there's even more tea
My friend messaged jd privately to tell her she was being an asshole and jd told her how me liking girls is just a phase and that i'll find a boyfriend soon.
Now nothing annoys me more than that and immidiately cut off all contact.


My friend is saying that im mad at jd for  a stupid reason, and is saying im a huge dick bc jd wants to be friends again (without apologizing ofc) and idk if she's right.

1009,c497t6,"AITA for not hitting her up after a weird situation? 22/F here. I met this group of girls while I was out one night a few months ago and we had a great night hanging out at the various clubs and bars that night. They were from out of town. 

One of the girls recently moved to my city and hit me up. She is in a very awkward living situation w her roommate: they hooked up and she didn’t know how to feel about it. 

We hung out once before w a few friends of mine. I wanted to make her feel like she had a new home here bc it sounded like she moved here in haste, out of an other bad situation. Last night she invited me to a get together at her place w her friends from her hometown. 

Upon meeting the roommate, we share maybe one significant interaction that I recall. Talked about where he gets his weed from in town. Shared a chair during King’s Cup (and there was no funny business there, literally perched on opposite corners of the chair since we were short on seats.) 

Later on in the night during beer pong, my new “friend” tells me she still has feelings for him but she thinks he’s into me. She asked me (told me really) not to go after him, to which I responded “I’m not going to - that’s all you.”  I really didn’t even know the guy’s name, and I wasn’t interested in sabotaging this new friendship by sleeping w her love interest/roommate. 

Long story short, she didn’t believe me. We were both cross-faded but toward the end of BP she ran to her friends and started expressing to them her feelings about me and her roommate. Idk if it was the weed or the liquor, but suddenly the atmosphere felt hostile. She let me know that people were wrapping it up, and I dipped out to meet up w a couple other friends. I was confused at first but I took the hint and got out of that situation. 

After leaving, she texts me: “thanks for coming! Are you texting (roommate’s name) i think he’s into you” 

Like??  Girl... I shut that shit down by saying “Nope we didn’t exchange contact info.” The truth. 

Anyway, weird night. AITA for recognizing how I can’t do anything about her insecurities and letting this new friendship fizzle? It sucks bc I could really see us being great friends."

For some important background, my friend was recently diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and ADHD, after missing over 50 classes and finally relenting to try and see a therapist. Now, administration has told him he must sign a contract that says he will not miss more than 40 classes, lest he get his schedule put ‘on hold’ (paused till they decide a way to handle it). 

He says that this is vastly unfair, and gave the administrator extreme attitude, and is complaining non stop. 

I told him that I thought he needed to find bette coping mechanisms for his problems than immediately going home, and he snapped at me, and said (verbatim);

“You don’t know what you’re talking about. Don’t you dare tell me how to cope.”

I snapped back that if he doesn’t listen to me, he’ll need to listen to administration, lest he face far bigger consequences.

He told me I didn’t have the required info to make a distinction on the best way for him to cope, and I said 

“Clearly the way you’re coping now isn’t working, and the real world isn’t going to accommodate for your entitlement.” 

He turned, and left class halfway through, shutting down anymore discussion. We haven’t talked since

TLDR; I told my friend he needs to learn better coping skills, he got mad, and I told him the real world won’t work the way he wants.

1011,e5q29v,"WIBTA if I got another job so I didn't have to work with my dad Basically, my dad's one of those parents who want their kid to be their best friend. I'm sure it would be sweet if he didn't constantly tell me how stupid I am, and criticize my every action. He's the kind of dad who tells his kid he's going to be a worthless nothing because he got a C+ in math, and physically intimidate/guilt-trip his kid if he has panic attacks as a result of extremely loud screaming.  
So, not the \*best\* guy, but he is extremely sensitive. He's been unemployed for several years while I've been working a job as a lead at a theme park. The only people who work this job are teenagers, or any job at this theme park for that matter. I quit my job at the start of this semester to focus on college applications and my AP courses, and originally planned on reapplying to my old job this week.   
It turns out my dad has similar plans. He plans on applying for a job for teenagers because in his words, it's fun. But I get the sense that there's more to it. He's had a bit of a tendency to threaten stalking me if I go away to college (""You think I won't follow you if you go to Utah? I'll always just drive there, I don't have a job""), and this seems to be an extension of that. I fear that he'll follow me around the theme park during breaks and intimidate me, but because he's my dad there'll be nothing I can do legally.

&#x200B;

Even just his presence makes me incredibly nervous, I can barely do anything without my hands shaking and my voice wavering if I even think he might be around because I know if I say something wrong, he'll yell at me for it when I get home. This should be reason enough to find a different line of work, which won't be difficult, I'm just worried this is unnecessarily spiteful towards him, even though this feels like it's for myself.

1012,cipm3q,"AITA for getting my whole department under review or even fired I'm working a white collar job as a side gig next to school and we basically boss around a lot of temp college guys in production because of how labour intense it is. 

Even on the best of days our production site is an oven and with recent summers it became a necessity to grant more breaks for employees to cool down, drink up and to losen some guidelines. However there is a group of 3 young professionals that shows major double standards in their oversight. Our good looking temps were treated as expected and the terror squad was constantly concerned about their wellbeing, but you wouldn't notice any of that with everyone else. Any breaks they took were questioned, just like their attitude etc. and they'd be writen up all the time for nothing. Any temp calling it out was immediately shot down with bs about authority, accusations of sexism, sometimes even accusations of sexual harassment. They'd also fawn over the ""eye candy"" and have a good laugh whenever they managed to make someone quit. 

Since I always helped with documenting the inspections I didnt know where they were coming from and thought maybe there's some background I wasnt aware off, but noticed that even temps hired after me were bullied out of the job and decided to do sth about it.

Basically for the last half year I've been collecting all those write ups, resignations, CVs and records of temps, personal documentation and even some voice recordings of their harassment and office gossip. I had enough and decided to bring it up at our monthly department meeting. The terror squad went OFF on me, calling me every name and hinting about me sexually harassing them and I'd have crapped my pants right then if it wasn't for my bf and browser history vouching for my disinterest in their gender.

As you might expect my next week was quite eventful. Appearently boss told the terror clique they should start looking for new employment, but he also pulled me into the office and told me that my work was also under scrutiny ""in the light of recent accusations"". I politely told him it wasn't the professionalism I expected and went straight to HR. 

Basically I spend all my time in HR meetings since. They got all the evidence and interviewed everyone they could get their hands on. My boss and the terror clique were bascially standing in front of a execution squad. They are all out of jobs and the whole department is under review now. But apart from the temps everyone is giving me shit for it. They say how I got 3 young professionals and a good boss fired and didn't understand ""subtle"" sexism (yes the department skews young and woke)

Imo they just say bc it landed everyone in hot water, but I had some people kind of seeing their point about how it wasn't up to me if the coworkers felt harassed or not. Fair point in general, but see above, I didnt catch any of it, only their major fuck ups. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.

1013,e71k42,"AITA for not wanting to move back in with my inlaws?  My fiance (26M) and I (24F) have been together for 5 years and have a 3-year old as well. When we first discovered we were pregnant we moved in with his parents who charged us affordable rent and we lived together alright for the most part. There are no big glaring issues living with them, but a list of inconveniences that I believe make it easier to just live separately. Examples:

 the grandparent's feed and give my son whatever he wants instead of asking me first. I'm not a big health nut but no ice cream before bedtime and tons of juice all day instead of just water is bad in my opinion. 

They constantly give me advice on how to raise our son to the point where I have to defend/justify my own choices. 

They fight with each other quite often and it's awkward being in the same house trying to distract a child from yelling. 

They invite my Brother-in-law over whose a rude, druggie that starts fights, and they try to babysit his kid who will literally bite and push my son, throwing tantrums every time they're over. 

They refuse to let me handle my own laundry or clean anything because they rather do it themselves. Living with them has been 40% pleasant and 60% stress and I never feel fully at ease. I worry about any complaint I have offends them, and it makes me feel guilty.

Then they decided to move out down the road to a bigger house where they plan to live forever and host family gatherings. They let my fiance and I lease the current house as our own for 3 months now. We pay 70% of the rent/utilites and they've willing covered the rest. I've been genuinely happier on our own and my fiance has been as well. 

However, my fiance told me last minute there's a good possibility due to money problems, that his parents want to sell the house we're currently living in and have us move back in with them. I immediately got upset and said I rather get an overnight job than live with them. Not only would we be taking our house full of stuff and squished into two rooms, but all the previous issues mentioned would come back. It upset my fiance because he loves his parents and it hurts him that's he not making enough money for us to live on our own. But every time I try to get a job I'm lectured by him and his parents that my job is to watch our son. Now for the positives of living with them, they'll babysit whenever and will pay for anything we want in terms of clothes, medical bills, food. They genuinely love me and my son, but I think to the point where I'm seen as their child instead of a separate adult. My fiance has no issues living with them and just wants everyone to live together happily. Am I the Asshole for rather finding a small apartment/duplex rather than move back in with my In-laws?"

1016,d797ew,"AITA for calling my brother a horrible person at his own family gathering in front of everybody? My brother invited the entire family over to his place for a family dinner get-together, no particular occasion just for catching up. We only see everybody together once every couple months. 

A couple hours in, most of everyone at the table is finished, and we all are talking. Everything was going fine until my brother brings up how a distant relative of ours just bought a very expensive car (around $300k). Everybody, including myself was very proud of him being able to do so. 

For some background info: None of our close family has ever been even close to rich. Everyone else at the table lives a “normal” middle class life. 

Then, my brother mentions that none of us at the table will ever be able to achieve that level of success and we’ll only ever be able to attain max an Audi or a BMW in our lifetime (practically anything under $50k).

I say that’s not necessarily an indicator of success anyway because many people buy luxury cars like Audi, BMW, and Mercedes all of the time and they can’t afford them. But they do it anyway, but that doesn’t mean they’re successful. And I mention often times people who buy those cars can’t actually afford them, as they’re on ridiculous loans or get them repossessed. 

My brother disagrees profusely and continues to debate with me about this. This debate (more of a conversation actually for the most part as it was just calm back and forth of our own personal opinions, and not trying to disprove each other’s opinion) goes on for 20 mins with a couple other people chiming in, but for the most part just being between him and I. 

I realize it’s going on too long and starting to make other people feel uncomfortable as my brother is now starting to get mad so I just say “agree to disagree” and that it’s okay that some people have different definitions of what being able to afford something means. 

He doesn’t accept this at all and continues to argue that my point is stupid and illogical. And that there can only be one definition of affording something. I refuse to talk any further and he starts to get more mad. He then starts making it personal by making comments about my lifestyle and how I have a “poor mentality” and that I will never get far with that. He starts to criticize my personal purchases and talk about how his purchases and lifestyle is more successful than mine. 

I continue to ignore him, until he mentions “you keep that poor ass mentality and when you finally save up and can only buy a little $20k car, you’ll see it’s a poor, broke ass mentality.”

I then call him a horrible person for being immature and for making a simple debate turn into him belittling me and attacking me personally. I also say that everyone in the family knows he’s a horrible person but no one ever wants to call him out for it. 
It starts to get awkward so shortly after, everybody decides its time to leave and we all end up going home.

AITA for insulting the host in front of the entire family? 

Edit: the initial “debate” was not an argument. In fact, it was more like a conversation for the majority of the 20 mins. The conversation was mostly about our own personal opinion and why it is, not actively trying to disprove each others opinion."
1017,ciqpsy,"AITA for not wanting to clean up after my stepmother's temper tantrum? I recently cleaned out my bedroom closet and found a bunch of board games that have no reason being there. So I put them in the games closet (GC) with all of the other games.

2-3 weeks later (today) my stepmother (SM 53F) finds the games in GC and dislikes where I put them (I put them, on a [small movable drawer, something like this,](https://s.shld.net/is/image/Sears/854185712-qm-$cq_width_160$-qm-$cq_width_160$) as there was not that much room in GC). SM told me I should put them back in my closet. I responded by telling her there is no room in my closet and it belongs in GC with the other games. So SM told me that when she is ready she would be able to put the games in GC, but in the meantime, they have to be in my closet. I asked her what she meant by ""when she is ready,"" to which she tells me they can be in the attic, and I agreed. (To clarify, she doesn't want me to be the one to put them in the attic).

A few hours later SM tells my father (DAD) to call me to tell me to put the games in my closet. So I come downstairs so I can handle the situation. SM immediately jumps to start telling me how all the games have to be in my bedroom closet (this is all in front of the guests we had over for the weekend). I take a look at the games and take out the ones that nobody will ever play, put them on the floor and say that they can go to the attic, and the remaining 3 games, people might want to play with at some point (Risk, Monopoly, and Chess if that makes a difference ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ ).

SM tells me that her kids won't use them, and they should not be in GC. So I take one of the games and put them on top of some other games in GC and the other 2 can go to the attic. SM doesn't like this and starts telling me how it doesn't belong in GC anyway and should all be in the attic or my room. So I say that the one game fits in GC. SM responds by throwing the three games on the floor breaking one of them (it was in a wooden box) in the process. As this is happening I start to walk back upstairs.

As I am walking upstairs SM got more upset and told me to come back downstairs, and DAD that I have to clean up after her. DAD told me I should clean up her mess or leave, so I agree and go to pack my stuff.

A few minutes later, DAD comes to my room to yell about how I have have to clean up and I am not allowed to take his second option. So I tell him how I'm not cleaning up after her and that what she did was wrong. He tells me that he'll deal with her later but now I have to clean up. I say no and he leaves.

1021,eoscvm,"AITA for going against my cousins 'parenting techniques' So currently my family is on holiday and we are all staying in the same hotel, my cousin (30M) has 2 children, (6M and 8F) and sometimes he can be (in my opinion) cruel to them whilst trying to punish them, not in any physical way but emotionally amd verbally, and before you ask, he's not being inherently unreasonable with what he is punishing but he is being unreasonable with how he does it (imo, once again). 


So the first incident of this was whilst he was cooking hotdogs for his kids in his unit, and his son was giving him a bit of trouble with his hotdog saying it was too hot and that it had a hole in it, my cousin could obviously be seen getting more agitated until finally his son dropped the hotdog on the couch he was sitting on and sause went everywhere, the next thing you hear is ""What the fuck did I tell you?!!"", he started crying amd ran to his room, my cousin later came out and told him to clean all the tomato sauce up with his bare hands or he would be staying in the room for the duration of the holiday.


The next instance was when his daughter asked my aunt (her grandmother) if she could install a minecraft lookalike game on her phone, now she had been told that she was not to download munecraft because it was inappropriate for her, so when dad found out boy was she in trouble, my cousin called her 'deceptive' and 'manipulative' and said she was banned from using the phone.


Her daughter later that day accidentally dropped her tablet and it landed on tiles, my cousin then told her she had smashed the screen and told her to ""go to your fucking room"", she was in tears and later on it turned out there was no crackes at all. 


The last straw came when we were having dinner one night and she said she didn't want to finish the last of the chicken on her plate and my cousin said that she was not getting any desert and then proceeded to get the other 3 kids desert whilst constantly reminding his daughter that she wasn't getting one (not even telling her to finish her dinner at this point) and then told her to sit with the other kids as they ate their desert. She ran off crying again so I decided to take her to my room and give her some of my ice cream to cheer her up, I told her that her dad was being a bit mean but also told her that in future you should only put what you can eat on your plate so you aren't wasting food. I took her back into the other room and my cousin saw her with ice cream and grabbed it off her and demanded to know who gave it to her, I said I did and he called me an asshole who doesn't respected other parents parenting techniques.

It's a bit older than I've been playing and ever since I started, I've wanted this rare costume set. It was big when a little noob but I've only been able to get the necessary in game money to purchase them a year ago. They were one of the first sets to enter the game and they're next to impossible to find now. My SO's decked out in its polar opposite, same scenario. He had wanted his set ever since he started and he's been watching the market like a hawk for the pieces. I found out that he and a friend had also been watching for the pieces that I wanted. A little while previously, they had an event where you could wear the full set I wanted for a single day. I ran around in it, enjoyed it, found that I liked the look and feel of the cheap costume that I had been wearing up until then better, and generally let my craving wash away. I told my SO this, but it seems to have slipped his memory. I first realized that he and our friend were watching the market for the pieces when they rushed excitedly to me to announce that someone was selling the top part of the costume. There are 6 costume pieces and two accessory pieces. The accessories are wonderfully expensive and completely out of my price range, the top part, bottom part, gloves, and shoes are feasible. The hair part and weapon I never expected to get. I never planned to wear the set unless I had the weapon part or else it would break up the current set that I have. All in all, I considered it a pointless endeavor. When my SO came to tell me about the piece on sale, I told him to forget about it. I didn't have enough money at the time to buy it anyway, but he did. He told me over and over to get one but I refused. Eventually after I had gone to sleep for the night, he logged onto my account, transferred the money, and bought the item. I thought, what the hell, might as well go for it now. We managed to get the gloves and shoes, but his enthusiasm dropped after that. He used to watch the board constantly for it, but now doesn't care about it at all and I learned from others that the bottom part had come for sale but it was long gone. I searched halfheartedly on my own with no luck. Now a new costume set has come and I want to attempt obtaining, but when I mentioned to my SO that I wanted to sell the costume he got for me to get it, he got upset. I told him that I hadn't wanted that costume before he got it for me nor did I want it afterwards. He had been the one truly excited about it but he puttered out and now it's rotting in my inventory. He told me that he thought I was refusing to purchase the top in the first place because I had wanted to try to get it on my own. 

I feel like an asshole but sometimes I just want to toss the costume on the floor and walk away from it. All it's caused me is pain. "

Y’alls collective groceries/snacks take up 1/3rd the food storage space, if you need more, let’s talk about making more space.

When they’re here cooking you wash your dishes and wipe the counters after every meal and put them away in a timely fashion. Guest doesn’t leave dishes/cans around the house.

They don’t take long showers, do makeup in the bathroom or do loads of laundry here.

They don’t leave their things around the house/store their personal stuff in communal areas.

Host is responsible for everything they do, they eat someone’s food/make a mess/break stuff host fixes/cleans/replaces.

These are the same rules I'd apply to anyone's new SO."
1024,cqgof2,"AITA for telling my friend that his friend is outting him? So my friend (Charlie) is gay, and he is not openly out although he is out to a pretty small circle of friends (including me). He is massively insecure about his sexuality and it brings him a lot of grief (saying he hates himself, outwardly flipflopping between expressing his attraction and disgust for men, trying to act “straight”). 

Many people have approached me and asked if he was gay, to which I would say I didn’t know. Recently my best friend said to me that Charlie was gay while I feigned ignorance and surprise. I asked how she knew and she said that Charlie’s friend had told her outright in the middle of a conversation. We moved on but I was surprised that Charlie’s friend would tell my friend that he was gay. My best friend said she was appalled by Charlie’s friend just abruptly bringing it up and thought it was disrespectful to Charlie to out him. To note: they are pretty close and Charlie seems to trust a lot. 

Yesterday me and Charlie were having another conversation about him being queer and how he didn’t like to think about people we know knowing he’s gay. I brought up his friend telling my best friend Charlie was gay and told him that he should be more careful who he tells. He told me that he never told my best friend that he was gay and didn’t intend on it. He was understandably shaken up and I tried to reassure him that no one cared he was gay, but he spiraled into another self hate session. 

The reason why I feel like I might be the asshole is bc I’m friends with Charlie’s friend and we are on very amicable terms. Also because Charlie was pretty upset and I don’t want to be the source of his further self hate. I don’t want to be known as the girl who throws others under the bus. 

But at the same time, as a queer girl myself, I wouldn’t want my friend to out me behind my back and not know that people I didn’t want to know knew of my sexuality. So let me know reddit, AITA?"
1025,bx73jn,"AITA for forgetting to throw out old wedding photos? My partner and I are in a long distance relationship at the moment and I'm currently sorting out a visa application. I asked him to look in an old box of documents to get some Home Office reference numbers off of letters that I might have kept. 

The box is a mess and is just a jumble of old bills and documents. What I didn't realize is that it had my old visa application in there, with pictures of me and my ex along with some cards. 

Now, my partner is livid. I said I'd delete everything having to do with my old marriage but this slipped through the cracks. I hadn't actually looked in the box in ages and it was such a mess, none of it was readily visible for me to even consider going through it.

Now my partner has called me ""fucking inconsiderate"", and is very upset with me, saying, ""they shouldn't fucking be in my house"". I tried to explain that I just forgot about them and he said ""I had to rifle through cards and photos of you two, and you bring that shit into our fucking house?"".

I've apologised sincerely twice, and I wasn't intentionally holding on to anything. I just have a box of documents I might need for visa applications and everything. I really didn't know anything was in there. I admit that I am messy and disorganized so I know it's my fault for just having a box of crap, but I don't know if I'm inconsiderate and an asshole. Am I?"
1026,chr0yk,"AITA for setting a passcode on my tablet About a week ago I set a passcode on my tablet because my little sister kept on getting into it and downloading weird games from the app store onto it, which I had to keep deleting everyday after I woke up. Sometimes I would oversleep because she was playing on it around the time my alarm went off and i wouldn't hear it. The other reason I locked it was because I get really anxious when people go through my gallery, reddit, etc., and my older brother and dad would look through my tablet sometimes and it made me feel like they were judging me for the things I have in the gallery and the things I post (my gallery is full of drawings I made.)

After I set a passcode, everyone got angry at me for doing it, so I told them the passcode. Later, I set another one and the next morning I woke up to my dad yelling at me about the passcode and he said he would sell the tablet. (It turns out he wasn't bluffing) About a day later my brother said he would show me where my dad hid the tablet if I told him the passcode and let him go through the tablet for a few minutes, so I let him do it. Nothing else has happened so far.

She isn't fluent, but knows enough to get by because of her parents. I thought it was cool at first because occasionally she'll teach me Russian. Sometimes, however, we'll hang out with my close friend who is fully Russian and fully fluent in the language and they'll randomly change the language of what they speak in our three person conversation. I'll start to feel left out since they usually speak in it for about  two minutes so I  change the subject so I can get involved. Now an hour later when my roommate is alone with me she's being passive aggressive and I think this is why?

1028,b2mr16,"AITA for not wanting to go out with a girl I previously was interested in. Throw Away because peeps know my account 

I used to be a scrawny dude and basically looked like Shaggy from Scooby Doo. 

So last year I went to a party. My friends encouraged me to talk to this girl. I've heard about her as we have a few mutual friends. ( let's call her Kaitlyn ) I saw her and let's just say I was interested.

I approached her and tried to talk to her and the conversation went like this.

Me:hey wh.. ( she interrupts me)

Kaitlyn: EW GROSS 

Me: what?

Kaitlyn: go away creep.

I think she began to shit talk me because people started giving me the stink eye and some big burly guy began threatening me so I decided to leave.

I would say six or so months ago I decided to change my a style bit I got a new haircut, new glasses and did some lifting. My friends say I look amazing and I agree. After the transformation there's people who still don't recognize me.

So yesterday I got a message on facebook from Kaitlyn she wanted to talk over coffee. I just ignore her. Later that day a mutual friend told me Kaitlyn really wants to go out on a date with me. I told my friend I didn't want to go out with Kaitlyn as I am no longer attracted to her. My friend told me that I'm obligated to at least go out on one date with her as I was previously attracted to her.

Kaitlyn messaged me and called me an asshole. A few of our mutual friends are calling me the asshole. Some of them are saying I'm obligated to at least go on a date with her. So AITA

1029,coawdo,"AITA for not washing my hair? Last night, I (f, 31) was cooking a dish that requires a lot of onions to taste right - I chopped about 3 onions. My boyfriend (m, 31) complains every time I cook onions because he says they make his eyes hurt. I offer to stop almost every time he complains, but he says he likes to eat them so I should still cook with them. I also rinse the onions before I cook with them because he tells me that helps minimize the sting although I have my doubts about whether that works.

I was slowly caramelizing the onions when about partway through, he started protesting that his eyes hurt and they were stinging. I was in the kitchen and he was in the living room, but it's an open concept space. At some point I went to hug him but he had to run away from my hug because he said my hair must be trapping the onion scent and the hair was pushing the scent into his eyes. 

The dish takes a long time and I was making a lot so we could have leftovers, so eventually he fled to the bedroom with the door closed because he said his eyes hurt so much and he couldn't take it anymore. I didn't tear up at all, by the way, not even when I was chopping them. Sometimes I'm affected, but not this time. 

I didn't finish until about two hours later, past eleven pm (I didn't cook as efficiently as I should have, so it took me way longer than I expected). Because I was exhausted, I showered and went to bed without washing my hair since I washed it the day before and I'm not a daily hair washer anyway. I was hoping that after so much time, the raw onion would no longer be in the kitchen air, in my hair, etc. But it wasn't the case, because after I got into bed my boyfriend said my hair was still making his eyes hurt and he was upset that I didn't wash it. 

I was very tired and sleepy and I had work the next day, so I didn't get out of bed to wash my evil hair and I just told him I was sorry but I was very tired after cooking so much. I went to sleep while he complained about his eyes. 

Now I'm thinking, should I have made myself wash my hair anyway, and AITA here?"
1030,adbagk,"AITA for telling my boyfriend he should be with another girl? Alright so I think this has asshole behavior on both sides but here it goes.

My bf is best friends with a girl, we will call her L. L and him play music together and he will hang out with her for hours and they get drunk and play music together, usually a couple of times a week. This is a relatively new friendship--a few months, they met working together. In the beginning I would get mad because he would get super drunk at her place and end up staying over - happened a few times a month. I know its not a cheating thing (really guys, it's not), but it still had my jealousy meter going. I am open minded and I have guy friends, and also very much value my autonomy, so as not to be hippocritical, I pretty much worked through these emotions to just get over it. For reference, I hadn't met her yet at this point.

We met around Halloween for the first time, and it was fine. Hung out a couple of times since then. I like her and I am glad they are doing something creative together. Apparently she suffers from anxiety (my bf does as well) and is somewhat intimidated by me.

Anyway so last night we were all hanging out together... And I weirdly felt like the third wheel. The majority of the night they were talking to each other, talking about inside jokes, that weren't relevant to me, not including me in the conversation, etc. I don't really blame her for it though, more him for not facilitating balance. After some drinks we were all walking back to our place and I told him ""you should just be with her"". 
Seeing how they were together, how she seems to have more patience for some of his no longer endearing antics (we've been together 3 years and his eccentricities can be obnoxious at times), and feeling left out the whole night revved up my jealousy and made me feel insecure. I obviously didn't mean it but it is what it is. Thinking about it now, I probably said it wanting reassurance.

He said or did something reassuring and it was a little better. Then we went to our place and they played music the rest of the night (drunkenly, not that great, repeating the same song over and over), which again was a 2 person thing.... Not including me at all.

So today he told me that what I said really upset him. I was pretty incredulous because I feel like i am the one who should be upset at him for third wheeling me all night. Not only that... But he TOLD HER what I said. So what could've been a conversation between my bf and I talking about how I shouldn't be jealous and how he should do a better job including me when we all hang, now has escalated, which will make it even less likely that L and I will have a decent relationship--it's just awkward now. 

So now he's mad at me and acting like all of this is my fault, when I see multiple areas that he screwed up. Sure i said something stupid but is it really that bad? 

TLDR: My bf has a good friend and band mate who is a girl. After all three of us hanging and drinking, I got jealous because they were third wheeling me all night (leaving me out of conversations/Inside jokes/playing music together instead of hanging the three of us) and I told him ""he should just be with her"". Now he's pissed I said that and it's getting blown up (he also told her what I said) , but I still think what he did was shitty, and that he is mostly in the wrong.

1031,bf2bg7,"AITA for moving someone's clothes? I live in an apartment building. It's a pretty low-class one, for reference. 

At the last building I was at, there were about 4 washing machines, to about 40 people. So realistically, you'd get your laundry done once every couple weeks, if you were lucky. If you're laundry was finished, and you weren't there to change it over, someone would just nicely put your clothes on top of a dryer. This meant that you would definitely get the dryer, but they could wash their clothes as well. 


Now I thought this was pretty respectful, and so when we moved in to the new apartment, I applied the same practice. 
This apartment has about 40 people, and two washing machines. It's a super shitty situation, I know. So today, I waited about five minutes for the person to come down and get their shit, before placing it nicely on top of the dryer that wasn't in use. 
They ended up coming in while I was leaving, and got super pissed off. I explained to them that it was what I was used to, and I apologized. I won't be doing it again, as upsetting anyone is obviously not my intention, but I'm finding it hard to understand why someone would get upset over this. It's not like I threw their shit on the floor, or just punted it onto another machine. 


Edit: I had no way of telling how long the clothes were sitting in the washer. When I came in, the cycle was over. If it had ended while I was in the room, I would have definitely waited longer.

As I am only 16 y/o, it’s difficult for me to find a job, so I was really excited. 
It was a 30 minute trip, and I had to give up babysitting in order for me to get to the meeting. Keep in mind that is like 30/40 bucks gone.
As I arrive at the restaurant, which by the way is very popular and well-known in my city, a staff member shows me this recruiter, and we start the meeting.
The meeting didn’t last very long, because the moment the guy saw I was 16y/o (I handed him my ID), he told me you had to be 17y/o to be even considered for the job. My resume has my birth date on it.
I was pissed, especially because he didn’t apologize once, and just told me I should return when I turn 17 (December).
I am back home now, and I am probably going to send him an angry message saying that he wasted my time, that he made me miss out on a lot of money and that his only job is to see if people check all the boxes for the job, which he clearly messed up.

1033,bhrxnu,"WIBTA if I got mad/upset over my SO letting a grieving friend take my place to something we had planned far in advance? I consider myself a nice person, but I feel so conflicted about both sides over this situation, where one makes sense, but I feel selfish, but the other seems rude, but thoughtful in a way.

So basically, there's this event that happens every year (won't say what, it doesn't matter) but it's a week long few states away, and costs a little bit to stay. I've always wanted to go for years. My SO has gone before and he promised to take me when we could afford it and have time off from work. So we both started saving up. Well, it's about a month away, but fortunately after a few years, we both have saved up enough to be able to go!

However... He recently found out that a friend's father has passed away due to serious illness, and the guy is taking it kind of hard. He was thinking about it, and had thought maybe going to the event would cheer him up since its about stuff he likes too. I wouldn't have minded if he tagged along, perhaps it would cheer him up! But instead of him ""tagging along"" my SO said he was just going to go with his friend.

As much as I want to be okay with it, I'm honestly crushed. Maybe I'm just being selfish, but I've waited so long for this. And my SO promised me years ago he would take me, and this was going to be the year. But now it's not and I might have to stay behind. And then wait a few more years, so my SO can save up again for us to go. The other guy can afford to go, so it's not like he'll be using my money. And due to rooming and transportation I can't exactly just go ""on my own.""

I feel really bad for my SO's friend, and I'm sure he could use some time with friends, but why does that mean that I have to forfeit one of my life dreams? I know I can go any other year, but again, I want to go with my SO and if they go, I have to wait for him to save again. 

Would I really be the asshole if I try to decline my SO giving up my spot..? Am I really the asshole because I don't want to give it up even though his friend is going through a hard time?

I've thought about suggesting they do something else, but I feel like if I am the asshole in this situation, then that won't be a good idea. And just to throw in, all my life I've really been a pushover, but lately I've been trying to not let others control what I do. But with that and the upsetting situation my SO's friend is in, it feels so conflicting. I feel like it would be different if my SO tried to discuss it with me,but instead he made it sound completely like ""he's going to take your spot, and thats kinda that.""

I might change schools though, because of this and that I can't get the language I basically *need* to have a life. I'm so fucking dissapointed by the school.

1039,b9lrh3,"WIBTA for campaigning fiercely to outcast someone from our social circle?  I'll call him Richard.

&#x200B;

This all began the summer before my junior year. My friends and I have been going into town after school on Friday since eighth grade, and over the summer we'd gang up if folks were in town. The summer before junior year, Richard, a mutual friend, was inducted into the group. He went to the other of two high schools in the district, but I didn't know him as well as others did.

&#x200B;

Richard was a fine addition at first. He was fun to be around the first couple of times. After a while, he started to annoy me. But other people were enjoying his presence so I wasn't going to make a big deal out of it. Richard quickly became ""one of the boys"" and I gradually became more and more annoyed by him. I found out towards the end of the summer that Richard was transferring to my high school. ~~Of course, I was thrilled.~~ I decided since my issues with Richard were mostly a personality clash, I would give him a shot, considering I'd see him on a near daily basis. That chance didn't last long.

&#x200B;

Richard has done the following:

* He sent in a group chat a photo of a halved cat, guts spilling out. We told him that wasn't cool. He sent the photo three more times.
* He screamed ""n\*\*\*\*"" out the window of his car while speeding down residential roads at \~60mph. Richard is white.
* He's been creepy-flirty with female friends, despite having a girlfriend.
   * This relationship won't last much longer. He detailed how he's gonna break her heart pretty soon. She's nice doesn't deserve it.
* He constantly talks about how privileged he is in the douchiest way possible, and regularly describes himself as an alpha male.
* While ill on a school trip, he shit in a hotel bed, but hid his pants behind a dresser, and left the mess for housekeeping to deal with.

&#x200B;

I lost my last straw a few Fridays ago when five friends (Richard included) and I went to a burger joint to eat. Richard was high out of his mind when we sat down. This is not uncommon for him. He probably drove there high too. He regularly called over our server, often when they were already helping someone else, for the most insignificant reasons. He ordered his food before the rest of us were ready because he couldn't wait 5 minutes. When he got his food, he deemed his bun to be insufficient for his burger and demanded a larger bun, even after we insisted to him that those were the only buns available. He audibly made fun of other customers, and took a picture of a man he thought looked like Walter White with his shutter sound on. I asked for the check as soon as possible because I wanted out of that situation. I don't think Richard tipped.

&#x200B;

1040,b85fu0,"WIBTA If I didn't allow anyone to post pictures of my child on social media? A preface – I am not a father, and nowhere near ready to be one yet. I'm in my early twenties with a lot to figure out. I posted on here recently about a narrow-minded mentality I have, and a lot of you all agreed that I was the asshole, which was true. So I do, definitely, have a long way to go before I'm ready to make that step.

Recently, I got into a very slight argument with my Mom about social media. I'm not a huge fan of Facebook or Instagram, and I honestly don't like having my own pictures posted on there, because I'm a relatively private person and just keep in touch with people through other means. My Mom is, in my opinion, far too eager to post pictures and updates about just about anything on social media, but I can set aside my own hang ups with it for the sake of being a part of this one thing that she really enjoys doing.

But I draw the line at my own child. I grew up right as social media was growing, and it wasn't a huge thing while I was really young, so I was able to have some agency over when I made my ""debut"" on the internet so to speak. I want to afford my own child the same privilege, and I don't want anyone posting photos of my kid before they're at least old enough to have a conversation about it and see if it's something they're into. When I told my parents this, they said I was being a little ridiculous, and that I should be eager to show the world my child whenever I have one. They might be right, and I might be being ridiculous, but would I be an \*asshole\* for asking friends and family to not post pictures on social media? I understand there isn't a whole lot of privacy in the modern age, but I want to afford my own children as much as I can give them while they grow to the point that they can make their own decisions on the matter.

There was a meeting held on the camp and what to prepare. Note that because I'm not baptized (nor do I want to), I wasn't allowed to participate in the meeting. No big deal, I just left and went to go on reddit on my phone.

I was told by my mother that the pastor paid for my slot on the retreat, and asked when I can get my stuff ready. I was blindsighted by this because I didn't give the pastor the go ahead to add me in. I was added in without my permission and someone made the decision to do it for me (I'm 18 as well, so it stings a bit how I apparently can't make my own decisions). The pastor cannot refund the money for the trip, so now I'm stuck (its this weekend).

So, would I be the asshole if I tell my pastor that I don't want to go on the trip? (I'm trying to see if I can pay him back for the money he used if I can). I was added in without my permission and this is a trip where I don't want to go and don't have the heart to participate in."
1043,d05b9g,"AITA for celebrating my son's birthday 2 days early?  So, myself and my Ex partner (whom I am generally on good terms with) have a son together, who will be 2 years old on saturday.

We  don't live together, she has him the majority of the time, and then I  either go and visit often around my work schedule/her fairly busy work  schedule and social life, or he comes over to mine to stay the odd night  etc when it suits him and both of us.

I  have just spent the day out with him today for our birthday celebration  as it is the last day I will see him before his actual birthday on  saturday, as she has booked to take him away to a seaside resort for the  weekend. She has asked me to cover the cost of the nursery bill for  that day which he would have attended had I not taken him out for the  day, as she had plans.

I thought  it would be nice to get him a few little cakes for after dinner and have  some candles lit and sing happy birthday as you do. When I say little, I  picked up 2 ""French Fancies""(a google search will reveal if you haven't  heard of them) and popped a candle in each, then took them to him after  dinner to sing happy birthday.

&#x200B;

Later  on, when I mentioned this to my ex, she flips out, saying: ""Why did you  do a cake with candles and everything when I've paid f\*cking 50 quid  (£) for a cake!? I'm not impressed""

I  was aware she was obviously going to do a big cake on his birthday  proper, but wasn't aware of how much she spent on the cake (i feel it is  pretty irellivant to him, he's 2). I explained to her that I just  wanted to do a little something and that I deliberately didn't want to  make a big deal of it.

She then comes back with ""You sang happy birthday when it's not his birthday till saturday and now ruined it for saturday""

Am I the asshole here?"
1044,eq0069,"AITA for asking my boyfriend's boss to take away his keys at an employee event? So my boyfriend and I work together, and yesterday, we had a work dinner. My boyfriend was absolutely plastered and I wouldn't be surprised if he did drugs too. When it was time to leave, he took out his keys and told me to come. I said I wouldn't get in his car if he was driving like that, that I'd call a cab, hoping it would make him hop in it too, but no, he was really set on driving.

So I went to our boss and told her about the situation. She confronted him, took his keys, and drove us home. When we got home, he yelled at me, called me names and just everything in the book saying I humiliated him in front of his superiors and that I should've just kept my stupid mouth shut.

I just wanted him to be safe, but at the same time I do feel kinda bad involving my boss in this. Could've been better if i had just tried to deal with it just the two of us. So reddit, AITA?"

She has her own studio set up in her basement and has tons of clients every week. She usually cuts my hair and does it for free whenever I ask-which I am very grateful for...however, she hesitated to do any major change to my hair when I ask and most of the times she just treats my hair as her personal project of sorts. I have been to her before and shown her a color and asked her to dye my hair and she will try to talk me out of it or recommend something else every single time. Like it seems like she’s disappointed that I want to dye my hair. I really want to dye my naturally blonde hair an auburn red color. I have been talking about it for years. She also has previously done other things to my hair without asking me like giving me tons of layers around my face when I asked for no layers (I wear my hair up a lot). I was devastated I have baby hairs flying everywhere now! I tried to tell her about it and she just says “oh no it’s ok! It looks good! Trust me”I want to go to a different salon because I know there will be no family related conversation and the hairdresser there would give me exactly what I ask for. But I’m worried I might hurt her feelings or she might be offended....AITA??

1047,ba52pk,"AITA for ghosting a guy after the first date Sorry for spelling and formatting I'm on my phone and long post . (18F)

I met this guy online and he seemed alright and after a recent break up I was ready to try something new. I met him and right away I know it wasn't going anywhere, he looked very much different from his pictures and within a few moments of meeting he wanted to hug which I was very clear made me uncomfortable.

The date was filled with uncomfortable silence and I tried very hard to make conversation but he just wouldn't talk at least not much. When he did it was about anime or sexual stuff which I shrugged off and ignored. I made an excuse to leave early at which he asked if he could come back to mine because my mum wasn't in (I had said she had work and that's why I had to go home, she didn't have work).

I told him no but he kept asking until we got to where we had to part he asked me again I told him very clearly no. Then he asked for a hug and a kiss, I gave him a very quick and uncomfortable side hug but refused him the kiss then hurried off.

Within minutes of of us parting he messaged and asked if I had fun made another sex joke and when the next date was, I just said I was busy and I didn't know. He kept messaging me, with me not answering anything because I suffered really bad social anxiety and couldn't bring myself to tell him I didn't like him and he made me feel very uncomfortable, so I just blocked him without saying anything.

Today i told a friend of mine that I just blocked him and he said I should have been clear about why I was blocking him. I really don't think I could have because of my anxiety but now I feel really bad about it, so am I the asshole for just blocking and not explaining why to him.

I'd like to say thank you so much to everyone you commented I feel better now and I beleve I made the right decision for me. 🙂"
1048,etbogh,"AITA for not inviting my friend/housemate to my best friends surprise dinner? So I’ve (22F)  lived with, let’s call her Abby (22F), for about 2 and a half years now (we are at uni together) as well as living with my best friend and some other girls/guys in our friendship group. Now in first year my best friend (Polly) didn’t overly get on with Abby due to just difference in personalities. However during second year we all became closer. 

For some context Abby is never on time, we say 9 and she’s ready at 10, We text her and won’t hear back for 1-2 weeks despite her being glued to her phone. She left another friend in Manchester for an hour after they agreed to meet (just the 2 of them)

Now for the last few months since 3rd year started (September) we haven’t seen her I would say in total I’ve seen her for about two and a half weeks. This is since about July if you include summer holidays. 

Now polly’s birthday is coming up in a week and we’ve spoken about going for a meal, I questioned whether Abby would be invited? We weren’t even sure if she would be here. Polly said that as she hasn’t seen Abby nor does Abby ever text or ask about polly, she said if she’s back yes but she isn’t overly keen as she doesn’t really consider them friends. 

So Abby is now back from home after missing the first two weeks, and ask our friend what we are doing for Polly’s birthday- me and Pollys mum have arranged a meal and that the mum is going to pay for. So would I be the AH for not inviting Abby as has given no interest in Polly or her life for the last half a year- so its unfair for pollys mum to pay for someone who literally takes no interest in her 

(If it isn’t clear its awkward that everyone who is invited lives in our house plus 2 others, so Abby would be the only one in the house not invited)"
1049,b40l1o,"AITA for refusing to go to a party when I was only invited if I ""don't cause any problems""? So in my group of friends, there is a guy who isn't really my friend but hangs out with my friends. I make it a point to kind of avoid talking to him because he is usually pretty rude to me. He thinks that its a joke to call me a slut or say I have no standards, but its not really a joke when you say it to someone who already doesn't like you.

I have told him to stop.

My friends have told him to stop.

He doesn't. 

So anyway, a friend of mine who just joined our group invited me to her birthday, and I was pretty happy about it until my girlfriend texted me that the girl throwing the party had texted her about me. So I asked what it was about, and my GF said that this girl wanted to make sure I wasn't going to start any problems. This confused my GF so she asked what she meant by that. Apparently the girl said that i always get so butthurt when the guy mentioned above jokingly insults me. My girlfriend knows she hasn't been around our group long enough to know that he always does that kind of stuff to me, and we have a long history of him ""jokingly"" hitting and sexually harassing me, so she tries to explain the situation, but this girl doesn't care and just wants my promise not to start anything. So me and my girlfriend get pissed and just say fuck it because she didn't even deliver a similar text to the guy. I'm definitely not going.

1050,cb4eu4,"AITA for shutting friend out of my account? Several months ago I let my friend use my PS4 account to share digitally downloaded games with him, because there was one which I particularly wanted someone to play with me on, and as he also wanted to try the game it seemed like a logical idea to give him access to my account and to let him download the game and play it by setting my account to the primary one on his PS4. I had a lot of fun with him on it and I was fine with him having access to my bank details as I trust him, and know he would not use them. However, as time went on and I bought the odd game here and there on the PSN store, I would find he had also downloaded the games using my account too. I'll be honest I didn't mind at first as it seemed logical if we could both get the game without buying it twice, but I wasn't expecting or wasn't offered any money for the fact I was bearing the weight of a game purchase, and someone else was getting free access to it. We have a friend group who play Black Ops 4 together and at the time of release I purchased the digital deluxe 

EDIT: It's not a matter of money to me at all, I've certainly got my money's worth from the game. I was more concerned about the fact I wasn't asked in advance about downloading any games beyond the initial one I offered to share, and that I had never been offered to do an account swap or something like that so I could access some of his games in return. I just didn't want to leave him in a position wherein we are all on playing now and he is unable to join us without paying money immediately to do so, which may not be financially possible for him right now."
1051,ad6qd8,"AITA turning her into the IRS Hey all so when I was in high school I got with my now ex husband and his mom was horrible to me. 

From day one she knew I could never be good enough for her baby boy and actually cried when she found out we were getting married and begged my ex not to do it, that “if  he loved his mother he wouldn’t” we ended up getting married anyway and she made my world a living nightmare. 

Back to when we first met though, she worked for this millionaire lady taking care of her mentally disabled son.  The deal was my ex’s mom would take care of the son and the millionaire would pay her cash so she didn’t have to put it on her taxes. 

My ex’s mom stole SO MUCH money from us over the years we were together in multiple ways. 

1 when he turned 18 he got a $17,000 settlement from the government (something to do with his father it’s a long story) and she took every penny of it. 

HERES where it starts effecting me 

We got married when we were 20 (dumb I know but that’s not what this is about ) as soon as tax season rolls around I start getting phone calls from his mother 

The calls were essentially this “I’m going to claim my son on taxes this year so you better not filed as married filing together or ill x,y,z” 

Now it’s my understanding that when your 20, married, and not living under your parents roof you can’t be claimed by them? But that’s exactly what she did.  This crazy ass woman claimed my ex husband on taxes so that she could get more money.

Did she care that it effected our finances or my college at all? Nope I was just the fat bitch married to her son 

The entire time I was married to mommies boy mom was first and if I did anything to hurt mommy I was the bad guy. When he told her we were getting married and she cried he told me that if not for me he would take it back because mommy was upset. 

I want to report her to the IRS

Anyways, the villain for this season is this guy called Oswald Mosley. For those of you who don't know who he is (I didn't before watching either), he's a British politician who started the 'British Union of Fascists'. 

In the season finale, he wears an outfit that I really loved: black turtleneck sweater, black pants, black shoes. He also dressed like that irl. I just loved the aesthetic and decided to copy it for this semi-formal party I had yesterday night. My sistee noticed I was dressing different than usual and asked about it. She apparently knew who Mosley was and got mad at me, saying I shouldn't copy a fascist's sense of style.

I think she was overreacting here, since it's literally a turtleneck that I saw a guy wear on TV. But she thinks because it's inspired by a fascist, it's automatically wrong.

1053,dmras9,"AITA for not accepting my stepmom's Facebook friend request? A bit of background first. My parents split up when I was 11 and my dad really quickly got together with this woman, who we'll call Susanne.

I never got along with Susanne, and she didn't make much of an effort with me. She belittled my hobbies and intelligence, called me derogatory words relating to my effeminacy, and is generally quite racist and bigoted. I don't want to go into things too much and appreciate this is only my side of the story, but we never got on that well. I mostly just ignored whatever came out of her mouth, I never baited her or argued back. 

The worst instances were when she lost her temper - she'd just break stuff and storm out for hours at a time. Once she left the rest of us (dad, sister, me) in an unfamiliar town because she didn't like where we wanted to go for lunch. We had no way of contacting her because she took the car and didn't have her phone on her. Because of her homophobia and anger issues, I've never come out to her or my dad (dad is like a sieve when it comes to information, everything I tell him he tells her). 

Since I left home about ten years ago I haven't been back much because of her. At first I went back to see my dad, who I don't want to punish because of his association with her, but she was still just very unpleasant and the visits were never enjoyable for me because of that. I still go back every now and then but not often.

Susanne and I used to be friends on Facebook. A few months ago Susanne posted something that really offended me - a homophobic rant just after an LGBT person was killed in our state for their sexuality. I unfollowed her, not wanting to cause any drama.

She must have found out, or something happened, because she blocked me on Facebook. I found out when I searched for her profile a few months ago and couldn't find it. I didn't really care. I think when you unblock someone then you're no longer friends with them because we weren't connected on FB after that. 

About a month ago, Margaret noticed that Susanne and I arent friends on Facebook anymore, asked me about it (I said I didn't know why) and must have told our dad. Susanne sent me a friend request, which I've ignored. Dad hasn't mentioned anything to me about it and I doubt he will, he's a head in the sand type of person who hates conflict. 

Here's my question: AITA for not just sucking it up and accepting the request? My sister's wedding is in a couple of weeks and I can imagine Susanne starting some drama about it.

TL;DR: stepmonster is a dick and a bigot but am I being a bigger dick by ignoring her pending friend request."
1054,adi5fv,"AITA for not inviting my brothers not girlfriend to my birthday? I've invited a bunch of my friends and my brother out and said they're welcome to bring their partners.

&#x200B;

Immediately after sending the invites I receive a text from my brother asking if I'll invite Betsy.

&#x200B;

This is a rerun of a conversation we had last year, where I essentially said no, I won't invite her. He kept asking and I held my ground. They're not technically dating, despite him clearly being crazy over her. He's over there most evenings but this has now been going on for years and they'll briefly date then break up because they're a terrible couple.

&#x200B;

My reasons for not wanting her there are multiple, we'll start with those not relating directly to my brother:

\- She propositioned one my brother's best mates (who I'm also friends with, we'll call her Flange) boyfriends on a night out. Flange was on holiday, so she'd never know was her argument. The boyfriend turned her down and told Flange. Betsy has given me two different stories on this and has reason to lie, so I believe the boyfriend who is a decent guy and adores Flange.

\- She slept with (another) one of my brothers other best friends (again, who I'm friends with) while she had a boyfriend with whom she has two kids with.

&#x200B;

These are all things that happened before my brother knew her, in fact he started talking to her just after she propositioned his best friends mate. His judgement is not sound. 

&#x200B;

My brother loves to white knight, and she's a single mother with a severely disabled child, so she's essentially his wet dream. To her credit, she's a really good mum and the dad is barely present when it comes to the disabled kid.

&#x200B;

I gave her a chance when they started hanging out and briefly dating. She's a prime example to me of someone who is fun enough to be around but has a terrible character.

&#x200B;

I inadvertently managed to break them up 18 months ago when, on a night out she was telling me how I should be more like my brother with dating and I, somewhat drunkenly (and I AITA here) replied ""I'm not planning accidentally knock up an 18 year old"". She apparently didn't realise how old my nephews mother had been when they were together, she freaked out at him and broke up. A few days later my brother, devastated, asks me to talk to her. I do, and her response is basically that he's a child molester (to clarify, he is not and all was above board). I am frankly done with her at this point. If that's what she thinks of him having known him then she's not worth my time.

&#x200B;

Anyway, they patch things up because she gets lonely and wants company a week or so later but are ""just friends"". He at her beck and call. He still chases her, she still leads him on, letting him think they'll be together, a month ago I was told by a third party he had a girlfriend. When I asked him if they were dating again it was ""not official yet"". It still isn't and her Facebook profile repeatedly states she's single.

&#x200B;

She's said previously, by my brothers own admission she doesn't love him and likes him because he buys her things. None of his friends like her but they tolerate it and don't tell him what they really think. 

&#x200B;

I don't want to encourage this, or have Betsy there on my birthday. I've said partners are welcome and if she's his partner then she counts too, but I don't want her there and I won't extend a personal invite. AITA?

I've been dating Kira for 2 months now.  I get home late sometimes, so on nights where she comes over and I wont be home til late it makes sense for her to just pick up food.  Most times I'm not home late so we go out together, or we cook something, but 3 times now I just cash app her $20 and she picks up some fast food because its too late to do that stuff.

The first time we did this, she told me where she wanted to pick up food, so I texted her what I wanted from there, then sent her $20.  My order was only $7 so I definitely gave her enough to cover whatever she wanted as well.  She can keep the change, buy herself a coffee in the morning on me...or whatever else.  She came home with the wrong order for me.  It was still something I liked (I ordered a burger, she brought home a chicken sandwich) so it wasn't a big deal.  She said they must have messed up the order.  She definitely told them a burger.  OK, no problem, shit happens.

Few weeks later, same shit.  This time a different fast food restaurant.  I texted her my order, sent her more than enough money to buy both of our food, and she came home with the wrong order for me.  Except this time, I don't like the food I was given.  Its not something I order from this restaurant.  I don't like the wet burrito platos from Del Taco, and she got me the chicken verde wet burrito plato.  I don't like green sauce, either.  I asked for a epic cali steak n guac.  Its a completely different type of burrito.  I said what the hell?  You're 0 for 2 on the take out orders, are you doing this on purpose?  She insists it was a lapse in judgement.  I ordered a burrito, and they have a new(ish) chicken verde burrito, so she thought I might like to try it.  I assured her I don't wanna try any new burritos.  Please just get what I ask for, or else whats the point in me even asking?  She told me she would.

Now tonight, SAME SHIT.  Back at Del Taco, I order another epic cali steak n guac, this time she brings back a carne asada wet burrito plato.  Now I'm mad.  I had a rough day and I was looking forward to my burrito.  I DONT LIKE WET BURRITOS.  When I saw that on the table, I laughed.  I thought she was joking.  OK, jokes over, wheres my real burrito?  It was no joke.  She thought I didn't like the other one just because of the green sauce, so she got me one with red sauce.

Thats fucked.  I picked up the dish and threw it in the trash.  I told her if I cant trust her to get a basic ass food order right I don't know how I trust her as a SO in a relationship, then I left and got my burrito.  She's still in bed crying.  I'm going to go in and talk to her in a bit, but I'm still too frustrated.  Honestly.  Why would you keep buying someone the wrong thing? This is on purpose, right?

1059,ee4xgg,"AITA for considering to tell my BIL (husbands bro) and his wife not to come or bring their child to Christmas Dinner if they are sick? We are hosting Christmas dinner on Wednesday and last night, my husbands aunt had a viewing of a Christmas movie for the kiddos (all toddlers) at her house. Initially, his brother and the girlfriend (whom I don’t get along with anyway) declined this invite because they had plans to attend another party. The other kids coming to this event weren’t going to be in attendance at our Christmas party so we all brought presents to exchange in lieu of that.

My MIL who had planned to come anyway called my husband en route (an hour commute) and said she had our niece with her, because they were all sick and couldn’t go to their initial party they had planned to go to (they have a baby as well) so I guess the next best thing was to send their sick 4 year old daughter with my MIL (to spread the germs). On top of that, no one brought her present with them.

My daughter (just turned 3) has a small surgery coming up on January 6 and we were advised we cannot give her any type of medications for two weeks up until. She attends daycare so that’s playing roulette as it is with illnesses anyway. Christmas is 3 days away and I can’t assume this family will feel any better and am considering asking them to stay put if they are still sick - especially the little girl as she would be the only other kid coming and there would be shared toys, typical coughing and sneezing in the face, etc. We already have a rocky relationship as it is and BIL already claimed that the GF planned to leave early as she doesn’t want her BABY exposed to any illnesses as she was recovering from one (which is likely why the rest of them are sick)."
1060,cunqe9,"AITA for not wanting to talk to my best friend because I’m upset? Context: I graduated high school 2 years ago, and as we do with different work and study schedules, I don’t see my friends too often. My best friend, let’s call her Anne, and my close friend Bri and I were always the trio and try to hang at least once a month. (Anne, Bri and I have been friends since 2013.)

Things started to get busier and of course, I understand and don’t mind that at all. However, Anne has a friend, let’s call her Claire, that also went to our school. Anne and Claire went out for lunch and invited Bri while I was at home not doing much. I asked her about it and she said it was a last minute thing after uni, and she didn’t even think to ask me. I was a little hurt but if that really was the answer, I brushed it off.

Fast forward a couple months and Anne, Bri and Claire are out at lunch again (seen via snapchat) while I’m again, at home not doing much. I message A asking about it again and she replies “damn, caught.”
I explain how that reply upset me and not being invited out when we don’t see each other much hurts me, in which she replied ”I’m sorry but you’re really making this about yourself, we went out to celebrate uni exams being over.” This only confused me more since Bri doesn’t study and yet she was invited, the restaurant they went to was down the road from me and I am more than capable of making my way over had they asked. I would have loved to celebrate her success too! I just didn’t know it was happening.

She backpeddled in her messages and blamed it on Claire organising it, then said Claire was driving. (like I said, I can get there, and I explained that to her.) When I contacted Bri about it and she apologised and said she knew I was free Thursdays that was on her, though she was just invited along to this. After Anne apologised by saying “I’m sorry but you’re really attacking me, and I don’t know what you want from me” Even after I had explained I would just like some responsibility to be taken, is all. I sent a concluding message to say we mustn’t be on the same page as I had thought, and that’s okay, but I just would rather be made aware of that instead of being lied to.

It’s been 2 months since then, and both Bri and I don’t reach out to Anne anymore, (Bri got cut off by Anne too, we both don’t know why) but I was just reflecting on it. Thanks for the comments guys.

AITA for being upset with her over a lunch?

1061,avv88x,WIBTA If I burn my friend's minecraft house down? My friend burnt my house down in minecraft and burnt all my valuable items and blamed it on some random person. I got in touch with that person and it turns out he DIDN'T burn my house down. I confronted my friend telling him I know he was the one who burnt my house down and he's like so what? what are you gonna do about it? it's just minecraft get over it! I know it's minecraft but I put REAL LIFE TIME into that stuff and so I asked him how would you feel if burnt down your house and your valuables? He said he wouldn't care he'd just rebuild his house and get new stuff. I was so angry! SO BASICALLY my friend burns down my house and resets all my hard work and to save his ass he blames it on this poor kid for what!? just cause he felt like causing me trouble?! Would I really be the asshole if I give him a taste of his own medicine? 
1062,8ml9pk,"Aita parking app AITA 
I used an app to rent someone's driveway for the day and paid upfront.
I reserved the space From early morning until late at night as I was in town working..
When I got to the driveway around midday there was another car blocking the drive/Using the space.
I was in a rush as I had to get on a train and didn't want to leave my car in the main road while I knocked on the owners door (They may not have been in) and got them to move so I ended up parked in another free space around the corner.
The app says to speak to owners before leaving feedback.
So I asked if I can have a refund as I didn't use the space... as I had reserved it but it was taken during the hours id reserved.
They said no so I left negative feedback."
1063,emc0rk,"AITA for shouting at a strangers child? Hear me out.   

I (21F) am in my final year in college, so my grades really matter to me at this point. I was finishing off the last bits of my assignment at the library and there was a child (5?M) more or less bouncing off the walls. He was running around to each table staring at people, talking to them, singing and ultimately really distracting me never mind everyone else. His mom was just chilling on her phone. When the child came to me I told him nicely that I’m doing work and need to focus.   

Well this intrigued him clearly because he wouldn’t leave me alone! 10 minutes in I asked her to tell him to be quiet and she barely made an attempt to, she called his name and was like “____ be quiet” and he was for a minute. I asked again and she told me it’s a public area. I mean like yeah but it’s intended for being quiet? I’m not a baby sitting facility.  

I was getting really impatient and she went back onto her phone, her child asks me if I want to play a game. I lost my shit and shout something along the lines of “Ask your mom if she wants to play games I’m very clearly busy, leave me alone”. The mom got soooo mad and shouted at me for giving out to her child and told me it’s her job as a parent to discipline her child not me but I told her she wasn’t she was being a lazy fuck and expecting everyone else to keep an eye on her child. The child starts crying and she starts calling me names and I just told her to fuck off and mind her kid.   

They left the library and people were staring at me after.   

AITA?

Edit: I genuinely did NOT expect this to get the attention it did!! Mixed results but ultimately agree that I should’ve just gotten library staff involved. I don’t usually have that bad of a temper, I think I’m just stressed (not that it excuses it at ALL). Thank you for your input everyone!!"

1066,ba2ulk,"AITA for not wanting to help my struggling ex and feeling satisfied that she is struggling? I dated this girl for a few years in college, she was my first real serious girlfriend. We got along great, lived together, and even talked about getting married after we were able to get our respective careers established.

That is until my best friend confessed to me that he and my girlfriend had slept together while drunk and she was attempting to make it a fwb thing with him. I confronted her and she told me she loved me and did want to marry eventually but she wanted an open relationship until after college. I told her I didn't want that and that she should have gone about all of that in a different way and I moved out.

So in one fell swoop I lost a relationship with my girlfriend and my best friend and a place to live.

What followed was several years of poor decisions - drug use, promiscuity, generally abused my body. 22 y.o. me blamed my ex and ex best friend for my tailspin. After a few years of that I was able to recover and get back on the right track. I made myself take full credit for my poor life choices and forgave the people that hurt me. I still didn't have contact with them but I resolved the feelings of hatred I had for them and forgave them.

I don't use social media so I'm sort of insulated from knowing what goes on in the lives of the people I don't associate with regularly and I hadn't heard anything about my ex or ex best friend for many years and had honestly put them out of my mind.

All was well until I ran into a friend of mine from college and he told me my ex was struggling. She had recently been arrested for OUI (driving drunk) with her small children in the vehicle and she lost her professional license (she works in a medical field). She is having a really hard time, her marriage is on the rocks, and she basically lost her career.

For some reason being presented with this information has dredged up all sorts of feelings I thought I had dealt with and put behind me already.

1) AITA for feeling like this is karma and what she deserves. Obviously I did not and will not be making these feelings known to anyone but this is how I feel about it internally.

2) AITA for not helping her in some way. Without going into detail there are things I could do to help her pull herself out of this rut but I really don't feel like she deserves my assistance.

Really struggling with this and feeling pretty guilty as I've never wished ill on anyone before."
1067,b6e7hy,"AITA For continuing to report my neighbor to my apartment's front office Background: I live in an apartment complex with my husband and two dogs. The complex is pet friendly, which means a ton of dogs. Leash law is in the surrounding area outside the property as well as mandatory in the complex. 
Last August someone moved down the hall from us with a lab puppy. No biggie, it was a small puppy and they had it off leash every now and then. He was just a little chonk so no harm, I suppose. 

However, now he is almost a fully grown dog and I'd guess around 80 pounds. It's pretty much daily that he's off leash and running around the apartment with my neighbor. My neighbor relies on an electric collar to make his dog behave, which works only after he's repeatedly called him and shocked him multiple times.

To avoid problems, I try to time when I go out with my dogs bc I don't want to be caught on the stairs/in the hallway at the same time with mine and his dog, but we've had run-ins before where I quickly have to duck away with mine.
 I'm not going to act like my dogs are perfect, one is reactive but I'm working on him. The other is pretty okay with other dogs as long as they don't invade her space. Even so, they are always on leash so I can control them, unlike my neighbor who relies on his dog listening to him and his collar.

I contacted the front office (last October) about this happening and they told me to take a picture of them and email it. At this point, I've emailed them over a dozen times and I believe they have fined him once but it hasn't changed this problem.

Tonight we had a run-in and his dog was very close to mine. He finally got his dog away after shocking it a few times. I hadn't said anything to him until this point about it, but I spoke up and said ""Hey, he's a pretty big dog, he probably needs a leash.""
He was pretty dismissive, ""Oh he's fine, he's just training.""

I have already reported him this week so I'm not sure if the office is already planning on doing something, but am I an asshole for continuing to report him?"
1068,eivfee,"AITA for making my mum take the kids to the pool after she unilaterally got them excited about a trip to the pool? I celebrated my six year old’s birthday with my parents today. We had a fairly involved morning, and in the afternoon I was watching television while my six year old quietly played with her younger sister.

Without consulting me, my mother suddenly said “get your swimmers on girls, daddy is going to take you swimming!”. My kids excitedly ran to get their swimmers. Obviously until that moment we hadn’t planned to take them swimming.

I said to Mum “well, I guess you’re taking them swimming then.” I don’t appreciate it when someone else decides my schedule for me, especially if they raise the stakes by getting my kids excited first.

Anyway I thought this was a reasonable position. I couldn’t imagine going up to someone else’s kids and unilaterally declaring “guess what, your mum’s taking you to the zoo/circus/pool/whatever. However, my family has reacted negatively. My father said “I can’t believe you won’t take them swimming.” My brother said “you weren’t doing anything anyway, and it’s her birthday”. My mum complained at length at having to take them swimming.

Now to be clear, everyone involved would agree I am generally a devoted and involved father. And if my mum for some reason hadn’t followed through, I’d have taken them to make sure they weren’t disappointed. This isn’t a “let’s force deadbeat dad to spend time with kids” issue.

So I’m double checking with you reddit. Am I the arsehole?

Edit: sorry all. With the responses this reads like an affirmation-seeking post. Honestly when everyone around you is speaking differently you start to question your opinion, however reasonable you originally thought it was."
1069,di0jao,"AITA for wanting to meet my boyfriends family before getting officially engaged? So, here's the backstory to it.

I've been with my bf for almost 4 years now. In all this time together we have bonded really well together. We get along amazing and I would truly describe him as the perfect man. If there wasn't this only subject bothering me so much. His family.

And what bothers me about it is the fact that I don't know them. It's not like they live really far away and we can't meet. We literally live in the same city. Big city. Yes. But doesn't make it impossible to work it out.

He comes from a big family, he is the 5th of 7 siblings. So most of them are already married and have children.

His mom passed away when we were 2 years into our relationship. He didn't bother to tell me (I know it's his mom and he doesn't have to tell me immediately) but  I literally found out 3 days after when a friend that's not even close to none of us (or even to his family) texted me asking why I wasn't at the funeral when they were there (they told me the day of). I immediately texted my bf asking if he was ok and if he would like me to stop by to support him, to which he responded saying he didn't want me there but instead he would prefer to take me out for dinner (we went out while they were cremating his mother). We ate, talked about it, he cried and I gave him all the support I could before he left to go home. 
I have asked him several times why he didn't tell me about his mom, he basically called me selfish about wanting to make his mom dying into something about me (I didn't, i just asked why he didn't tell me about it and had to figure it out from someone else)

Also, it's not that he has a bad relationship with them. Sometimes he'll talk about them and his nephews. Even when we chat and he is with them he might send pics of the kids doing funny stuff.

I'm the other side, he has already met my parents and they love him, so do my siblings. He has even stayed with us at my parents home. (In a different room of course, because my parents are really old fashioned and traditional)

When he comes over and stays at my parents he tells his family he is going somewhere else rather than telling them we are together. He has even said his father thinks he is gay for not having a girlfriend. Because yeah, no one in his family knows we've been dating for over 4 years. Once we casually encountered one of his cousins and he introduced me as a friend. 

After all this time together, we have started talking about moving in together, getting engaged, getting married and even having children. He has been open with me telling me he is already looking for a ring and asking for my size. Whenever he chooses to propose I want it to be surprise, but I already know that will happen.

However, knowing about it and thinking about planning a wedding, I honestly don't feel comfortable with inviting people that I barely know their names. Because yeah, we already kind of talked about it and it seems I won't meet his family until the literal day of my wedding.

Weddings are supposed to be to share with your loved ones. But how can you share something with someone you don't even know?

AITA for wanting to meet them prior to our wedding? Or am I just being paranoid about it since it really makes me upset he doesn't want to introduce me to them.

Update: 
No, we aren't different races and this is not a gay/lesbian relationship, so it's not like he is coming out to his family or so.

Also, we are both catholic and he even got baptism so we could have a church wedding, but I didn't attend it because he also didn't want me there.

AND no, this is not a second relationship, he hasn't been married before and of course is not divorced.

Yes, I've tried to discuss with him about meeting his family but he just keeps avoiding it. Once he said it was better me not knowing them and to be honest, that really hurt my feelings.

Also, this is something that only happens with his family, everyone from both our jobs (we work in different companies) and both mine and his friends know we have been together since the beginning.

Also since the beginning of our relationship he asked me to not post pictures of us together since he didn't want people talking about us. Which I kind of understand since I don't like of having my personal life being talked about (yes, I know I came here to talk about it but it's because I really need outsiders advice)

And this really doesn't mean there are no pictures of us together, just, sometimes he'll have it as a profile picture for a couple days and then erase it. And yeah, if you look closely in social media it's more than obvious we are a couple. You can see that in some posts or comments we do towards each other.

For those saying that i should just show up at his family's house and introuce myself, since i do not know them i don.'t want to look like the crazy girlfriend showing off of nowhere.

And no, the kids are his nephews, I've seen pictures of their baptism's and it clearly shows how they are the children of his siblings."
1070,c6hz3m,"WIBTA if I stopped hanging out with my boyfriend's friend circle? Me (19m) with my boyfriend (20m). We've been together for almost a year. He's amazing but he has the most annoying, shallow friends. They're all art school students who believe they're better than everyone else. Oftentimes they act like high school bullies and gossip behind one another's backs, which is immature and disgusting imo. Also hypocritical, given that most of them are also LGBT and have been bullied at some point.

For instance, they call every gay guy a f*g regardless of whether he's comfortable with that or not. They used to do that with me too until my boyfriend called them out, though I'm sure they're still doing it behind our backs. Why? Because they can't go a second without gossipping. The other day, I had to call out a dude in our WhatsApp group for revealing deeply personal information about a classmate of his (that he's a virgin), shared with him in confidence. Just to score easy points and start drama.

Given this, would I be the asshole if I broke off contact with my boyfriend's pals? He does hang out with my friends, so I don't know if that'd be hypocritical. Tbh he also admits they can be annoying, but he doesn't want to distance himself since they're his only close friends."
1071,b93we3,"WIBTA if I kicked a player out of a 5e campaign before it started due to his character? I've been trying to run a campaign with a group of friends I've known for a few years and one of them kept making joke characters because he is, in his own words, a ""noob"".

These characters included the ""piss lord"" half-elf, the unbelievably illiterate dragonborn, and the upcoming orc named Kerhs Eht Ergo(Shrek The Ogre). 

I'm getting tired of this and have tried to confront him about that stated above along with his increasingly bad behaviour at the table. He finds it funny and breaks well established house rules, taking 1d4 damage when derailing everything for more than a few minutes, but the others enjoy him being there and I don't want to upset them.

Other incidents that occur with him typically involve having anyone with the Entertainer background joke incessantly about them being prostitutes, him saying he'd be a better DM without anything to back up this claim, and the player in question throwing his weight around because he owns the discord server we all use for convenience.

I've acted like an asshole a few times when chewing him out and he knows how I feel about this. Even if he does play, I've warned him and every other player about the new material I'm planning on using. It's Tomb Of Annihilation, and I've told everyone that ""at least one person might die, maybe"" in order to get across how dangerous everything will be in the campaign."
1072,dh4eyh,"AITA for telling my partners mother she needs to leave My partners mother is a teacher who travels to different countries for teaching gigs to ‘see the world’. After finishing a year of teaching in Egypt, she was offered a job in China, and decided to take it. My partner and I agreed to have her stay with us in our spare room until she had gained the appropriate visa/paperwork for her to be legally allowed to work in China. Thinking this would only take maybe a maximum of two-three weeks (perhaps I was ignorant to how long such processing takes, however I believe this was a reasonable assumption considering she already had a secured job, living situation ect) we took her in with no offer from her to contribute towards rent, electricity or whatnot — which was ok, because it was only going to be a short while right? Wrong. 
After about 3 months passed (all the while not contributing towards rent or any other expenses) she had finally applied for and secured her work visa in China, and booked her flights. At this point I was just happy we were going to have our house back and we offered to take her to the airport for her flight. However, only a few hours before her flight was due to leave, she decided she was no longer going to go and would be staying with us until she could get a job in our city. 
1 week later, after tense arguments between my partner and I, I have told him that I’m not willing to have her stay with us any longer. We have already gone out of our way to accomodate her without expecting anything in return, and now she expects us to continue to do so without any idea of how quickly or even if she will get another job. 
My partner thinks I am the asshole for my unwillingness to have her stay. She’s family after all. But considering we were only expecting a few week’s, she needs to start paying or find somewhere else."

1074,eca2yi,"AITA For telling my parents I told you so? This happened not long ago and my stepmom is still pissed at me. We just arrived in Japan for a small vacation and we were waiting in separate line for custom. There was a sign in front that says to go through one by one so I thought that even if you have family members, you do one person at a time. 
My stepmom thought it was family group by family group and called my dad over to go through together. I told them that I don't think it matters and that you go one person at a time. My dad thought the same as my stepmom and got out of his line to get into her line and thus cutting in front of this one lady.
I moved over as well but went behind the lady instead. So their turn came up and they went and motioned me to come over. I told them again that I don't think that this is how it works and that you see other people going one by one. They kept motioning me over so I said sorry to the lady and went up with them. 
Right when I came over the customs lady told them that it's one person at a time unless you're with small children. I told my stepmom I told you so and she just looked really pissed and went back to the line. I moved back to my position as well. After that she wouldn't talk to me and went to sit on the other side of the full bus all angry.

The shower in my apartment is cold. Based on a thermometer, it’s coming out at about 62 degrees (f). It stays that temperature for about five minutes, then suddenly skyrockets to whatever you’ve set it to. The building is large, and has one water heater, so I assume it’s just because it takes forever to get to us. 

My husband (30m), gets extremely angry and talks about the environment, the energy waste, and just the amount of time I’m wasting. He thinks I should just suck it up and hop in, because otherwise it’s a huge waste. 

Info: I have asthma and cold water makes it hard to breathe. It doesn’t cause an asthma attack, or lock up symptoms. I don’t even know if it’s asthma related. I just can’t breathe well when I’m cold, and the shower is cold enough for me to feel that unless it’s warmed up. 

AITA for letting my shower, that takes upwards of five minutes to heat up at all, run for the multiple minutes it takes to heat up enough I can tolerate it?

Clearly it seems I’m NTA. Thank you for that.

1076,btejal,"WIBTA if I reported my nephew’s reckless driving to the cops? My cousin’s kid that I call my nephew thinks he’s the shit. He’s a senior in high school, has modelled since he was a kid, races and fixes up cars, smokes cigs and sells them to other high school kids - basically in his head, he is the epitome of cool. I powerfully disagree.

This has little impact on my life except for when my boyfriend and I theorize (in private) about all the things my cousin and cousin-in-law are doing to make him this way. They give him money, bought him a couple cars including a motorcycle to ride to school, and don’t seem to have ever disciplined him in his life. He has a minor learning disability, which I low-key think is what leads them to spoil him, but that’s enough armchair psychology for the purposes of this post.

I follow him on Instagram and saw that he posted a video of himself - as filmed by one of his friends - where he starts his car, hops out of it while it’s in motion, and starts dancing wildly next to it (Kiki style). The car is picking up speed and the door shuts by accident, so you see him continue to dance like a maniac for a few more seconds before scrambling back in. He stops it, gets out, then keeps dancing while his buddy films.

This absolutely gutted me to see. People die over mistakes less dumb than this one, so I worry for his safety when his judgement is this bad, but I also live in the same town as him and just fumed at the idea that he shares a road with me. He and his parents seem to live in a world where they’re above the law (they see themselves as very “well connected” in our town), so my temptation is to send the clip to the local PD’s non-emergency contact to report it and anonymously send the message that he is NOT above the law.

I don’t think going to his parents directly would solve anything because they’re definitely aware that this happened. As far as I can tell, their version of signalling to him their disapproval is just by not “liking” the video. 

WIBTA if I reported him to the cops? Legit can’t tell if I’m being a busybody or if it’s the right call, and the fact that he’s family is blurring my judgement here."
1077,dgam03,"AITA for being upset with my sister for getting a new dog? A bit of context: Me (21M) and my sister (23F) live with our grandmother who we moved in with to help her after our grandfather passed 3-4 years ago. I'm a substitute teacher so I stay home for most of the time and my sister is always at work, since she works in a nursing home.

When my sister broke the news of her thinking about buying a new dog, my grandmother and I essentially BEGGED her not to get it because 1) she is barely at home due to work, 2) when she is at home, she is tired from work and wants to sleep, and 3) she is usually out with her fiancee, and will mostly leave the dog here while she is gone. My grandmother and I knew that if she got a dog, we would be the ones raising it instead of her for those reasons. She does pay for its food and will fill it up when empty, along with water, however whenever she is gone, it will poop and pee in the floor, since we usually keep the doors shit due to the hot weather. We do try to get it to go outside, but there have been a number of times where it will go out, pee, and come right back in to poop. We both have grown to like the dog, but we cant stand it doing this on a daily basis. We've told her about it but she always says ""Yall dont take care of it. I buy the food and fill it up, as well as the water."" We have started leaving to doors open and it will mostly go outside now, but whenever she leaves for work, and we're both still in bed, when we wake up, we have to clean up after it while my sister does nothing except feed and water it.

AITA for being upset that she bought it when we were begging her not to?

Now, I had and have no intention of asking her out or anything like that. I was truly and honestly just trying to get to be better friends. I talked to a mutual friend of ours and told her about how we hit it off on facetime and how I had a crush on her and thought she was beautiful, but was more than likely not gonna act on it for a very long time, if ever.

She took it upon herself to tell him that I was making moves on her because ""she would tell me if he was talking to my ex"", and he started talking to me, saying ""don't do it"" and pretty much implying and saying that she's out of my league and would never go for me.

Recently I heard from a trusted friend that she had been calling me vain (not true) and a slut that had herpes (also not true, your son took my virginity mam) to all her friends, I was hurt but didn’t let it bother me at first because I eventually thought “what’s the harm?? Is Karen Martha and Patricia going to douse me in essential oils and light me on fire, no it’s fine who cares, no need to worry my boyfriend over that”

But things really got bad when we were at a barbeque on Friday, I wanted to leave early because I had a bad migraine, so he left his plate of food and insisted to drive me home. His mother then made a big deal and called after him from across the park saying, “but you haven’t finished your food” and decided to follow us. As we were getting into the car she said to his son “you better get tired of her now before she does what her family does best!” and stormed off. My parents had a rocky marriage because of ongoing affairs they had with each other, to which they confided in my boyfriend’s mother thinking she was a close friend. I felt slapped in the face and didn’t say anything back to the person who I thought was a trustworthy adult from when I was younger. During the car ride home we got into a heated argument because I was angry that he didn’t stand up for me at that moment, he told me that it doesn’t matter, there was no reasoning with her and that because he’s been saving up for our future together I won’t even have to worry about her in a short while, I felt like he kept dismissing my hurt feelings over and over again so when he dropped me off I told him that maybe we just shouldn’t have a future together and left. 

I feel horrible for ignoring his calls and messages ever since but I can’t help but get angry that he wouldn’t make an effort to defend me at all and showed no remorse for it, I would have stood up for him the other way around. AITA guys?"
1080,cj2fma,"AITA For cutting off friendship after 1 drunk night ? This happened a few days ago. TL;DR at the bottom

So I (24m)  was invited to my friends (28m) house for his birthday, I asked him if I could invite a friend (23f) and he said yes it's fine.

Arrive at the party we start having drinks, my friend shows up and we start playing drinking games. She and I have played drinking games before. All went well except she got drunk very quickly. I could see around the table people were getting slightly irritated by her who is now drunk to which I pulled her to the side and told her, I think it's best if she go gets some fresh air outside with the other people. 

Maybe after 10 mins we finished the game and went outside, 5 mins my friend starts throwing up, so I let her finish and guide her to the bathroom so she can finish throw up there and got her a spare wash cloth so she can wipe where needed because she spilled on her dress. While helping her, I ask if she wanted to lay down in the spare room and sleep for a bit to which she replied she doesn't feel comfortable sleeping in a stranger's house (fair enough). She wanted to go sit in her car, in the drivers seat to which I made it my duty to prevent that just in case she decides to drive off in that state.

After some arguing and she really went off on me to leave her the f*** alone and I'm not the boss of her etc. I suggested to her that I drive her home with her car and then take an uber back to the party but she said no. I told her she can sit in the passenger seat and to contact someone to fetch her then she said no her brother is on his way, a struggle ensued and I manage to get her car keys out of her hands as she was in no condition to drive.

Eventually she sits in the car while I have her car keys after she threatened to call the police 

After maybe 20-30mins the police arrives and we are in shock. We speak to the police and we let her talk first, (to my shock) she tells the police that I'm trying to sleep with her and that we drugged her (remember this friend and I know each other for 8 years by now). So I was shocked and we all denied her allegations. The police asked for the car keys and we gave it them, then we all just told her she must f*** off.

When I got home, I just sent her a text to tell her I've never been so humiliated in my life and that she should lose my number as I want nothing to do with her. Deleted her number and all social connections.

AITA for cutting off all connection with her and wanting to not be associated with her in anyway, effectively cutting her entirely out of my life ?

TL;DR Friend gets drunk, shouts at me in front of my friends, we take away her car keys, she calls the cops and when she leaves I message her to never contact me again."
1081,b9ii97,"AITA for telling a trusted friend another friend asked me for nudes? I (f16) was asked for nudes from my close friend (m18) who I think of as a brother. He brought it up as a complete joke, and since we have joke flirted with each other in the past (of course he knows it is a joke, we've discussed an actual relationship in the past and he decided he did not want it, and I was in a committed relationship at the time this was asked of me), I didn't think much of it. Suddenly, he seems a bit pushy on this joke. I tell him to drop it as he surely doesn't actually want them. To which he asks if I would be upset if he did. He said it would be pretty hot, and I declined. He asked if it would still be a no if he paid me, I told him I did not want to do anything of the sort, especially at this age. He kept badgering me about it until I eventually told him to not text me anymore about this and turned very cold towards him. He later apologized (more for my reaction than his behavior tbh) and I accepted. 

However, this encounter left a cold feeling in my gut. I was currently in my first relationship, and this ask left me to wonder if I was seen as the type of girl who would send nudes to pretty much any guy who asked. If I had somehow built up a reputation of that sort (not a bad thing but a. illegal at my age and b. I was raised very traditionally and am still following the belief of waiting until marriage). I reached out to a trusted individual about the scenario and she assured me he was just being gross. I felt better about myself. 

Fast forward a month and a few friends (the boy and girl mentioned previously included) and I are hanging out and, skipping over unimportant details, I ended up making a joke he was a pervert (as we all do to each other, this is not a rare joke), and my friend I had reached out to laughed really hard. He looked at the two of us suspiciously, and quickly leaves. I didn't suspect much of it, and I get home and check my phone, and I have a message from him. 

""Sorry I trusted you with an odd request, it wont happen again"" and then he proceeds to block me over every form of communication we share.

1082,cqa5yh,"AITA for telling my co-worker what to do So this story starts back a year ago, I work for a large mail manufacturer and had been there for 2 years at the time. We hire on just about anyone that can pass a background check. I was made a team lead about a month before the incident and was still very fresh to the role. Before becoming a lead, I was tasked with training the replacement for the machine I was responsible for in order to move on to my new position. The replacement, we’ll call C, was known for being difficult to work with and smelled of alcohol while on the job, my sense of smell has never been great so I could never notice and never became a problem while training him. Well, a month after being a team lead, my boss’s boss tells me that C needs to run a particular job ASAP, that I needed to tell him, and he had no choice in matter due to the urgency of the work (my boss was out for the day). I go to C and tell him exactly that and this came from above me. C gets pissed, goes straight to HR, and then leaves for the day. HR did not send him home, he walked out. The whole dispute get reconciled and I felt shitty for this whole incident, boss’s boss says don’t worry about it, I move on. Zoom forward to a year later, now, I’ve moved on to a new shift, and a new position that has nothing to do with C except lining up the work before his shift starts. I haven’t talk to C in almost the entire time since then, and I have apologized for that time already. Today, I’m running behind in bring the material for the day to the machine C currently runs, I try to help by asking him where he would like the material and if there is anything I can do to help. He turns around and talks quiet enough just for me to hear and clear enough, “I haven’t forgiven you for what you said to me before, and I haven’t forgotten when you told me I didn’t have a choice. I don’t want you talking to me.” I’m not good with confrontation, and I apologized again. But I got no response and I’m feeling worse than when this first happened. AITA?"
1083,b2a1md,"AITA For blocking my little cousin on Instagram? Here's a little backstory: I am currently visiting my home country Uzbekistan from the US, Having the opportunity to even go to the US from my country is considered a big deal here.,. I haven't seen my little cousin in around 4-5years. He is 14 years old and once he found out I had an instagram he immediately made one.  If im completely honest with you, He is SUPER annoying and is constantly making dirty jokes which aren't even funny. He has this annoying habit of bringing up the fact that I came from the US and sarcastically saying that im cooler and richer than he is for that fact. (I'm not even rich!)  Ever since I came from the US he would constantly make jokes about how rich I am (which im not), and jokingly ask for 50$, this pisses me off (because he literally makes these jokes everyday), and when he notices that he says something like ""Alright sorry, you're cool you're from America, and we're not."" This further pisses me off.  Now to the instagram part, when he made one he obviously requested to follow me, I thought about it for a minute but eventually just accepted it and followed him back.  Next day when I see his profile I noticed he followed all my followers, I was kind of annoyed ( BUT THIS WASNT THE TIPPING POINT.) I was already having thoughts about blocking him but what made me super pissed was that he constantly kept showing me pictures of some of my girl friends and would say some annoying dumb shit like ""Is this your girlfriend??"" I'd say ""No"" to which he'd reply to "" Don't lie."" (he did this with multiple girls throughout the day) That was the last straw, so later on I blocked him, and when he found out he got kind of upset and hasnt talked to me in a while, I feel like what I did was kind of harsh but I honestly dont want to unblock him, AITA?"
1084,cib7gl,"WIBTA for asking my mom if I could spend more time at my dad’s house? My brother (11M) and I (15F) have divorced parents. My dad moved out several years ago (maybe 6-ish years) and lives with his new girlfriend and her kid (15M). My mom lives in the same house we all used to and is single.

My brother and I go to our dad’s house every Wednesday as well as every other weekend, spending the remainder of our time at our mom’s. Holidays are split evenly. This has been consistent since the divorce.

At my dad’s, his gf and her son moved into our house around June 2018. We all get along pretty well for the most part. I consider her son to be my brother, while I don’t consider her a mother figure in my life at all. 

When my brother and I are at my mom’s house, it’s just my dad, his gf, and her son at their house. My dad treats his gf’s son like his own, as his bio dad is not very active in his life. They seem like a complete, happy family.

Because of how little time my brother and I spend at our dad’s house, I feel disconnected from my dad, his gf, and her son. I feel like the three of them are a closer family than my dad, my brother and I are. I feel like if I spent more time at my dad’s house, I’d bond more with them and feel more included and like part of the family, which is all I really want.

Before the divorce, my mom worked from home, so my dad pays her child support, as she doesn’t make as much money due to being unemployed for so long. She can always provide my brother and I with whatever we need/want but struggles with not being able to take us places/do fun activities with us. This is a touchy subject for her since she knows that our dad makes more money and is able to do more with us.

This doesn’t make me love my mom any less, I actually could not give a shit how much “fun stuff” we do at either house. However, her tendency to be insecure and emotional about this topic makes it hard for me to bring up spending more time at my dad’s house.

I was thinking about just asking to go to my dad’s house on Tuesday nights (in addition to Wednesday and every other weekend) making it more of a 50/50 split (which she STRONGLY fought against in divorce court). I don’t want to make her insecure, because it’s not her fault I want to spend more time with my family at my dad’s. She would assume that I didn’t want to be at her house because she “wasn’t good enough for me”. She hates when I talk about wanting to be there, and she gets upset when I tell her about my good weekend I spent at my dad’s. 

WIBTA for asking her to spend more time at my dad’s house?"
1085,cbrg9g,"AITA for not letting my housemate use the bathroom in my room? A little background - I share a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom apartment with a buddy of mine. He lives on the first floor, which also has our living room, kitchen, and a bathroom. My bedroom is on the second floor and has personal bathroom. I also pay $50 more in rent per month rather than an even split due to having the room with a personal bathroom. 

Here’s the kicker - my bathroom has no door. It has a very large frame, much like you’d see in a fairly wide hallway (it’s about a 3rd of the size of the wall). 

His  toilet is currently inoperable due to a system blockage. He tried plunging. It’s been about 5 days and he hasn’t done anything to get it fixed. I was out of town for a few days, so I’m sure he was just using mine and procrastinated dealing with fixing his. No big deal, I generally don’t have an issue with him using the one in my room. In fact, we left the apt for about 2 hrs for a function and he took a #2 in my bathroom before we left. Again no problem. 


Here’s where I can’t decide if I’m the AH or not. 

We pulled in from said function, and while I’m parking he says “my stomach has been killing me, I’m about to blow up the bathroom”. 

I said something along the lines of “dude I’m about to go sleep in there (it was late where I am). I don’t want to smell your shit while I try to sleep I’ll drive you to the gas station”. 

He got pissed and we had a bit of a back and forth in which I conceded and just told him to spray a ton of fabreez and light a candle. He declined and was very passive aggressive. 

Here’s my logic:

1) He should have taken care of his toilet days ago

2) He could have asked to stop at any point on the drive home, or the gas station I offered to drive him to is literally on the same block. 

3) I pay more in rent for the convenience of the bathroom in my room. I have never had issue with sharing it, besides tonight because I was going immediately to my room to shower and go to bed. 

I’d just like some perspective on if I’m the asshole and being selfish, or if I have the right to be annoyed with this situation."
1086,d3cb84,"AITA for bringing someone ""new"" to ""our"" table? At my school every ""group"" has a table that they all sit at. Sometimes 2 groups share a table, sometimes 3, sometimes only the 1. In my ""group"" we take up about 80-85% of the table we sit at and another group take up the other 15-20. In the mornings, when we are waiting for the bell to ring we sit at the table. I started going to a basketball club recently and quickly grew fond or a boy we will call Jake. Now Jake is very tall, and extremely quiet. I barely hear him when we talk. But when I walked into school I saw him wandering around and asked if he had any freinds to sit with, I thought they might have come in late.

After some small talk I spotted our table and noticed 2 empty seats. I quickly lead him over and invited him to sit with me, and about 5 other people. They all gave me weird looks, and later asked wtf was I doing. I told them I knew him and I thought he didn't have any freinds to sit with yet (he just moved into the school and, again, is very quiet). They seemed very hostile towards me afterwards and when I initially took him to our table, they grew silent. 

I don't know if it's because he was taller than all of them, (we are all quite short) or if they knew him and didn't like him but it seemed like they did not feel comfertable sitting with him. 

Another note, I honestly tried my best to push this out my mind and ignore it, but it may be worth mentioning that everyone at the time was white, (including me) but Jake was black. I do not want to believe this for a second, but thought every detail may count.

I assume it's a well known fact that a lot of Jewish people have curly, unruly hair.

So for years my mother who breeds dogs has tried to give my family a dog. Around April of this year we cave in and say yes we will take one. 
Then the puppies are born they are 4 weeks old as of now. 
In the 4 weeks i have been told a few things. One the dog must be created (we don't like this idea for many reason). Next we had a dog years ago that stayed under the stairs in our home. (No door closet gave her the run of a hall way gated off when we were gone or eating. 15 ft by 4 1/2 ft room ) This wasn't okay with her. Then now she wants to breed said dog for puppies (if it were our choice we would get her fixed, just a preference level). All of this above we were to deal with. Then she flat out told me said dog will have a name of an nother pet already at our home, her words were deal with it. This was done over text's, around 2pm yesterday. Mind you i said nothing trying to find the nice way untill my SO gets home. Him and i talk about it, he says he don't want the dog now, Nor do i. We can go buy a dog without so many strings. So i texted her around 5 pm somthing along the lines of ""*** and i have talked, he is gonna go get us another dog. Seeing we are ready for our family to have a dog. There are to many strings attached with your, strings that we feel will only hurt our kids in the long run. So this way there aren't any strings attached and no one gets hurt. I'm sorry for any confusion this has caused. Good luck with your puppies they sure are cute.""
About 10 mins later my phome rings it's in the same room SO is in, he picks it up to get cursed out, he hangs up on her. He texted her from my phome he will just go pay for a dog if she is going to act like this. I came back to said room and he starts telling me what happened. I block her, but all the messages she sent after this go to my blocked box. I guess from what she is saying i wasn't civilized about the choice of not wanting said dog. That I'm worthless, and refuse to have fun. Not to contact her or my father. Btw not the 1st time she has just flaked out. I want to go no contact with her, because life would be so much better without having to walk on egg shells around her.

Summ. Mother tried to give family a dog that she turned in to a marionette. Way to many strings, we deside we don't want said dog. Am I the asshole"

We decided we need a roommate so the rent is cheaper, He invited our mate from work. My friend overheard it and said it would be cheaper if we all move in a house, we got all excited and so we started to plan everything.

It went downhill for me when she started telling us what she wanted:
1. She preferably want a house.
2. She wants her own bathroom (which was optional)
3. She wanted a place near her second job
4. She needs to move out as soon as possible so she wants us to find a place in a few weeks.

She was the only one who had a second job, she tells us that she is too busy from working and so she wanted us to call all the places possible. However, every time we find a place she would find something she doesnt like about it. We would have disagreements, mostly about the rent. She shows us pictures of houses she wants but it was always way out of our budget and if we didnt want to go look at a place because it was expensive she would say something along the lines of  ""I am so tired from my other job at least i'm willing to do this for us""

The last straw was when she told us in our group chat that we should move out without her just because she had an argument with our other friend. But when he apologized she replied a few hours later like nothing happened, saying she was acting like that just because she was exhausted and stressed. When we said we didnt want to move with them anymore and we hoped to not take it personally because just recently my husband and I heard the news from his sister that she is sick and we might visit her often and that would be difficult to do if we pay rent. She said that we flaked on her and that she sacrificed her sleep and wasted her time. She also said that we knew she had a deadline and she felt disappointed in us that we did not tell her sooner. Lastly, she texted me basically saying she didnt want to be friends anymore and that all good things must come to an end (whatever that means)

We also all work together so whenever she sees us she avoids us, I also have a feeling that she talks about us behind our backs and makes us look like we we abandoned her, which was proven correct because we have mutual friends at work that told me about it."
1091,aybb85,"AITA for wanting to adopt my niece? My brother lost custody of his two children and his ex lost custody of the other two as well.  So my mom is raising four children, only two of which actually are biologically related to us. My mother lives in the projects, can barely pay her bills, and is mentally and physically abusive to these children on occasion.  I spoke with DCS and they said, “Hitting a child in the face doesn’t necessarily constitute abuse.” So there’s that.  However, my brother who has been six years sober is attempting to regain custody of his two.  He isn’t necessarily able to get the youngest two as they aren’t biologically his.  My youngest niece is seven. Again she’s not biologically mine but she’s been my niece since she was born.  She lived with me when she came home from the hospital along with her mother. Anyway, she told me recently multiple times that she wanted to live with me because her sister (11) beats her up all the time and tells her she’s unwanted.  My sweet seven year old niece told me that’s terrified that her biological dad (an abusive sex offender) will come steal her away because that’s what her sister tells her. And that her real mom and dad don’t love her and that’s why they don’t see her, all because my biological niece tells her this. 

I asked my mother if I could adopt her. I live in a different state. I’m in the military and I have two children on my own. My reasons were to get her away from her abusive sister and my abusive mother, to offer her a home with a mother and a father in it, and to give her something that she doesn’t think was given out of obligation, something that nobody can ever take away.  

My mother screamed and cussed me when we talked about this. “How dare you try to take her Way from me.” The evidence for how much better quality of life can b me for a child with a mother and a father is staggering, but my mother wouldn’t hear anything.   

tl;dr - I want to adopt my niece because my mother is a crazy person.  She said I’m an asshole for suggesting it.  "

I am the sous chef of a small farm to table restaurant about 30 miles from where I grew up. The executive chef an I have a system for reviewing applicants; I conduct the first interview, and if I think they have potential, I set up a second interview with the executive. We have worked together for years and he trusts my judgement.

Last week, I had an interview with a name I immediately recognized, lets call him Jake. Jake was in my high school graduating class, and for the good part of junior and senior year he made my life hell. Now I wasn't particularly popular in high school, but I was never bullied, except by this guy. His favorite thing to do would be to loudly insult me in front of his friends, then force me to leave because I wasn't cool enough to be around his cool friends. This happened at lunch, gym, assemblies, and sporting  events. I distinctively remember one football game where he kept telling everyone how much weight I had gained recently, calling me a fat fuck and making me sit in the bleachers on the other side of the field. I still think about that stuff today to be honest.

Fast forward 10 years later, and he is sitting in front of me interviewing for a job. I decide to not bring this up, and he never mentions any of it. His interview actually went really well, and he had a pretty good resume. But before we even start talking, I know I am not going to hire this guy.  I finish the interview, tell him I will be in touch, and he leaves. I later call him and tell him we accepted someone else for the position. 

As i was driving home I started to feel a little guilty. This guy was definitely qualified, and we don't see too many applicants being in a small town. High school was 10 years ago, I know I was a different person then, and maybe Jake has changed for the better. 

Am I wrong to judge someone for their actions so long ago? I definitely feel like a bit of an asshole, but honestly if I had to work with him again it would bring up a lot of memories I try not to think about anymore."

I told him it might take me a while to fully trust him again because of what happened and even before we started dating i've had trust issues with my dad and brother (he knew about these issues). I asked him to please be patient with me and communicate our emtions. He agreed.

I had trouble telling personal things and believing certain things he said, and i said all i needed from him was reassurance. He was good on his part.

Some months pass and i feel like im almost there but not quite yet. Eventually we get into a spat and he felt that by taking him back i should be able to fully trust him by then. I know its been some time since then and we are in good spot rn, but the thought has nipped at the back of my mind since. Was i wrong for taking so long to to fully trust him again?"
1096,bk95sz,"AITA for implying a heavy set girl should check the mirror before calling people fat? I work with a heavy set girl who has taken to calling people Heffer, which is a reference to a cow. She’s basically calling people fat, and some of the people she refers to as heffer are actually a bit heavy. So I’m walking down the hallway at work yesterday and I hear her call out: “move it along, heffer.”

I turned to see her smiling, so I asked her if she thought she of all people had the right to call people fat. I don’t think she understood what I meant at first, so I said to her that she’s half my height and probably twice my weight. Between the two of us, she’s the heffer. 

Now, I’m not friends with this person. We don’t have inside jokes. I only learned her first name recently. Anyway, she started crying and this morning I’m in the office first thing explaining that the whole situation was misinterpreted and I was only responding to her using the word first. 

So, AITA for calling a fat girl fat who’s calling people fat?

Edit: I know, I know. It’s spelt heifer. Thank you all for correcting me, however I’m not going to go back and correct myself."
1097,endeku,"AITA for telling my sister not to transracially adopt? My sister (32F) and her husband (32M) aren't able to have biological children. This was a huge stressor for my sister, who's always dreamed of having children, and getting the news of her infertility caused her to fall into a major depression a few years ago. Now, however, she and her husband have begun to move toward adopting a child. For a long time, my sister had a lot of trouble getting excited about adoption as an option, but she finally seems genuinely thrilled about this avenue for child-rearing, and they've taken the first steps towards becoming adoptive parents. 

A few weeks ago, my sister, her husband, our older brother (36M), his wife and baby, and I (27F) were at our parents house for a nice family dinner. My sister was very eagerly showing us her and her husband's profile on an adoption agency website. This profile has a ton of info on them as a couple: their jobs, where they live, their parenting ideology, their favorite movies, you name it. One section, though, included a paragraph on how my sister and her husband were committed to raising a child from any racial or ethnic background, and giving them the necessary support to feel connected to their cultural roots. 

Here's the thing, though. My sister has never been very culturally sensitive. She's very openly anti-PC, consistently says and does things (in public!) that make me cringe from how offensive and out-of-touch she is, and gets very offended when people correct her. She's not hateful, but she cares very little to make an effort to be sensitive to other people's backgrounds. 

After dinner, I found my sister in the kitchen alone, and mentioned that it might not be such a good idea to adopt a baby that wasn't white. I told her that transracial adoption comes with a ton of complications that I wasn't sure she was prepared to deal with. 

She flipped out. She screamed at me that I was being racist, that I didn't trust her as a potential mother, and that it was cruel of me to question her when she's so excited about making moves toward having a baby. 

Hearing all the yelling, our mother came in to find out what was going on, and pretty much told me that I was an unbelievable jerk, and that I need to be supportive of my sister. I didn't apologize, as I think not putting a child into a potentially harmful situation is worth upsetting my sister. I went home right after that, and haven't talked to my sister since.

1098,dhtqh5,"AITA For MY Friends Girlfriends Actions? So real quick let me explain my self (excuse the format; I don't quite know how to write one of these)

Me = Me

My Friend/Her Boyfriend = F

His Girlfriend = GF

&#x200B;

Background:

So I had a couple of friends over for movie night and along with some of my other friends, F brought his GF along with him. We watched a couple movies until about 1 am and they all left from there. So as they were leaving, GF walks up to me and says she needs a ride home. I ask her why she didn't just ask F, and she said she was uncomfortable with it because they were on shaky ground. I asked if she could call anyone else, and she said it was late and none of her friends were probably up. So I just want 2 things. One, I want her out of my house so I can go to bed. And two, I don't want beef with F over this, because he tends to twist situations. So I get my keys and I give her a ride home. She lives about 20 mins away and in the middle of nowhere, so there is a lot of back roads I have to take.

So we're half way to her house, and we were chatting, and out of the blue, she grabs my inner thigh. I'm very clear with her that she is not going to do this (""this"" being anything sexual). She continues and I tell her I will stop the car and make her walk if she doesn't stop. She stops, and lean backs in the seat, and sighs. She is obviously pissed off because she isn't getting what she wants. This happened last night / early this morning.

I woke up this morning with an angry text from F saying how disloyal I was to him, because I fricked his girl. This caught me so off guard, and I got really defensive. I told him what happened, and he said GF said different. He said that she, in very great detail, described how she did the deed to me in the car. I told him it was bullshit, and he said he didn't want to talk to me. This, keep in mind, happened about 7 am this morning. F didn't break up with GF, but he did ""break up"" his friendship with me.

&#x200B;

Question:

So regarding this situation, I can't see how any of this gets laid on me. It would've been so much worse if she slept at my house, and she should have just got a ride with her F. So tell me, AITA?

1099,dc7cb0,"WIBTA for telling my girlfriend she needs to pay me back for her cats surgery, or to rehome them? I(M29) live with my girlfriend (F27) and our son (5). I am definitely a dog person, but have never gotten an animal because those are expenses I just cant afford. However, I have accepted these cats as part of the family as long as she is the primary ""parent"" for them.

As a backstory, Finances are a sore spot in our relationship.  She makes just as much money as me, but doesnt contribute to our household. Just to her needs, our son, and ""date night"" for us.  Everything else she pays for is exclusively hers.  I have had many conversations about her not really being a partner with money in our relationship, and its just ends n fights.  This is important to this topic.

She has had Cat 1 for 6 years, she has had Cat 2 for 5 years.  2 months ago, she found a stray(Cat 3)  and absolutely fell in love with him.  He reminded her of her cat she had growing up.  Cat 3 had to have come from a home because he was lovey with both her and I, as well as our kid.  He got along with the other cats etc. I told her we cannot afford another cat (as we all know animals can be damn expensive if they are sick or injured) so she adopted Cat 3 without my knowledge and brought him home 6 weeks ago. (Through the proper channels with the shelter, etc.) Not happy about that

A few days ago Cat 3 went out of the house for his routine evening stroll through the yard and was attacked by a feral cat and had some serious damage to his face.  We thought it could be tended to from home, but changed our tune the next day once he wasnt so skiddish and i could get a better look at it.

I took him to the animal hospital and he had to have some pretty serious surgery, to the tune of $1200.  My girlfriend gave me $50 dollars to ""help pay the costs"" and doesnt plan on paying more as ""money is just too tight"".  She makes good money and has very limited bills, at least that I know if. I did not know I was going to be the one paying for it, I just happened to work 3rd shift so I was home all day doing the errands.

Im livid as hell.  I had to pay 1150 dollars (my entire emergency fund) for a cat, I didnt want in the first place, that we (IE: I) couldnt AFFORD, that she adopted behind my back.

WIBTA for telling her she either needs to completely pay me back, or she needs to rehome  Cat 3 (Or all the cats if she is so broke)?both of those options will cause a massive fight.

None of the other cats have ever been to a vent, besides their initial shots so I dont know if this would be the status quo, and I havent asked as ive been pretty pissed about this expense. I really am not about to pay for her Cat obsession, and frivilous spontaneous cat adoptions, when the precious ""extra"" money I save is an emergency fund for my son, house repairs, to cover sick days, medical issues, or for any other emergency?

Am I out of line; for this line of thinking?"
1100,buh3pu,"AITA for not letting my husband's ex wife's daughter not come over anymore? My husband was with his ex wife for basically her daughter's entire life(he is not the bio father) ~5 years. They also have a son together. When my husband and I got together, both kids would spend time with us and stay over, I'd babysit them while their mom worked, etc. Their mother stopped bothering to communicate, dropping the kids off whenever she felt like it, be it 10 hours early, or 2 hours late. She began not paying her bills and telling family members we were not paying her child support(untrue, she gets it automatically the beginning of each month. When I spoke with her about it, I let her know she had to let us know what she was doing because husband and I cannot make any plans when we have no idea when the other kids would show up. She began screaming in my face in front of my mother and father in law that I wasnt their mother and that she would be coming for my paycheck. Again, I just literally told her she needed to let us know if she was going to be dropping off the kids at any time other than the agreed upon time. After this, she began accusing my of trying to harm her daughter. She has told all of my husbands family that I have tried to push her daughter down the stairs, that I ignore her, and that I have purposefully been phasing her out of my husband's life because I'm jealous. At this point I wrote it off as crazy, but then she began threatening to get restraining orders against me and that she was going to be going to the police and cps because I am abusing her daughter. I went out town and she texted me saying she bet I was stupid enough to come back and other thinly veiled aggressive comments. When I returned, I told my husband that i do not feel comfortable with her behavior and I felt until she stopped threatening me and telling people I was trying to hurt her daughter, maybe it was best that her daughter didnt come over any longer. I hated to do it because her daughter very clearly preferred to be at our house, but her mother has been getting increasingly aggressive. Now my in laws are telling me I'm the one who is wrong in this situation, that the mothers behavior is ""just how she is"", and I need to get over it. Honestly I'm just at a loss here and the only loser right now in this situation is her poor daughter. However, a family member went through a similar thing where the mother DID follow through on threats and was dragged through a lengthy police process for it(family member was cleared because they didnt do anything). I feel like my husband should be firmly telling everyone that the mother is wrong and cannot act this way towards me, but he claims he doesnt want to start arguments.

Edit: I should have specified she CAN still come over, I just told my husband for my own safety I will not stay or be in the home while she is. Her mother, when we said that her actions toward me were not ok, is the one who is now keeping her from coming over at all. Sorry for not explaining that more clearly, I am very upset."
1101,bl2dtz,"AITA for being pissed at my maid of honour? Hi all. This is my first post here (and not my usual account). I am getting married in three weeks, and it isn't a big fairytale affair, just getting married at the town hall and onto reception. I didn't want an army of bridesmaids so I told my two best friends that they could both be maid of honour and that was enough for me. I know how frustrating it can be when people pick a dress for bridesmaids to wear etc and I wanted them both to be happy and comfortable on the day, so I put them in a whatsapp group and told them to pick some dresses and run them by me. This was beginning of January. 

&#x200B;

7 weeks before the wedding the maid of honour in question (lets call her Janine) starts going on about how 'we need to get this sorted'. Picking a dress to wear is the only job I gave her. It became clear that she wasn't going to do this so I have spent hundreds of pounds sending her dresses (my mum has too), asking her to send back the ones that she does not want. She still has all these dresses, and hasn't sent me a pic of herself in any of them. My mum has missed the deadline to send hers back and has lost all the money. 

&#x200B;

When I ask her to send pics all I get is 'I feel so obese in them all...but I guess I am the least fat in one of them'. A little bit of context: I spent the whole of our adolescence on my hands and knees every time before we went out telling her that she was not fat and that she looked great (she is UK size 6/8). I'm upset that I am so stressed with everything else that I am back doing this again, not to mention that I already know I will have to spend the whole morning of my wedding reassuring her. This is why I wanted her to pick her own dress, but didn't bother to try anything on.

&#x200B;

I completely understand that she has body image issues, but I'm so scared that she is going to make the whole day about herself and her image. I am going to be really nervous in the morning and I'm not sure I can deal with her constantly repeating over and over how bad she looks.

 

I haven't told her that I'm a bit pissed at her because when I have tried in the past she gives me the silent treatment, becomes cold and turns it around on me. I really don't want that atmosphere when she arrives for the wedding.

&#x200B;

So, am I the asshole for:

&#x200B;

1) Being annoyed that hundreds of pounds have been wasted on these dresses?

2) Should I have given her the option to choose her own dress, or did I create this whole problem?

3) Not wanting her to turn the morning of the wedding into the Janine show

&#x200B;

Just worried that I am the one being insensitive...I don't want to be one of these brides that orders people around (hence why I wanted her to pick her own dress!)"
1102,c7g6mt,"AITA - Dinnertime Dilemma We had BLTs for dinner. I prepared all of the ingredients, then made my sandwich and ate it.

He thinks that the meal is not made until it is served to him on his plate. Obviously he's not wrong that some meals are pre-assembled and ready to eat, such as a casserole, but my argument is that a sandwich should be assembled by the eater so that the bread doesn't get soggy.

Yesterday, I make a joke about how funny it would if I wore a bra to school, or out in public. A different friend, who’s not part of the joke, decides to add “you can borrow one of mine”, and **purely within the context of the joke**, I said “no, yours aren’t big enough.” She gets quite annoyed, claiming I objectify woman, and teasing me about a past failed relationship. I’ve already apologized and she is still angry with me. AITA for this comment? (No, I promise I’m not fudging any of this to make myself look better.

1104,ak7xaf,"AITA for taking my family dog to the vet This happened a while ago during the Christmas holiday. I came home to my parents' for the first time in 3 months and find the family dog with a HUGE, baseball sized oozing lump on her chest. Bloody and sore. I freak out a little but my parents tell me it's 'fine' and that it doesn't seem to be bothering her. I'm not convinced though and I start asking about emergency vet appointments, but they get annoyed and tell me it's 'taken care of' and she has a biopsy in 3 weeks time. They're visibly annoyed that I won't shut up about it so I stop hassling.

&#x200B;

3 weeks seems like a ridiculously long time away for something so horrific. It was making an odour and I was concerned about infection. I secretly call the vet to try and make an emergency appointment but they say there's nothing they can do before christmas (in 2 days) so I decide to hold out until then.

&#x200B;

The dog is, admittedly, fine. She's acting completely normal, despite this mountain on her chest, aside from licking it and it oozing and bleeding everywhere. Christmas comes and I vent to my grandma that I'm really worried about the dog. She knows the vet personally so manages to get me an appointment for the day after xmas. I take the dog in secret because I don't want to initiate any more arguments with my parents, I just want her seen asap. She gets x-rayed and has the biopsy. He warns me that it's very likely cancerous which upsets me but I understand. Costs me about $800 up front and I pay it. I come home and when my parents realise what I've done, all hell breaks loose.

&#x200B;

I get screamed at for 'going behind their back'. That it's their dog, not mine any more, and it was all under control until I got involved. That I had 'cried' to my grandma and embarrassed the both of them and made out that they were terrible people to the rest of the family. I fought my reasoning but it just fuelled their anger and it turned into a screaming match that I'm sure the neighbours could hear, and then I was blamed for 'ruining christmas'. No matter what I said, I couldn't convince them that I was just concerned about the dog's health, and that i wasn't just trying to publicly shame them.

&#x200B;

My parents live in a very small house and there's no real privacy at all so I left before things became aggressive and drove south for 2 hours. Slept that night in my car in -5C (because lord knows i had no money left for a hotel). All the while getting conflicting texts from my parents 'we're sorry this happened, plz come home' to 'youve ruined everything, the dog is warm and happy in our bed despite you not being here'. 9pm the following day I decide to drive back home to try and salvage things, and everyone just acts like it didn't happen, which I'm fine with... The dog has a huge cone of shame on her head which my parents mutter 'unnecessary' every so often. I endure the next 5 days at home for the holidays before finally getting to leave.

&#x200B;

The results have since come back, and we now know she does have cancer, has about 6 months to live, but currently isn't in any severe pain or discomfort, despite this absolutely horrendous lump. My parents haven't tried to pay back the vet expenses, but I'm 80% ok with that.

&#x200B;

I don't really know if I messed up. On one hand, I grew up with that dog and love her, but it's true that I'm not there to walk her or help pay for food.. she's not really my dog. I should've told them I was taking her to the vet, but I was worried they would cancel the appointment or something and ruin this chance. I was angry at them for not taking her sooner, but my parents don't have much money at all and I know they wanted to prioritise christmas for me and my brother, seeing as the dog was acting okay at the time, and leave the vet expenses for January. They had been living with the dog looking the way she does for weeks at that point, but I had only just seen it and reacted very hastily because of the shock, I understand. And in the end, the dog WOULD have been fine for 3 weeks, just like my parents said. There's a lot of factors involved that are really making this a grey area for me.

&#x200B;

EDIT: if you go on my latest posts, I made a post on a veterinary subreddit with a photo of the lump asking for advice. Just so you can get an idea of how it looked."
1105,e0xf67,"WIBTA for canceling a visit after my mom got married? Would I be the asshole for canceling my families Thanksgiving trip to visit my mom?

So my mom and I have always had a complicated relationship. I didn’t have the best childhood and I blame a lot of it on her choice in men. My dad was a deadbeat and she later married a mean drunk. Stepdad passed a few years ago and she announced in June this summer she was starting to date. She met a nice man but it wasn’t serious, she said. Great! I was happy she wasn’t alone anymore. She deserves to get out there again. Then in August she announced their engagement. I was a little taken aback by this since she had said it wasn’t serious. I live hours away and haven’t met this person yet. So we made plans to visit for Thanksgiving. Then I could get to know him and put my worries at ease. They were planning on a church wedding in May she told me. I don’t get the rush but it’s not my wedding and I don’t have to live with the man so I congratulated her and tried to adopt the “if she’s happy, I’m happy” attitude even though it does give me an uneasy feeling.

Well, I called Thursday night last week to talk about the specifics of our travel plans. She decided to drop the bomb that THEY GOT MARRIED TODAY! And it’s a secret from the rest of the family. I am so uncomfortable with the whole situation now. I feel hurt she didn’t tell us or want us there. And my unease has only grown at the fact that it’s a secret! 

In the past when we have visited we stay at her house but now with a stranger (to me-and her too if I’m honest about it!) in the house I just am not comfortable with that. I have young daughters that I have to protect and I already know her track record with men. So tell me:

1106,b8wbcl,"AITA for expecting my boyfriend to feed me? Some context: my boyfriend and I both live with our parents, but sleep over at each other's houses regularly. We're both students at the same uni, but don't have the same classes. My place is over an hour and a half from the uni, his is 20min away.

The issue: when he stays at my place, I get myself up in time to get ready and pack my lunch, as well as his. I also either get him breakfast at home or make sure we are at uni early enough to get the free breakfast provided before class.

When I stay at his place, he never provides me any breakfast, or offers me anything to take for lunch. I get coffee in the morning only if I make it myself. I hate buying food at uni because it's so expensive, as well as unhealthy, which he knows.

AITA for expecting that he makes me lunch or at least breakfast, when I do the same for him?


EDIT: I've spoken to him about it on multiple occasions, he just gets really annoyed and nothing changes. 

EDIT2: He doesn't make himself breakfast or lunch, I've only seen him take lunch once when his mum packed it (he thanked her profusely and didn't provide me anything). I also want to emphasize that I don't expect him to cook me an entire meal, just making a sandwich or offering me the cereal or leaving 10 minutes earlier so I could get free breakfast on campus would be just as good.

EDIT3: He does often complain about how much money he's wasting on lunch and how he should save more (even to the point of telling me off for buying a coffee because it was a waste of money). He also does get hungry I'm the morning, he usually buys breakfast if he has the time, or complains about not having time to get breakfast. So although unasked for, I don't think he completely doesn't like having a packed lunch.

1107,b4a3vv,"AITA for asking a girl to stop eating in class? In class today the usual late bird came in with very smelly soup, a big matcha frappucino, and a bag of croutons. She sat right beside me and started loudly slurping her soup. Now, I don't like soup. To me it kind of looks like barf. And this soup was very pungent. It smelled like fish chowder but was also very tomatoey. She also started slurping her drink very loudly and started eating her croutons very loudly. At one point she started dumping them in her mouth from the bag.  


I tried to ignore her but then she started leaning closer to me and was looking at what I was doing on my laptop. I should mention that I have sensory issues and was already getting overwhelmed by the smell of the soup. Her chewing in my ear just tipped me over the edge.  


I turned to her and asked, in an admittedly more aggressive tone than I meant to ""can you please stop doing that? It's really distracting.""  


I really didn't expect her to look so hurt. Like, she was acting as if I had just called her fat or something. She put the lid back on her soup and I saw her lip quiver a little. I haven't been able to stop thinking about this all day and I feel so bad. So, am I the asshole?"
1108,b7tcdx,"AITA for ending a friendship over her cat obsession? This happened 4 years ago. I've always been conflicted about whether I was overreacting or not.

My mother was diagnosed with inoperable cancer 4 years ago, and passed away within 5 months of diagnoses. It was a rough 5 months as my father and I did the majority of the caretaking for her.

At the same time a woman I've known since I was 14, (we were in our early 30s at this point),  had a pet die. It happened the same night I found out my mother had brain tumors. I tried to let her know I felt bad about her pet, but I had my own thing going on and couldn't be there for her. She insisted on calling me anyway to talk about her cat. Annoying, but my mom wasn't dead yet and my friends beloved pet was. I let it go.

Fast forward 5 months. My mother just died. I haven't been talking to my friend much because I've either been busy or exhausted. And a bit I was dodging her calls because all she ever talked about were her cats. But she wants to come to the funeral since she knew my mom and really cared for her. I let her know when and where and that she's welcome to come back to the house for the close friends and family get together after the reception.

She showed up at the church the funeral was at and I just couldn't shake her. After the service there was a reception and she followed me around it, talking to me about cats and complaining about living with her father. There were over 200 people at the service, my mom was well liked by her community. Most of them wanted to offer their condolences and as they did my friend kept awkwardly going on about her problems in the background. At one point I managed to slip away from my friend to have a smoke outside and she tracked me down. It was at that point I told her for the second time I really needed a break from the cat talk, and suggested she go say hi to her brothers family.

She came back to my side as soon as she could and continued on about the cats for the rest of the day. It was infuriating. The next day I blocked her from my social media and sent her a text saying I didn't appreciate her behavior and needed some time and space from our friendship. She flipped out, sent a lot of insulting messages, engaged with name calling. I just blocked her numbers and haven't spoken to her since.

I just wonder if I was overreacting out of grief, exhaustion, all the heaviness that comes with caring for a dying relative. AITA?"
1109,clvg6l,"WIBTA for going to management about my coworker? About 8 months ago, I befriended a new coworker named Eliza at the restaurant I work as a hostess at.

 A couple of months into Eliza working with me, I was the first one to arrive at work as I was scheduled an hour before her time to arrive. When she got there, I smiled and asked how she was doing, fully expecting her to respond like she always did with a positive answer. Instead she just glared at me and said nothing. I was confused and asked if something was wrong and again, got nothing but an angry stare. I decided to just leave her alone as she was obviously unhappy with something or someone, and I didn’t want to get involved and/or make however she was feeling worse. We ended up not speaking for the entire 4 hour shift.

 This ended up going on for TWO week’s, the stares, silence during the shift and heavy sighs whenever I would speak to her. She also began to not cooperate with me work wise. We are hosts, communication is key! The last day of the two weeks, I eventually just said “Okay, Eliza... What’s going on? I was shocked when she responded with a giggle and said “really? you don’t know why? of course!” and then she laughed again. I was feeling so defeated and got our GM involved because I couldn’t even do my job correctly, plus I just wanted my friend back. 

The GM pulled us aside and she finally told me what was wrong, and this is where things gets irrational. Eliza proceeds to explain to my manager and myself that she was working a double shift one day, and how I got sent home instead of her because of how the schedule was made. Basically she was mad at our manager for a scheduling error, and she wanted a break that was longer than an hour. But instead of going and speaking with the manager, she gets mad at me and doesn’t tell me why for TWO WEEKS. I was so tired of having an issue with a coworker that I just accepted her apology and moved on.

So about 6 months ago, I was about to leave work once Eliza got there because she was taking my spot as she was the night shift hostess and I was ending the morning shift. She came in ten minutes late, looking flustered and tired. She didn’t say hello or smile as she walked past me to clock in. I asked if she was okay and she said she was fine, just tired. Eliza sends a text that says “so you didn’t clean the windows last night. thanks alot for that, now I have to do it.” 

I respond to Eliza’s text, saying that I did clean the windows. She accused me of being a liar and lazy and just not doing my job. So I finally stood up for myself. I told her that I was tired of how she treats me, and how irrational and rude she is for no reason. I told her that I am done being her friend because I can’t deal with her attitude.

1110,aq9kdl,"AITA for wanting my bf to cut ties with his ex fling? So my bf (26) and I (23) have been dating for a little over 2 years now and there has been this one girl, C (23), who he has been friends with for 4 years. They met through work and I actually worked with her briefly before as well, before me and my bf were dating. 

Initial impression of her was that she was a little ditzy but super friendly and spiritual (as in horoscopes, crystals, tarot cards, etc.) I kind of always had a flirtatious vibe from her when it came to my boyfriend, but since she's so sweet, I figured it was just me and if I befriended her, maybe I'd see that is just her personality- or even better, she'd see her flirtatiousness bothered me and sorta just backed off out of respect. 

Well, as you can guess, that's not the case and it's only gotten worse. 

It started on my birthday. My bf and I ended my birthday night at her house because she was watching our kitty.. since it was so late, we (for some unbeknownst reason) spent the night. My boyfriend and I on her bedroom floor, her in the bed and my kitty at the foot of her bed. In the morning, my bf woke up and moved over to my kitty and cuddled with him -- ya know, what ever. But then I noticed she woke up and was just... gazing at him. She didn't see I was awake yet but she just kept looking at him with this stare that made me uncomfortable. As soon as she saw me, she jumped a little, got out of bed and offered to make breakfast.  

I pushed it aside. As i tend to do with internal conflicts. I went out to get drinks with her, just the two of us, to try and bond (which she brought her friend with her to). Then she moves to Portland- YAY! 

Then her birthday comes along and she invites my boyfriend to stay with her for a week in Oregon to visit. To be fair, I think we were both invited and planning to go ; however, something came up at work and I was unable to go. 

He still did though... and the whole time I felt super uncomfortable. But I shoved it down and kept telling myself I trust him and it'll be a quick week. This made me uncomfortable because they had previously hooked up about two months before me and my bf started dating and I had already told him she makes me feel uncomfortable with how flirtatious she is towards him.

Honestly, the week was fine. I got through my anxiety and its over with now.. but then she moved back (cue the eyeroll). 

&#x200B;

To make things quick, I'll just start listing the other things: 

1. She came over my house at 1:00am when I was sleeping because she needed to ""Vent"" to my boyfriend. He never woke me up, he informed me through a text message that I woke up to at 2:30 am -- where he still wasn't in bed yet so I knew she didn't leave much before I awoke. 
2. My boyfriend and I got into a fight. He told me he was going to ""grab a drink with a few ppl from work"" when he got off at 6. Instead, I saw on her Instagram story that they were playing pool , went bowling, an he came home around 1 am. We got into a big fight about this after and during that fight he told me that if I think he's going to stop being friends with her for me, that I'm really mistaken and he's not making me stay around. 
3. Last night we got into a stupid argument (truthfully I don't even know what about). He left the room, and about an hour later, I went into the living room and he's just chatting away on the phone with her. 

&#x200B;

That last one is really not a big deal.. but he knows that I don't like her, I don't trust her and I've had numerous times where I've expressed this to him.. I know they were friends for two years before we started dating.. but they were really just work friends besides that one time they hooked up and now she just randomly pops up. He has so many friends- guys and girls, and I just don't understand why he has to hang out with her and chat with her all the time. If they passed by each other, I'm not saying ignore her... but I just feel like their relationship isn't just friendly on her part and it really does make me uncomfortable. 

After two years, I would just think he would .. idk put my feelings first? I've tried befriending her and I just feel like she takes advantage of it and I really have this gut feeling of her bad intentions. I really don't like her and I don't know how much longer I can stand seeing/hearing her name pop around.

&#x200B;

AITA for wanting him to cut ties with her ? And what advice do ya'll have for me?

1111,c1dqei,"AITA for being annoyed at trash pickers searching collectibles and other items in our trash cans? I live in a quite So Cal beach community and over the last year we’ve had a huge increase in trash pickers, transients and homeless people digging through our trash cans. I fully understand the need for these people to collect recyclables, they’re just trying to make a buck. 
My problem is the times in which they come, the frequency, and the mess some of these pickers leave behind. Sometimes it’s a roving group of them that come at 4am, other times it’s some dude on a bike at 2pm. It’s getting pretty annoying to be woken up at 4am on a Tuesday cause some dudes left his truck running outside my window while he makes a shit ton of noise searching through our trash. There have been certain periods where anywhere from 2-5 different groups have scavenged the area in a single day. Aside for that, some have been ripping open standard trash bags and dumping the contents in the trash cans. Like, we use trash bags in part to control the odor, but now our trash area just smells like rotting food all the time. I’m trying to be understanding and patient, but it’s getting harder for me. Especially when my neighbors and I are left to clean up the mess these people leave behind. So, AITA?

Edit : I live in a condo complex and certain suggestions like locking the bins or putting the trash out on the day of pick up aren't feasible. Thanks though!"
1112,c9n304,"AITA for tossing my neighbors fireworks debris back onto their property? Each year on July 4th, my neighbors enjoy (illegally) setting of fireworks on the street. Apparently their 70-foot-wide lot is not large enough and they also like to set them off in front of my home. 

This morning, the wife and I woke up to red dust and shells scattered across our new paver driveway and front lawn. While maintaining my property is my duty, I don’t feel i should be forced to clean up after them. And since I’m already forced into sweeping and scrubbing my driveway to clean the dust, I tossed whatever fireworks debris I found back onto their property."
1113,d75pn7,"AITA? My roommate wanted to borrow my vacuum but I wouldn't let him. So to preface I've been living with this guy for about 3 years now and while he's probably one of the nicest guys you'll meet but he's also the most disgusting human I've had the displeasure of living with. In the entire three years we've lived together he has maybe cleaned 2-3 times and it's only been when he's had family over. This includes leaving pots out till they get mold, leaving 15-20 2L bottles of pop on the kitchen counters (he drinks 2-3 of these a day and I only clean them every 1-2 weeks because it's annoying), puking in a sink and not clean it while I was away at work for over a 3-4 days (has happened 3 times now), piling trash next to the trash can when it gets full and just other lazy things.

So today he asked if he could borrow my vacuum to vacuum in the business he owns that's directly below our apartment. Now he's used it before without my permission when I use to leave it in the storage area near the living room and would always return it with the cord in a tangled mess not even wrapped up (this takes maybe 10 seconds as it has a spot on the side that wraps it up quickly for you) and never empty's it out (again it's one of those Dyson that detaches easily and takes nothing to empty it out in the garbage outside). I spoke with him multiple times after this happened and asked him to at least empty it out before he brings it back upstairs and he always apologizes and says he will next time but never does. So after a couple times of this happening I have since moved it in my room since he doesn't bother to use it in our own apartment anyways and hoping to avoid conflict. So when he texted me today I simply responded with a no hoping that would be that but he got pissy and kept asking why I wouldn't let him use it since I was ""more than happy to let him use it before"".  I sent him ""Well since you want to know so badly 1. You used it without my permission those other times and returned it completely full and the cord in a mess 2. You literally never clean up in OUR OWN APARTMENT and I'm sick of having to clean up after you and you using my items to clean something that I have no association with 3. It's not a commercial vacuum and I'm not going to pay for a new one once this one breaks because you vacuum dry wall with it and we both know you won't pay for a replacement"". 

Since then he has avoided me like the plague after getting off work tonight and his business partner sent me a text saying I was an asshole and just should have let him use the vacuum to clean up after a customer since I've ""let"" him before. AITA for not allowing him to use the vacuum for a business I have no association with and since he doesn't even clean our own apartment?"
1114,csb23u,"WIBTA For Leaving My Cousins Wedding Early? A bit of a backstory. I'm writing my MCAT this summer (gruelling exam, spent all my free time not at work studying in the library all summer).  Pretty much axed social life for this exam. I go back to school (as do all my friends, none of whom go to school in the same province as me) on September 2nd. My MCAT is on August 29th (Thursday). Two of my very good friends from High School are throwing birthday parties on the Friday and then the Sunday night before going back to school for the year.  If this wedding was a one or even two day event, I'd suck it up. But the wedding is a 4 day event  from Thursday to Sunday (customary for most Indian weddings); to compromise, I told my mum I'd go to each of the 4 days, spend 3 of my entire nights there and on one night leave ""early"" (9-9:30pm ish) as opposed to around 11 or whenever the night ends and go see my friends. Of course on the night of the actual ceremony (the Sunday) I'd stay for the whole night. She freaked out and said I don't care about family enough and is insanely mad that I would even dare to consider leaving any part of the wedding early. The thing is, I'm not even that close to this cousin, it's my one weekend of ""freedom"" between the MCAT and school and the only chance to see some of my friends for an entire year until next summer. I'm a young adult and I'm aware of the fact that I can just do what I want but I'm curious as to whether or not I'm in the wrong. WIBTA?"
1115,by0x62,"AITA for getting annoyed at my mom So my wife and I just had our first child, which is my mom’s first grandchild and my sisters’ first nephew.  My wife and I live 6 hours away from both of our families.  My mother is a widow, and my sisters are both older than me and single.  These three are pretty much a package deal, you want to see one, you usually get all 3.  They all love our son, which is fantastic and my wife and I love that they do.

A few weeks ago, we were all together at sister 1s house, and my mother asked for a weekend in June that she could come see us (meaning the baby).  I told her I’d look into it and let her know.  Last week, my wife and I decided that the weekend of June 30 would be great; it’s our wedding anniversary and this would allow us to go to dinner alone to celebrate.  Mom said she and sister 2 would come either Friday or Saturday morning, which I said sounds great.

Today, she tells me that she has to work on Friday, and that they’d be coming on Saturday morning instead.  She said their plan was to drive to sister 1s house on Friday, which is halfway to us, and all 3 come on Saturday morning.  Here is where the potential AITA comes in.  I said to her, “so all 3 of you are coming now.   It would be nice to be asked sometimes if that is fine, we were only planning on you and sister 2.”.  Mom proceeds go to lose it on me, saying how sister 1 always drops stuff to help me however she can (this is true).  I told her I’m sorry if I came across rude or ungrateful, it’s just annoying to have it be assumed that we want all 3 at the same time all the time (this has happened a few time).  She gets off the phone with me shortly thereafter and now I’m sitting here feeling awful that I’ve just been super hurtful to my mom, but I can’t decide if I should feel bad or if I’m slightly in the right.

I’ve already apologized profusely, so this post is more for my own feelings than wether I should call and apologize.

1116,a4za6x,"AITA for kicking my grandma out of my house? My grandma is just not a good person. She is an addict with many vices, alcohol and gambling are the to main ones. When my mom was a kid my grandma would get drunk and be both verbally and physically abusive. Shortly after my mom turned 18 my grandma went to prison. She claimed to clean up her act and my mom forgave her and started sending her money. When I was a teen she spent the night at our place one night because she had no where else to go. While I am at school and my mom is at work she steals my life saving that I earned that summer working and she steals all of my moms jewelry. We later find out that she has stolen from just about everyone in the family as soon as they let her in. And she goes back to jail for theft.

She claims to have cleaned up her act again and my whole family has seemed to forgiven her. I haven't and I won't. I have zero respect for someone who will lie, steal, and beat their own family (especially their own child).

So this year since it is the first year that I have my own place I wanted to throw a Christmas party for my family. Someone invited her without my knowledge and when she shows up and flip out and kick her the hell out of my house.

This pretty much ended the party. It was very awkward and quite after that. And many of my family thinks that I should have put all that aside for family and that I should have been more mature and let things go.

So am I an asshole for kicking my grandma out and by extent ruining the family Christmas party?"
1117,afurnp,"AITA for wanting to repossess my Blendtec/tv from my room mates? I am moving out of my house this week. I lived here two years ago, left for a year and came back. I forgot a few things in the house including a tv my mom gave me and my Blendtec blender. By Washington state law, the property became their because I technically abandoned it the first time I left. 
This time, I want to take these things with me but legally it’s their property. On the other hand, I have receipts for the blender ($425) and pictures of the tv in my old home from years ago. They told me I could take them at departure when I moved back in, but the climate has changed in the house. I’m nervous to ask them because they are on hard drugs and don’t remember what happened 20 minutes ago, so I wouldn’t expect them to remember something they said 2 months ago. 

AITA for wanting my things back? I plan to leave them my juicer which they love (also have $200 receipt) and my grow equipment which totals around $500- I left those here a while ago also.

1118,d0yyjb,"AITA Swim lesson Confrontation 1st post, so I'm sorry if I'm doing it wrong.

My kids take swim lessons and when they finish up, we change them in stalls. There is only one handicapped/family sized stall. Per policy posted on the stalls, they cannot be reserved. 

My husband and I gathered our two kids who swim after getting reports from their coaches. We also have a newborn who we keep in a stroller. We headed to the family stall so I could bring in the stroller and help my husband change our 2 and 4 year olds. The stall had bags in the stall. Husband tells me to just move them. We had no way of knowing when and if person would return.

Of course as I place them outside, a parent comes up and says, ""That's our stuff.""

I'm pretty sure I said, ""I'm sorry,"" with a shrug.

Other Parent - "" I just put them in there for two minutes to go get my kids.""

Me - ""You're not supposed to do that.""

Other Parent - ""Well I have three kids to change."" She grabs stuff and walks off.

We changed our kids and went about our business. She continued with passive aggressive comments at desk as we were trying to schedule new lessons. As we were leaving I overheard her ask about their policy. 

Am I a jerk for moving the bags or should we have waited for her to return? 

My reaction is to think that she was reserving the changing room before anyone else could get there. Her comment about needing to change 3 kids seems like she feels they were more important than other families. I totally understand why she wanted the stall, but if we had gotten there and saw it occupied, we would have either waited or worked with the smaller stalls.

Confrontation gives me hives. This happened hours ago and I'm still dwelling."
1119,ex1ymz,"AITA for forbidding my sister to use my computer? I (M14) want to clarify that she's (F18) still allowed to use the PC if needed because of her college or job.

Context: parents divorced, I've came to live with mom, sis also lives with mom. When in the subject of where to build my PC, sister suggested and insisted that the PC should stay in her bedroom, since there already was a table (no table in my room).

For the past few days I've been hearing her talk over discord and hearing my high pitched keyboard over her door during all night. I can't sleep properly, her voice is annoying and the keyboard sound triggers me.

Today, after she kicked me out of her room during a game that I said to her that I would quit as soon as I could, not waiting me to end it, I went to bed and heard her playing. This infuriated me.

 I knocked, the door was locked, she asked me ""super politely"":

Sis: What do you want?

Me: I want to talk with you. - I heard she going to the door to unlock it 

Sis: What do you want? - She asks again while unlocking the door 

Then, with the door slightly open, the conversation goes as something along this lines:

Me: I've heard you using the computer, and I came here to ask you, this keyboard is mine, so as the entire computer, I want it.

Sis: You're insane, that's absurd, let's be reasonable, I'm playing and I can't quit now.

Me: You made me quit during a game. The keyboard is mine, you've been using it during late night and I've been hearing it.

Sis: there's no way that you could hear from you room, blah blah blah, some nonsense bullshit about how she's right and I'm being unfair.

Me: Ok, but the keyboard is mine and I want it.

She saw that I was going to open the door and enter the room, she closed it with full power. Over the door she screamed that she would give it to me once her match was finished. 

Since she made me quit during my game, I went to the router and disconnected the RJ45.

She then screams:

Sis: I don't believe that you've did it, holy shit that's childish, blah blah blah... I want it out of my room. RIGHT NOW!

Me: With pleasure
 
Once I finished moving the machine, she closed the door enraged. Over the door she says that she doesn't want me to enter HER room anymore.

I answer that I don't want her to use MY computer, if not to do something related to college or her job.

You guys know that I'm 14yo and you guys also know that I didn't buy the PC, since I can't work yet. Everything on this build was a gift from my dad to ME. My peripherals were all gifts to ME.

Couple weeks ago, after a fight about who was the computer owner, I asked my dad, he said that it's up to my mom. Asked mom, she said that the PC was mine.

So, am I the asshole™ for abolishing my sister's right to use my computer for recreation?

1120,ctgykc,"AITA for not wanting a new office chair if I can't take my old one home? Whole office was offered new chairs, I asked about the specs on the new chairs and they seemed pretty basic so I declined because I was one of the lucky few able to nab a really fancy one from a different office when we merged. It's one of the ones with like 10 different nobs and levers to get everything perfect.   


So, they asked me to help assemble all these new chairs (like 20+) when they were delivered and they were telling everyone that if they got a new chair they could take their old one home.  


One of the ladies in our office did not like the new chair once she sat in it so she opted to keep her original chair (it was not a fancy one, just wider). They offered this new chair to any of us that had not switched, nobody wanted it so I sat in it and it was quite comfortable right out of the box and did not need any adjustment. So I took it, it wasn't really any better than my other chair but the fact that I could take the other chair home was enough of a selling point to use the new chair.  


Now, my office mate across the hall (Who has the same fancy chair already and also declined the new chairs) saw me wheeling the fancy chair into the corner of my office & decides they want my fancy chair because the color is different... (hers is more of a beige while mine was black). I told her that was fine, I'll just take the beige one home... I'm sure you see where this is going.  


She says we were allowed to take ""our old chairs home"" and the beige one is her old chair so she will be taking it home herself... So I said nevermind, I'll just keep my chair and someone else can take the new one; she doesn't want it even if she can take the beige one home.

My husband asked for a hug and my son said no. My husband sat on the floor and put his head in his hands. I hustled my son into his room and as I asked if he wanted tucked in my husband made sad sounds.

I closed the door and then told my husband that what he was doing was emotionally manipulating our son and that it was not ok.   I said that son was allowed to not give hugs and kisses.  I said that son is not responsible for husband's emotions. Husband said that son can choose not to give hugs and kisses but that he was affecting husband and that husband would have reactions to this.

I repeated again that husband was emotionally manipulating son and that it was not ok. Husband told me that I was emotionally manipulating husband by trying to change him. I walked away.

We were extremely close in our college days. She was my ride or die best friend.  I was a bridesmaid in her wedding, she was one in mine to my ex husband. We threw each other bridal and baby showers. We are both in our 30’s with small children now.

Several years into our friendship Jennifer became friends with a girl we’ll call Holly. I had always really liked Holly. She and I never hung out alone, but we were frequently together as a group. 

I went through a very contentious divorce 5 years ago. It was very hard on me. Both Jennifer and Holly saw me cry over it. 

I’m happily remarried now with a soon to be toddler. I have also recently acquired some serious health issues. I haven’t seen any of my friends that much lately because i am frequently in the hospital, live farther away from them, have a toddler, and have a full time job. 

Well today I saw pictures on social media from Jennifer’s bday party last night. I knew nothing about it. Also, my ex husband is in the pictures. That’s odd because Jennifer was not friends with him. She only knew him because of our marriage. 

Then for some reason my mom (who is an asshole, but probably had good intentions to defend me) texts Jennifer to call her out, and Jennifer admits to me that Holly is dating my ex husband.. and has been for some time. Apparently Holly planned the party and told Jennifer that she did invite me, and that I just never answered her. Jennifer doesn’t believe Holly would lie to her about that. Well guess what.... she didn’t say a word to me. I even saw her 4 days ago. Nothing. 

Both of these girls had ample opportunities to be honest with me. It may have been a little awkward at first, but I wouldn’t have cared!!!! I liked Holly. I am happily married. I hold no more ill will towards my ex. 

I feel like a good friend would have told me about this months ago. I’ve been around all of them multiple times where I guess they just pretended not to be together. Jennifer has apologized that I was left out of the party, but I think she’s missing (or choosing to ignore) the point.

1123,eq7ba4,"WIBTA If I stopped hanging out with my friend because he owes everyone money? So my good friend I’ll call Tom to keep my privacy from my home hometown has owed my best friend money for over a year now. He borrowed some money to pay for Uni (we both go to the same school). He was given over $1000. For a year now, my best friend has been very lenient and has pushed back the due date multiple times. Each time my friend was supposed to pay him back the money, Tom gave an excuse and asked to move the payback date to a day where a large sum of money was coming in for him. Each push back date, no money came in. 

I have done my absolute best to keep my nose out of the situation throughout the year but honestly it keeps getting thrown on my lap. Last night my other friend called me and asked me if Tom was okay, because Tom apparently borrowed $100 from him and was supposed to pay him back yesterday. Well he didn’t. Tom apparently called and asked my other friend’s PARENTS and told them that Tom’s parents weren’t helping him out and that he needed money.  It’s an absolute lie. His parents have given him tons of money this year literally every time he asks. 

Then I find out he owes 2 other of my mutual friends money. It’s seriously getting out of hand. For a year and a half he has borrowed money he doesn’t pay back. 

My best friend told me he is going to confront Tom and try to work with him one last time. He said if the money isn’t come up with, he’ll cut ties with him and inform our friend group of the situation all together. 

Even though he doesn’t owe me money, I still feel like I’m obligated to be mad at Tom because he’s fucked all of my friends over with money. So if I stopped hanging out with him if he doesn’t pay back his money, would I be a bad friend? He’s never wronged me, but I feel like it would reflect poorly on me.

We were very young, the wedding was super casual, and was planned in a matter of weeks. I had planned to make sandwiches to serve but my in laws wouldn’t hear of it. They insisted we have it catered even though we were broke. My FIL said he got a great deal (he’s always getting deals because he’s a smooth talker) from a neighbor on barbecue that we could afford the day before the wedding. Everyone seemed to care so much so I went along with it and scrapped my plans. 
At the wedding the food is great but the bill ends up being almost quadruple what my FIL told us it would be and we just didn’t have it. Without us asking FIL stepped in and covered it as our wedding gift. We were very grateful. 

When the evening was wrapping up there were plenty of leftovers so I offered them to a friend who I knew was literally struggling to put food on the table. She was thrilled. It didn’t seem like a big deal until we got back from the honeymoon a couple days later and it turns out FIL is livid that we have given “his” food away. He said he spent all his money on the barbecue and had to go hungry all weekend (confirmed to be a total exaggeration by my MIL) when he could have been eating the barbecue.

Anyway since i dont care for football i spend most of my time hanging out by the makeshift bar and snack stand and an employees wife is with me. We hit it off joking about our lack of football knowledge and just generally joke throughout the night.

A couple hours in and we've both had a lot of drinks. 

""So you came alone?"" She says. I told her this before early on.

""Yes ma'am.""

""Not completely alone."" 

At this point she forcefully grabs my crotch. I am shocked and sort of have a nervous laugh reaction which might have encouraged her as when i put my hand on her wrist to push her away gently she started ""groping"" me through my pants.

At this point the following exchange happens.

""Haha, whaaaat?"" I push her off me in a playfull way.

""Haha sorry."" She replies

""Nah its okay I just need to go to the bathroom""

I then walk away and dont speak to her the rest of the party. At least until the end and we're all walking out and shes hammered. She calls me over to her as im walking out and kisses my cheek while putting her phone number in my hand.

I just say bye i had a nice time and i leave.

I have sort of resolved never to speak of this again but im joking with my best friend about it and he says i should tell my subordinate. I dont have any real relationship with my subordinate so it would be awkward. I also think, maybe if I did text her it wouldn't be such a bad thing? Like maybe they have an open relationship? Idk im kinda hung over right now.

What do you guys believe."
1128,aspjit,"WIBTA for writing and sending a letter to estranged family member? I have not spoken to my mother in 2.5 years. Other members of the family have approached me stating she wants to have a relationship with me but this is not possible because she has not ever apologized to me for her wrongdoings. She treats me like I'm her therapist, always venting about things that have happened in the past. When I disagree with her, she claims I'm incorrect or invalidates my feelings.

&#x200B;

Backstory:

Mother is doing drugs

Mother leaves me in the hospital to continue drugs

I don't know at which point she tried to regain custody but according to my grandmother, she didn't know where I was until I was 8. 

Mother does not know who father is and lied to me about this. 

Mother belittles me, calls me names

Mother consistently complained to me about childhood. These are legitimate complaints but I am not equipped to address them because I am not a licensed mental health counselor. 

&#x200B;

I'm not convinced she's ignorant of what she's doing but rather is doing so out of malice. She has been this way ever since I met her (\~age 12?). If I write and send this letter, it would point out all of the above in great detail and informing her never to speak to me again. She has not contacted me since July 2016. "

My dad always gets the mail from the mailbox when he gets home from work and on multiple occasions he has opened mail addressed to me before I even get to see it. The one that got to me the most was I got a rejection letter for a scholarship I applied for and he just opened it and then talked to me how I should’ve worked harder to get it.

1130,bm7srl,"AITA for telling my boyfriend he is being silly, and that I won't turn up at a friend's house unannounced, straight after our last uni deadline? Pretty much as the title says, my BF has it in his head he wants to go and ""pop in"" to our friends house at 3pm tomorrow. 

3pm is the cut off for our very last (3rd year) deadline, and knowing the friend in question, (we'll call him E), E has probably been stressing and not sleeping. He is useless at communicating but he isn't one for people just turning up at his house. I think it is a bad idea, because he will either be A) extremely cranky and stressed, or B) asleep when we turn up. 

Personally, I wouldn't appreciate someone turning up without a heads up after I've been stressing, but my BF doesn't want to message him in advance to essentially, (in my opinion) not give him the opportunity to say no to us coming over. 

I told the BF that I wouldn't go with him if he went unannounced, and that I think its mean to just turn up tomorrow of all days. He got huffy and said that ""in his family it's a nice thing to do"".

Nobody besides her is supposed to live there, but she's taking care of one of her granddaughters due to negligent parents, and she's worried she'll get in trouble if the cops are contacted. 

I want to file a police report because there has easily been ~$300 in damage to my car (probably more), and also this little fuck next door should see consequences for damaging other people's property.

1132,e8qk9g,"AITA for objecting to my Girlfriends plans to meet up with an Old Flame? A few weeks ago, my Girlfriends old boyfriend who ghosted on her almost 10 years ago sent her a message out of the blue. According to her, they secretly talked for days before she had what she calls, ""a lapse in judgement"", and sent him lewd pictures and 'sexted' while reminiscing. She felt guilty and told me about it which resulted in a long argument. 

Days later, I came to find out that she secretly planned to meet up with him while visiting her Mother in her hometown that's several hours drive away. She only told me of this after I offered to come with her because I was unsure if I was able to get time off from work. In my eyes, she has two strikes against her in the matter, but after lengthy talking, she insists that she needs to talk to him face to face (instead of over the phone) to figure out why he did what he did and ""close the door"" on that part of her life. However, instead of meeting him in a public place or over coffee. He wanted to pick her up and take her back to his place..to which she COMPLETELY complied with. ( later knowing that he lives with his mother and daughter who she was very close to) and also wants to see them.

Am I The Asshole for strongly objecting to any of this situation taking place? She has said that I'm being immature and would be fully supportive if I wanted to squash an old flame issue.

1133,9zkw5r,"AITA for telling my 92 year old Grandma her life investment is essentially worthless? Backstory: I’m 24 yr old male taking care of my grandma because I’m all the family she has. My tiny, innocent grandmother (92yr) has been taken advantage of by people on the internet many times. One of the worst and consequently final straws was about 2 years ago, when I gave her $500 to help pay for her utilities and a few other necessities for a couple months. Within a week it was gone and sent to “some nice Nigerian investors.” We never saw it again, and she had to live in a motel for a few weeks until I could figure out something else. 

The reason she is so gullible on the internet is because she retired way to early. Now unfortunately she’s got nothing left & has severe scoliosis which she can’t afford treatment for. All of these scams she falls for is cause she desperate for hope.. hope that her life will get back to how it was when she was working insurance making 6 figures. 

Ever since the scam where she threw away $500 she has been pretty good. 
I explained as calmly, politely and sternly as I could. Unfortunately though it looks like it happened again. This time though it’s been about 20-30 years in the making. Apparently she purchased around 
2 million Vietnamese dollars from some people on the internet. She thought that it would grow in value.. but also that each Vietnamese dollar was worth 3 u.s dollars. I honestly don’t know how she ever thought that made sense... 
but oh well. She kept pleading with me to take her to the bank to cash in “our million dollar ticket.” Honestly though I have no idea how to even exchange currency or where exactly to do it. So instead I showed her on my phone the current exchange rate.. big mistake. I’ve never seen my tiny, innocent Grandma act so distraught. She started to break down and cry, even getting upset at me a for breaking the news to her. 

I’m back home now, and I feel pretty bad. I can’t help but think there was a better way for me to handle this. She has said things that make my heart ache for her, like “I wish life could just be over” and other really depressing things. Maybe I should have let her continue to have that hope that there’s a better future on the horizon. She’s in so much pain, I know the only thing keeping her going is some sort of improvement in her life, and that’s why she is so desperate for these monetary miracles to happen. "

1135,c87313,"AITA for talking to women after my cousin already tried to flirt with them? OK about 95% of girls I used to talk to over social medias all have similar story on how they've already had my cousin message/inbox them before I started talking to them. 

Most girls often said that he would add them out of the blue, he would message them first and try to spark convo with them, and usually within the first couple of days or weeks, they would all say he came off really hard, like he falls in love with them, announcing he loves them, despite actually meeting one another. 

All of the stories usually end the same with the girls declining him and he would usually self destruct the relationship he was trying to construct with them, some times him responding with abusive messages towards them. 
Some girls even declined him because he was running the same the game with the girls friend, sister or cousin. (while in the company of each other) 

Him being my cousin, he lived with us for just over a year, so I had some sort of idea on which girls he was talking to (I never interfered with the girls he was actively talking to) , and me being the main cousin he would hang around, I would generally be in most of his social media page, and because of him adding up to 10 different girls a day while trying to run his game with them, it was no surprise a few of the girls would add me too, since I'd be the other dude he would post about.

Everytime a new girl would add or message me, I always asked him ""do you know this girl?"",
And 9/10 he would know and often replied with ""yeah I tried talking to her but yadayah yadayah ect"" 

Most of the girls I did date said they all have a bad taste for my cousin because of the way how he used to message them before talking to me, and at some moment it sort of seemed a bit awkward, but not enough to bother us to an uncomfortable level. 

Even with my partner I am with today and who I shared a child with, openly says that she doesn't like my cousin because of the same reasons.
But at least both parties can be mature about it and not let it get in between the relationship I have with both my partner and my cousin.

1137,bch4y2,"AITA for not wanting to lose half a vacation day without warning? So my co-workers and boss are super nice and cool people, but they get strange and defensive when it comes to salary negotiations, writing down what my benefits are, and writing down policies such as ""vacation time"" and ""proper security procedures"".  The work itself isn't too hard, but there's tons of it, and I frequently work 10-12 hours a day (no OT, salaried, weeee) trying to keep from drowning in it.

Last year, I took a vacation - the 18th and 19th of October.  I asked for the vacation time, got it, and used those days.  I asked (verbally, my mistake) if it was okay if I came in at 6 and left at 3 (I usually work from 8 to 5) so I could catch a flight at 5, and they cleared it.   I came in at 6, worked alone until people started coming in at 9, worked with people from 9 to 3, then left for my flight.

I asked today how many vacation days I had left - 7.5.  Thought I only used 2?  Well, apparently, since I left early, they decided to take half a vacation day from me - despite clear (sadly verbal, don't make this mistake!) confirmation that it was fine for me to work early and leave early, and absolutely no notice from them that I'd be consuming half a vacation day to do so.    I would never have scheduled my flight for 5 had I known I'd have to eat half a vacation day to do so - I had available flights at 6:50 and 8:10 that I could've easily made.  

So I asked them for my half-vacation day back.  I stated I worked a full day that day - ""We don't have timestamp software, so I can only really go by what I wrote down.""  The servers track when people connect and disconnect, you can look at that and see when I started and ended work that day - ""I don't know how to view server logs, so no"".  Of course, it's the incredibly non-tech-savvy boss that's reviewing this.  But what the hell?  And then they get mad at me, saying ""You aren't allowed to question what we dock from you, please don't bring it up again, everyone else understands this policy (that has never been mentioned to me before, and was not written on any contracts I signed or anywhere else I've ever seen), it was in your terms of appointment (spoiler: it wasn't, but the boss mysteriously can't find time to sit down and go over my contract with me)"" and so on.    

Even assuming I couldn't prove that I worked a full 8 hours that day, I am a salaried employee, and I have consistent and frequent proof of working 10-12 hour days, so it feels really petty and shitty to dock me half a day's pay in benefits effectively for something that I only agreed to because they said it was okay.  Am I really an asshole for wanting that half day back, to the point that (and I haven't threatened or told them this, but) I'm willing to just stop working past 8 hours a day and allow the work I'm not capable of finishing in 8 hours to slip?  I like these people as people otherwise, but this just seems like such an out-of-the-blue dick move, and I'm furious. :("
1138,bnpgps,"AITA for not letting my bf borrow my car for the day? My boyfriend would like to borrow my car for a day while his new car is getting detailed. He said he needs it for one day and probably will just sit in a lot for much of the day while he works.

My problem comes from that fact that I don’t like the way he has driven in the past. Recently we only had the one car (mine) and I let him drive it and drop me off at work then pick me up after. Normally he’s good about getting me on time but sometimes I have to wait, and it’s embarrassing for my co workers to see me waiting. While that’s an inconvenience, that’s not the main reason why I don’t want to let him borrow the car.

I think he drives like an ass. Too fast sometimes dodging in and out of traffic, he’s driven on shoulders before and will ride the turning lane until he sees an opening and ducks back into traffic. He’s also a hot head and has yelled at people and gotten out of the vehicle before. He’s not always like this but it seems more often than not.

He doesn’t have the most disposable income and if I don’t let him borrow the car he’ll have to call an Uber or some such....

Am I an asshole for telling him I don’t want him to borrow my car even though I let him use it for months before he got his own car?

Yes I have voiced before I think he should drive slower. I have called him an ass before about reckless driving but he scoffed at me.

1139,abl8fb,"AITA for ruining my family's New Years dinner? TL;DR - We had a family cookout for New Years and invited our cousins. We had a religious debate during the dinner and it turned into a heated argument because of me being atheist. I got up and left, and no one said anything after that.

As the title suggests, I pretty much ruined my family's dinner over a religious debate. Before I explain, you can believe in what you want to believe and I respect that, and I am in no way meaning to start a debate on this post.

I come from a very religious family; however, I am atheist, and have been for quite some time. My family understands that I am atheist, and even though they don't like the idea, they respect my decision because I am old enough to make decisions. However, my aunts and uncles have never respected my decision, and have always chastised me every time we talk. I usually take what they say, ignore it, and move on, but just recently I ""snapped.""

We were having a cookout for New Years, eating dinner and spending time together like a normal family. We started with a prayer, I did not engage in the prayer and received dirty looks from my aunts and uncles, but no one said anything. Our family ate and talked about various topics like the usual, but then my uncle started targeting me and my decision on being atheist. He talked like he usually did, but as usual I just nodded and ignored it. I guess he must have gotten mad because he looked at my parents and said, ""How could you raise such an ignorant child? He has no idea what he's talking about!""

At that point, I felt disrespected, and angry towards him because he didn't respect me, and he questioned my parents and the way they raised me. At this point, I started talking back, and questioning why he believes religion. We were having a sort of ""civil"" discourse and as we continued everyone started ganging up against me. Soon it went from being civil and a regular debate, to everyone calling me idiotic, ignorant, naive, immature, etc. As much as I was trying to ignore everything, I was fumed and I repeatedly kept questioning their beliefs. At this point I was very angry at everyone, minus my parents (thankfully they are understanding and didn't say a word) and I got up and left before it got worse.

I later got a text from my cousins saying that after I left, no one said anything and after they finished eating, everyone went home. Is there a different way I could have handled this situation? Or should I talk to my aunts and uncles and talk to them specifically?

My boyfriend and I dated for almost a year and then he broke up with me and had sex with someone the day after, the girl he slept with has the exact same name as me. I took this as a stab in the gut, especially because her name was changed to ""Elsie The Best"" in his contacts.

This obviously hurt me a lot at the time and every now and then when I think back to it, it hurts again. Although we were broken up, it felt like he had cheated and it felt like he was intentionally trying to hurt me.

Flash forward a year later (now) and he and I have gotten back together, everything was going well until he told me he still hangs out with the girl he slept with because they like to sing together at a bar. This upset me and I asked him to not hangout with her anymore.

He says I'm being unreasonable because 'she's just a friend' and 'he's not going to cheat on me. ' He told me to trust him but although I do, the problem isn't just the fear that they might sleep together. It's also about keeping her in his life after her actions have caused me so much pain, the thought of it just doesn't rest well with me.

1141,bqm684,"AITA for not finishing a chore? Hi reddit - throwaway since my husband knows my account.

My husband came home from work after working 8 hours on the weekend (6am - 2pm). For context, he works 6/7 days while I have a normal M-F 9-5 job. I know he works hard so we have an agreement that I walk the dogs most mornings and about 70-80% of the time at night too. It’s an hour each walk - so two hours total.

Anyways, I’m about 3.5 months pregnant and this morning I woke up and walked out dogs for about 45 minutes instead of the normal hour because I was having some back pain. I went home and rested my back and did some chores at home (light cleaning, dishes, and made lunch for my husband and myself). When he gets home he asked if I had walked the dogs, and I tell him “yes, but only for about 45 minutes because my back started hurting.” 

Well, he got EXTREMELY pissed, yelling that he just wanted to come home and relax and not worry about having to walk them after a full day of work, etc. I told him that I can take them back out and walk them while he relaxes but this pissed him off more, with him yelling that “you KNOW I don’t stay at home while you walk the dogs. Of course I would walk them with you so you’re just making me do more work”.

I got extremely upset because I felt like 15 minutes difference wasn’t that terrible and I was planning on making up the 15 minutes later on anyways during the second walk. I started crying because it stressed me out how much he was yelling and went to go be by myself for a while to calm down.

Instead, he took the dogs himself and now I’m wondering - am I the asshole here? I really wasn’t trying to make him do the second walk, just needed a second to let my back rest but now idk. Maybe I should have just finished it?

For context, back pain is a new issue and not something that I’ve used to skimp on walking out dogs before.

1142,arzotl,"AITA for telling pretty girl to figure her life out before moving to New York City to fail as a dancer. Let’s call her Prudence. Not so long ago, Prudence decided that we were a couple, romantically entangled and in love despite the fact that I’d never taken Prudence on a date, expressed interest beyond wanting someone to dance with and she’s arguably attractive, and me unattached. 

I wasn’t excited about the news that I was suddenly dating but I didn’t really do anything to quash it as I live 45 minutes away and in my experience these things tend to work themselves out with distance and no communication and medication. 

Time goes by and Prudence won’t let it go that we’re a couple. I start to show up places and there she is. It gets weird because I’m going places to get my dance on (think ballroom and latin) and she’s showing up and making it clear that I’m taken. 

I try to let her know I’m not interested and she storms off of dance floors crying and making a scene. It got to the point where mutual friends started telling me to knock it off. She was fine and I was the problem.

Thing is, I don’t consider myself now nor ever an attractive person. I’m not a skilled dancer though I did take classes and I could lead, and this was my way of relaxing. 

Also, Prudence just wasn’t my type, which is one of those weird conundrums guys go through when a pretty girl is involved and the Barney Stinson Hot-Crazy chart is in play, which can lead to all kinds of possibilities. I can’t change who I am and Prudence couldn’t be someone else and yeah. 

Anyway, I agree to dance with her after she’s had a bad day, not caused by me, and during the slow pace around the dance floor she tells me she’s going to move away. Actually, she said, “Everything will be so much better when I move to New York City.”

Stupidly, I asked why she was moving and Prudence decided to tell me about all the shitty things going on in her life. Up until this moment, I didn’t know she had ever spent a night let alone a stint in a psychiatric facility nor did I give one thought to a potentially bad home life. 

I’m a good enough listener to commiserate with her and even though I don’t believe people need to be told to figure their shit out before moving to a different state and city, or before running away from whatever, it was taking all I had to not tell her to NOT run away from her problems. 

Then she said, “I’m going to New York to be a professional dancer.” She wanted to dance in musicals on Broadway, un-ironically. 

Prudence had two left feet and while I’m in no way an inspired dancer, she was just plain bad, horrible. So, I say, “Maybe, before you move to New York, you figure out some of the problems you have here. You can’t run away from them and problems have a tendency to follow you.” 

Apparently, that was the wrong thing to say. She ran off the dance floor and out of the building screaming and in hysterics and I was  very quickly and less-than-politely requested to please find other people with whom to associate and other venues through which I could get my formal dance on. "

I would understand if it was a household rule, but they still have sweets in the house and everyone else is allowed to eat except for me. When I try to eat some they get mad at me. 

I get that it’s ‘their house, their rules’ or whatever. But if it’s for health reasons shouldn’t everyone stop eating junk food not just me? My parents ngl are heavy + my brother is on the wrestling team. So I feel like it’s a double standard of sorts.

I feel very frustrated with this and snapped at my brother because he was exaggerating eating ice cream. Then I raised my voice saying the rule was dumb and went to my room. I was grounded which I expected since I raised my voice, but everyday I feel more and more upset because i’m surrounded by food I can’t eat.

My dad also keeps sending me articles about what foods I can’t eat because they aren’t good for you and it’s always food that I like. I can’t even eat cereal anymore.

I told this to my friends and they said my parents are being dumb, but they’re probably biased lol.

info: cant buy my own snacks bc i have no job, not allowed to get one as school is my ‘job’. my parents have control over my debit card and would probs notice if i bought something with it

AITA for thinking this rule is dumb and wanting it to change. Or are my parents really trying to help me in a way I can’t see?

I will talk to them about this soon and see if we can go to the doctors or whoever and see if I actually need a diet change. If they refuse then I will talk to someone at school about it.

1144,e5cyq1,"AITA For cutting off my grandparents? TDLR at the bottom

First off I want to establish a few things: I’m 16 and have been out to my family as a trans man for about a year now (if you don’t know what that means, basically I have transitioned from my birth gender to being male). We told my extended family a month or so ago and all took it very well except my grandparents.

I’m treated just like a cis guy in all other aspects of my life. My teachers call me He/him and my chosen name, I sign all my school work with my name, all my friends at school use the correct name and pronouns, and so do my aunts, uncles, and cousins. It’s just one set of grandparents. 

 Shocker, they’re very religious. We were hoping they would be quietly judgmental, at least that’s easy to deal with, but they essentially said “we won’t respect your name or pronouns unless we’re in public” and 99% of the time I see them we’re in private. I know they older, from another generation and don’t understand, but it hurt me a lot when I found out they said that. I felt like I was rather close to my grandfather and I genuinely loved visiting them, but I can’t handle this.

After they responded the way they did, my parents let me decide what to do. They didn’t want to make decisions for me and thought I was mature enough to decide for myself how to deal with it. What we settled on was essentially until they start respecting me they’re out of our lives entirely. We didn’t visit for thanksgiving and aren’t planning on it for Christmas, and they’re officially uninvited from all the other family stuff from us. 

I don’t know if that was the right choice. I feel like it might be too much and I feel really guilty. I used to text my grandma fairly frequently but now we don’t text at all and it’s straining the relationship with my cousins because we aren’t seeing each other as much. I’m not even sure if it was a decision both of them made, or just one. 

TLDR: I’m transgender and my grandparents won’t respect my name or pronouns so we’ve cut them off entirely. I think I might’ve overreacted and I’m starting to regret it

We texted back and forth over the week but since we were both busy we didn't get a chance to go out. We sort of set up an informal plan to grab dinner after our lab last night. 

I suggested we go to Outback since I really enjoy it, its somewhat affordable and it was a quick drive from the shuttle parking lot. She said she would rather eat glass than eat at Outback. I asked her where she wanted to go so she suggested like an overly expensive, farm to table restaurant that was almost an hour drive away. It was already going on 8 and I was starving but it also meant that I wouldn't be at home until at least 11 with all the driving and I had an 8AM class this morning. I agreed to go but it was clear that even me suggesting Outback had killed whatever spark had been there. 

We said our goodbyes and she sent me a text while I was on my home that said ""thanks for a miserable time, lets never speak again.k.thx.bi."" I was literally dumbfounded because the girl I was texting with last week didn't even seem to have such stupidity in her vocabulary. 

Am I the asshole here? Maybe I'm not hip or whatever, but am I an asshole?"
1146,afqezb,"WIBTA if I cut off my friend or at the very least expect an apology before moving forward? I have known my friend for years and their family treated me as one of their own children and siblings. 

Last February (2018) my friend met a person on Tinder and they got along well. I liked their significant other (SO). I thought that their relationship progressed very quickly, and soon my friend really stopped seeing and communicating with other mutual friends and their family. I saw this and communicated my thoughts that they were moving fast and they disregarded me. oh well. 

It should be noted that this friend has treated me fairly poorly in the past, but I wanted to move past it, things like leaving their house to go shopping while i am driving over and making me wait outside for an hour until they got home, discluding me from mutual friend activities, and not telling me that they were moving in with our mutual best friend, when I had communicated that I was interested in living together. 

I learned from mutual friend that Friend and SO had secretly married. (Note: they married because SO is from out of the country and would have had to move back to home country after graduating college, and married in Dec. 2018) So Friend and SO had a secret wedding where mutual friend and one of SO's friends and friends parents were there and were all told not to tell anyone. 

I learned from Friend's dad that they had married, and from mutual friend that they had this ""weird, secret marriage"" (MF's words).
My initial reaction was absolute heartbreak. I felt that Friend didn't trust me or love me enough to share this news with me, possibly because I was apprehensive about the progression of the relationship. Mutual friend agrees that this was the wrong move.

I've been reflecting, and I also feel that I made their happy thing about me. But if they were happy and proud, would they not have made this more open?

AITA and WIBTA?"
1147,6j6v0w,"AITA for getting mad at someone speeding past me? So about half an hour ago, I was driving home and it was about 12:30 AM, and I was coming up a long off ramp from the freeway. This guy was tailing me fairly closely over the short distance of freeway I had to cross to get home. Mind you, I was driving about 65 in a 60. Once I pulled onto the off ramp and pulled into the right lane to turn right (it connects with another road so it's two lanes leading up to the light) and he zooms past me and pulls in front of me, turns, and speeds off into the night. 

I mean I get having a nice, fast car and wanting to drive it fast or wanting to get home quick because it's late, but does that piss anyone else off? Or am I just an asshole?"
1148,agp939,"AITA for making a rude joke in a class group chat? 

So, for my APUSH class, my class made a group chat that had most everyone in it. Earlier today, someone asked if someone could send a picture of their completed assignment. Yknow. In normal group chat fashion. And a few popular guys in the chat were like ""no that's cheating"", ""do your own work that's not allowed"", ""this chat is for discussion"" and so on. 
So a few people, myself included, were like ""??? It's a group chat for class everyone uses these to cheat"". I asked if they were serious and one guy said they were, so I sent ""Cheating > ""Discussion"" all the way"" in a joking manner and one of the guys saved it. Now this guy, we'll call him Ryan, saves my chat and screenshots it and says that he's going to show it to our teacher so that she knows I'm a ""cheater"" and won't grade me easily because of my ""good student"" reputation. 
I got a little annoyed but didn't take it seriously. Until people started telling me that he was actually going to do it because he's done it before with others. Then I got really annoyed. I'll admit, I'm a nerd. I take being a teacher's pet a little too seriously. So I clearly didn't want my reputation put into question with teachers. 
Now, Ryan had recently been in a relationship with a friend of mine and had ended up cheating on her which made her end the relationship. Ironic, right? I sure thought so. So I said so- in the group chat. I said something along the lines of ""Funny that you think you've got any right to be mad about cheating, Ryan. You didn't seem to think it was so bad a few weeks ago."" And I expected everyone to be on my side... except most people are saying that i was unnecessarily rude... I thought I was being funny and he was taking the cheating shit too seriously as a whole. Guess I was wrong.
What do you guys think?"
1149,chgs18,"WIBTA If I told a stranger on the phone that the person they are looking for has passed away in order to get her to stop calling the wrong number? Context. Woo.

Few months ago bunch of people started calling me from numbers I don't know. I answered a few and they were asking for Rosie. I tell them they have the wrong number. Simple! 

No. Then I start getting text messages asking for Rosie. I reply that they have the wrong number. 

Nek minut. I'm getting texts from Rosie's daughters' school asking for my permission for her daughter to go on an excursion. I reply they have the wrong number. They continue texting me that same question for the week ahead.

As of recently (the last month or so). I keep getting spam text messages (i.e Telling Rosie she has won a million dollars or for Rosie to pick up her package from the post office etc.) 

As of two nights ago, the telemarketers started. Again, of course, asking for Rosie. I tell them they have the wrong number and instead give them Rosie's actual number (whose phone numbers' last two digits alternate from mine. Mine is 12, Rosie's is 21).

Now I have on multiple occasions texted Rosie multiple times to let her know that she is using the wrong number. She only ever replies 'thanks'.

Ok. So every so often (once a week), I get a call from a lady who wants to speak to Rosie. I tell her every time she had the wrong number. I keep giving her the right number. She keeps on calling me. Now I'm considering just telling her that Rosie has passed away to try to get her to stop calling. 

Now i do block every number that I can. But most of the numbers who are calling me are 'private numbers' and I can't block them.

Would it be wrong? Yes. Would it work? Probably not. Would it make me feel better? Yes. Is it illegal? Idk.

But would I be the asshole? Pretty sure the answer here is yes btw lol it's just getting redic at this point.


TLDR. Stranger thinks my phone number is her phone number. Won't stop giving out my number to her family. I keep telling her family they have the wrong number. Considering telling these numbers that Rosie has passed away.

EDIT: Another day, another text telling Rosie she's won something. 

EDIT 2: Rosie is a 58 lady from another state. With all the information she's indirectly provided me I know too much about her. I don't think she's messing with me. I think she's just stupid."
1150,dok80d,"AITA for being annoyed at my girlfriend for grilling me about my privilege? I (19M, white) am dating a girl (19F, white). We're both in college. Earlier I was telling her about how I was in math class and our teacher was handing back our exams we'd taken a week prior. I didn't get my exam back from the pile of exams he was passing out. After he finished passing them out, he went back to his desk, grabbed an exam, and walked over to me. It was my exam. He explained that on one of the problems, even though I got the answer correct, I didn't fully show my work, so he gave me a 2/10 for the problem. He told me he thought about it some more and decided to let me off with a warning and gave me the full points. My girlfriend told me this was an example of my white, male privilege. I told her i guess it was, but that I'm sure he would've done that for anyone else. We talked about it for a little more, and she became upset because she was interpreting the situation as me not willing to talk about my privilege or admit it. We've had this privilege conversation a couple times before over the course of the last year that usually starts when I tell her something she believes only happened to me because of my privilege. The scope of the conversation is always really narrow because she grills me about it personally. I tell her I have no problem talking about my privilege, and that I'm fully aware of it, but that every time she wants to talk about it it's because of something that happened to me, and we only talk about MY personal privilege, not the issue of privilege on a societal level. She says she feels uncomfortable that i'm being unwilling to admit my privilege and talk about it when she brings it up because it shows i'm not aware of my privilege. But I feel I'm totally aware of my privilege and willing to talk about it, and I just get a little annoyed because every time she brings it up it's because of something that happened to me and it feels like she just wants to make me feel bad about it. We never end up talking about it on a larger level because she only grills me about it personally. AITA?"
1151,enfxrd,"AITA for wanting to delete ex mutual friends after they dumped me? To cut a long story shorter, I was in a friendship group of girls growing up, one of whom was always TA but it was subtle - good at playing the victim, in competition with everyone (especially me), rude, horrible about her family members and so-called friends. I put it down to insecurity but her nastiness took it’s toll on me eventually and I told her she’d hurt me. She didn’t apologise, just verbally abused me, blocked me on everything, trash talked me to everyone and then ordered mutual friends to stop talking to me. Meh ok, should’ve expected it.

One of the girls tried to stay friends with me but it didn’t really work. I live further away from them all for work and TA makes the girl feel bad for even talking to me. All the others dropped me. TA found it funny how I “had nobody” now. 

It hurt that I lost my friends for finally defending myself against a bully, but I guess they weren’t true friends in the first place. I’ve made new ones and am focusing on more positive relationships in life!

Now... the question... some of the girls still follow me on social media. They don’t interact but watch all my stories and I don’t know why, except to be nosey, have content to trash-talk or MAYBE they still care about me. Idk. I only follow the one mutual friend who tried to remain friends, but she’s constantly posting photos of them all together and what good friends they all are, like some high school nonsense. 

Part of me wants to delete them all and move forward, including members of their families etc just for a clean slate. AITA if I delete them without explanation? The other part of me wants to leave it so they can see I DO have friends and a nice life without them. Jeez, even when they’re not in my life I feel like I need to prove myself.

1152,a6hmqy,"AITA for being annoyed that my work wants me to donate to charitable fundraisers? I started a new job a few months ago, and it's a good but not amazing salary. This company, at EVERY single company meeting or event very uncomfortably makes everyone feel obligated to donate to charities. Usually it's at the sign-in table so you can't avoid it -- and it's not just a jar sitting on the table, they fully engage with you about it so it's incredibly awkward to opt out.

The thing is, the company doesn't match donations or anything! I would be *all* for this if the company was taking on an equal burden. But this way, the company contributes nothing but can still get positive PR by saying ""(company) employees contributed $x to this cause!""

I feel that what I choose to do with the money the company pays me is none of the company's business, and if I'm going to contribute to a charity I'm sure as fuck not going to put the company's name on it when they are not contributing anything.

I can't really even fully articulate why this irks me so much and I tried explaining it to my husband and he didn't feel the same.

Every family gathering ends in several members drunkenly shouting at each other about politics and it makes me super uncomfortable.  I love coming over to see everyone and the first half of every event is great.  The problems start once the kids leave and its just the rest of the adults who didn't leave with them talking.  Well I've decided to simply say my goodbyes when I detect a fight coming to avoid being there for it since I can just walk down the street to my house.  Been doing it for a few months now without issue.

Well last weekend I did it and today I started getting texts from a few of my family members including my dad saying I am withdrawing from family when I leave suddenly like that and when I explained why I did it they all said that was a pretty shitty reason to not spend time with the family.

Now I'm not good at reading social situations so while I feel completely justified in what I did is it possible I've completely misread this and I'm actually an asshole here?"
1154,8o0t97,"AITA for not wanting the dog in my room? I recently moved house with my family. We have a dog who is blind and finds her way around mainly by sense of smell. Because of this, she's been spending her time sniffing very carefully around the house to get used to her new surroundings.

Also, she's recently developed a tendency to piss/shit in the house despite being taken for walks or let outside. Obviously no one wants her to ruin the carpets in the new house. My mum doesn't want to keep watching her to make sure this doesn't happen while she's unpacking boxes and sorting things out so she keeps bringing her into my room. She also brings her in at night, both so she doesn't do anything bad and because ""she's settling in"".

Before we moved here I told my mum more than once that I don't ever want the dog in my room. Not only do I want my carpets to stay clean, but at night she jumps on the bed and walks over me while I'm asleep, makes loud licking sounds and shakes her fur like dogs usually do when they've been in the rain (even though she's perfectly dry). I haven't had a good night's sleep for 3 days now. 

I told my mum again multiple times that I don't want the dog in here because she wakes me up and I don't want her messing up my room but she doesn't listen to me and repeats how she ""needs to be with someone"" or how she doesn't want her in the way while she's doing stuff. I reminded her that I made the rule that she wasn't to come in here even before we moved but that also falls on deaf ears. Am I in the wrong for not wanting the dog in here at any point?"

Would I be the asshole if seeing as I don't use the internet anyway I suggest they change the wifi password and I don't contribute to the bill anymore.


Other relevant info:

I've lived here about 3 months and the lease ends in Feb 2020. 

My housemate who is into gaming suggested we move to a more expensive plan ($10 more a month) and I agreeed because I thought it would make the internet work better in my room.

The girl who live in the room before me didn't have issues with the wifi because she mostly used her laptop with a booster I tend to just use my phone.


EDIT: 
The only place to plug the router is at the extreme other end of the house with a brick wall between me and the router. Moving it isn't an option. 

I had considered buying a booster but the sharehouse will be splitting up at the end of the lease so a joint purchase doesn't make sense.

1156,dni02u,"AITA for calling my girlfriend's stepmum a ""phase"" for her father? So I met my girlfriend's parents tonight. She doesn't like her father or stepmum very much, she stays in touch mainly for the sake of her younger sisters (they're both under 18 and under a custody agreement). The stepmum is his fourth wife.

My girlfriend is bisexual, and I'm the first woman she's introduced to them. She warned me ahead of time that even though she has already told them she is bisexual they would probably have an issue with me being a woman.

We had dinner tonight, everyone was civil, but then the stepmum started talking. I don't remember the exact phrasing but the gist of it was ""I'm so... surprised that you two are together, we all thought this was a phase, no offense meant"".

I took some offense, so I said ""we thought the same about you"".

Things got really tense really suddenly. No one addressed it, we were just sort of quiet for a while and then my girlfriend started talking to her sisters about something else. Evening ended pretty quickly.

After we left my girlfriend admitted she found it funny, but that this was not the first impression she wanted me to leave, and I might have made things uncomfortable for her sisters, who have another 24 hours with the stepmum and dad before they go back to their bio mum's. She says she's not upset, but it would have been better if I kept my mouth shut.

There was an ad for pride month beside one game, with something like ""gay is okay"" written in our language. So my brother read the first short word (gay) and asked me what it was. I explained to him it's when boys fall in love with boys or girls with girls.

Our dad heard that and he was sort of mad, saying my brother's too little for that talk. He closed the laptop and didn't let us use it anymore that afternoon. Then he probably told our mom because she also gave me a lesson on how I can't tell my brother such adult stuff.

What do you think, was that too much for a 5yo (I personally don't think so)? Am I the asshole or not?"
1158,d8f8ui,"AITA Work Dispute I am a bar manager and this evening on shift, I was working with a supervisor who we can call Pat.

One of the benefits for working for our company, is that we are eligible for 50% discount on all food and drink we sell at all times. This discount can in few and far between cases, be used for a friend here and there or a regular customer a loyalty type reward.  We also provide cards which give the holder 20% discount on everything at all times. This is important.

The 50% is staff only with abit of bend on the rules. 20% all the time for any customer with a card.

It was a quiet night and a load of Pats friends came in and ordered their drinks, and as the evening went on I saw Pat applying the 50% discount on a round of drinks. I stayed quiet and then checked his sales history and it turns out, he had been applying the discount to every single one of his friends for a few hours. This is legitimately gross misconduct within our code of conduct at work as it is an abuse.

I then quietly asked Pat what he was doing applying the discount to none staff customers, he responded with;
'They're my mates, the General Manager does it for some people and they're not staff so I don't see the problem'

My response was;
'The GM is our boss, and he doesn't answer to us, but we have to follow his rules, and he has made it very clear the discount is for staff with the odd exception, this is abuse. By all means give them the 20% because they're all card holders, but not 50%'

Patrick then walked off in a huff.

Now part of my job is due diligence, and so I shot my boss a quick text explaining what had happened and suggesting that his transaction history be investigated properly to see if this has been going on for some time, costing the bar a significant amount of money. My boss agreed wholeheartedly and has decided to investigate the supervisor for what is essentially a form of fraud. 

During the writing of my initial text to the boss, Patrick had been reading my phone screen over my shoulder and when I had finished, proceeded to make a scene about it, calling me a grass, and out of order and that I was in the wrong etc etc. 

I responded by confronting him over reading my screen over my shoulder, trying to explain that I could of been texting anybody, including private messages for my wife hypothetically and that he was massively in the wrong. I tried to explain that part of my actual job description is due diligence and the actions he was taking with the discounts, was something I needed to report to the GM.

Pat was having none of it and got all shitty about it, banging around the bar and generally throwing a silent tantrum. Apparently I am the biggest asshole to walk the face of the earth as this might result in Pat losing his job given his previous poor work performance.

I feel guilty for having to report him to my boss, but the alternative was the possibility of me being investigated for allowing him to abuse the staff discount button for his mates."
1159,dzcg13,"AITA for not wanting the sister-in-law to stay in my house My SIL(from US, unemployed) wanted to come to stay with us for a few months in Japan. She demanded $1300 for flight ticket, passport and traveling from the airport. Of course we'll have to cover all her living expenses here too. I already had the horrible experience living with her mom in our house in Japan before, and ended up being homeless. So I strongly said no to her offer. Also, we couldn't afford her. They got frustrated saying that I was ugly about money, that all I care about is money, and that to me money is more important than family. I straight up told them they were being greedy and selfish, and she was not welcomed in my house. My words can be harsh when I'm pissed off. But I did not get angry for no reason. My husband pulled out from his credit card to send her the money. She came anyways.

Despite disliking it so much, I still opened our door for her and treated her nicely. She got her own room with mattress and warm blanket. I work all day and my boy goes to nursery so she had the house for herself. I only saw her about 3 hours a day, at most. I asked my husband to take her to places. I took her to a nice restaurant on the first day she arrived. I bought extra food and shared with her what I cooked. She was very quiet most of the time. It made me feel pretty awkward. She did help with the dishes and spent a little time with my boy. I said I appreciated for that.

Then on the 3rd day, she started acting out. That morning I heard my husband joking around about the coffee she was struggling to make. It was the first time we brought Japanese coffee so I got curious and asked ""how much was this coffee?"". Right after that she dumped out the coffee in front of my face, stomped into her room, slammed the door and started crying. She said that I hurt her feelings, and that I'm always concerned about money. I got pretty pissed off but did not say anything. Then, she came sit on my chair, talking to someone on the phone a lot about how ignorant I was, and that she got really frustrated of my behavior. I stopped her right there, told her she was being full of shit and this disrespectful behavior is not accepted in my house. She yelled back then left. Later she came back and cried to my husband about how she tried to run away from her dark life in US but when came here all she got was mean words from me. I stomped out of my room said everybody has their own problem but decent people would try to solve it themselves, not to bring burden to other people's shoulders like what she was doing. She jumped up and down and yelled back at me. We both blew up and threw hurtful words to each other. I asked her to get out of my house. She didn't leave. She apologized. I did not. I am pregnant and all the stress she brought is hurting my baby. I believed I don't deserve to be treated like that in my house. I think I have the right to get angry and react strongly. She still wants an apology from me but I'm not gonna do it. Am I being an asshole?"
1160,cwfvha,"AITA for forcing my girlfriend to see a mental health professional? I’ve been with my girlfriend for ~10 years and during that time I’ve struggled with her mental health. She’s a REALLY tightly wound person and will get worked up to the point of crying over trivial/ridiculous things.

In undergrad she would call me ~once a week crying about...

Being afraid she failed exams (she was a straight A student)
Study groups she was getting close to ignoring her after the class they were in ended
A customer at work being rude to her
Her research instructor giving her criticism
Her roommate getting a better grade than she did in classes they had together.

And so on and so on... you get the point.

I’m pretty laid back. I don’t mind a bad grade here and there, getting criticism on something I did wrong, or embarrassing myself occasionally. I get frustrated when she can’t control her emotions in situations that I don’t think are a big deal. 

Tonight she called me and told me about how she posted a joke in a 90+ person group chat for her grad school class that didn’t get any attention. She took it personally and immediately jumped to being afraid that the whole class was judging her for a bad joke and that “everyone hates [her] now” (this same group of people just elected her to student government TODAY, btw). Then she started to cry.

I can’t just listen to someone else cry. I like to offer advice. That advice isn’t always phrased nicely, but it’s always well intentioned. Tonight I told her that “nobody hates [her] and that more than likely people just didn’t see the joke or skimmed past it”, and that “the world doesn’t revolve around [her], nobody in the group chat is even thinking about [her], much less thinking about how they hate her”. She didn’t take it well.

I’ve brought up the idea of seeing a psychiatrist before but she’s really nervous about the idea. She’s absolutely convinced that even if she did have a mental health issue (which she denies), she can fix it herself. In the past I’ve let this slide but I’ve become more aware of the importance of mental health recently and decided that it was time to put my foot down.

After a nearly 10 year relationship I told her that if she isn’t willing to at least try to see a mental health professional, I was going to break it off. If she’s not willing to see someone (for free, she gets it through her university) then I can’t see myself spending another 10 years with her. I told her she has until the end of September to at least make an appointment.

I feel like I’m in the wrong here. I’m essentially threatening her with ending our relationship to “force” her to see someone she doesn’t want to see, to fix a problem I don’t even know for sure that she has. On the other hand I feel like I’m not asking much; I specifically told her that I’m only expecting her to see a professional once and that if she gets a clean bill of health that I won’t bring it up again.

My department was given a survey about how things were at work and I spoke up about a lot of issues I felt were very serious, including but not limited to (and for context, we work with children) working high/intoxicated and not doing background checks for the individuals working directly/closest with kids. I’m personally really upset about these things. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with intoxication or even marijuana, but not around kids. 

A lot of people have been acting like I’m crazy for reporting this and my bosses threatened to fire me if I didn’t include them in the meeting with their boss about all this. The only coworkers who seem to have my back are ones who are notoriously bad workers themselves. It seems to me that I did the right thing, but the way support has been among fellow coworkers I’m not sure. I’m not sure if I should just concede to my coworkers’ opinions that they didn’t do anything that serious and not follow through with the meeting. I’m not trying to get someone in trouble if they didn’t deserve it.

Never mind that the manager (whom also waits tables) was talking shit behind my back, and my dude in the kitchen called me up telling me that they (boss and manager) were going to reduce my hours even after I attempted to communicate. Instead of replying to me, she went and trash talked me. 

So the plan is to have copies of both old and new certs, so when she tries to call me out in front of the boss I’ll simply pull out old and new certs and tell her “I informed you that I have my certification already completed. I also informed you that I didn’t have the gas to get out to the class, and that if it wasn’t paid I wouldn’t have a way to get back from the class if I could even make it. Which lead to no communication, reply, or resolution. I have my old certification which is less than a year old and my new one I completed online and neither of them expire.”

As a bartender I make the all of the restaurants alcoholic drinks and serve food to the bar (tables too if the servers can’t handle it or it’s just me), I show up to work, do my job, get positive reviews from customers, have a laugh or two with everyone, then go home.

1163,bf1hcl,"AITA for wanting to buy my niece a 3DS console? This is a throwaway because I don't want anyone to know it's me.

A little backstory. My niece is 14 and absolutely loves the Pokemon games. She had a 3DS that she used all the time, but a it met it's unfortunate end in an accident a couple of weeks ago.

My brother's financial situation is a bit unstable at the moment. His long term GF of about 7 years (who I'll call my SIL for simplicity) lost her job and either can't or won't get a new one (Idk the reason, it's none of my business.) My brother makes enough to support his family, he can put food on the table and pay all of the essential bills, but some of the more luxury things like Netflix/Hulu and his internet had to be cut out. He recently found out that his car will need a bit of work so he does have a financial hurdle he is trying to work around at the moment.

So here begins the actual conflict. My nieces birthday is coming up and my brother was talking to me a few days ago about how he may have to push any potential gift back by a few weeks because he can't really afford it. I'm single with no kids in a 2 bedroom apartment, so I have much more leeway in my budget. I offered to replace my nieces 3DS as a birthday gift. He gave me a bit of pushback because he didn't want me to have to cover his ass and there was no way he could pay me back in a reasonable amount of time, but I told him it was fine, that I didn't mind it at all, and that he didn't owe me anything. He is totally ok with it, he just wanted me to take credit for it and not put his name on it. I told him that I want to at least put their name on the $20 Nintendo gift card I want to get so that she can have something to open that is from them. We both agreed to that, he thanked me and I told him I'll buy it soon.

I found this badass Galaxy looking 3DS that I think she will absolutely love. I bought it, along with the $20 gift card. No problem.

This morning I woke up to a text message from my SIL. She's upset with me because she feels that the money I spend on a new gaming console could have gone to something like bills or the car payment, something that would help their family in the long run. She doesn't think it was a good idea to purchase my niece a 3DS at all and is upset with me because of it. She's even asking me not to give it to my niece and to take it back.

I haven't responded yet because I don't know what to say or how I feel about it. On one hand, she is totally right. The 200 dollars I spent on that game system could have really helped my brother and his family out. On the other hand, I should be able to do what I please with my money and it would be awesome if my niece could open a gift on her actual birthday. On top of that, my brother is totally fine with it and gave me the ok. I haven't talked to him about this yet, but I am pretty sure I am still going to give her the 3DS on her birthday.

So am I the asshole?"
1164,blcl0u,"AITA for not giving my uncle $5K My uncle (U) is in his late 50s. I'm in my late 30s. He's never been married or had kids. I'm married with 3 young kids. 

&#x200B;

20 years ago, U signed 2 student loans for me. 12 years ago, my grandmother died. U called me and said that he was using some of her life insurance to pay off one of the student loans. I thanked him and he said he wanted me to get on with my life since I was married and had a baby.

&#x200B;

A few years ago, my grandfather died. The house was left to U and my mom. U has always lived with his parents so it was agreed that he would continue to live there. There is no mortgage, so U would be responsible to pay the property taxes and utilities. Taxes are about $3400 a year.

&#x200B;

U recently called me and said he is behind on the taxes and going to lose the house. He said he can't afford to buy good groceries and his health is suffering as a result. He said he doesn't need much, just $5K should do it.

&#x200B;

I don't have $5K.  My husband and I both work full time but we also have a mortgage, childcare costs, etc. My uncle makes about $42K a year. He lives in a house with zero mortgage. I asked my mom what was going on. She said U is dating a girl and paying for her rent, driving her to and from work without her paying for gas, etc. He asked the girlfriend to move in with him but she refuses. Mom believes it's because the girl cheats.

&#x200B;

I asked U if he could sell some of his guns or military models, because I know he has a ton. He said he's tried but no one is buying. He went to a gun show recently to ""sell.""  However, his guns are currently being stored at my FIL's house, and he didn't retrieve any of them. So I know he didn't go to sell. He refuses to take out a mortgage on the property to help pay his bills.

&#x200B;

I don't know why he would need to borrow from anyone. I know he doesn't have a drug problem. He just mismanages his money. I'm very grateful that he paid off my loan 12 years ago. That was done as a gift though, and I have lived my life since then thinking that I don't have this debt to pay. I bring home $1600 every 2 weeks. He's asking for more than 3 of my full paychecks as ""not much."" AITA if I don't give U this money?"
1165,bkukz3,"AITA for not doing my friend's prom makeup after she rejected my offer? My senior prom was about two weeks ago; I planned on doing my own makeup the entire time, while my friends all got appointments to get their makeup done professionally. One of my friends waited until pretty last minute to book with someone, so the few places nearby were already packed for prom day. I offered to do her makeup for her, telling her I would be doing mine and it wouldn't be a problem. She kind of rudely rejected the offer? I'm not sure what she said exactly, but it came off as snarky. This is where I should say that I don't wear makeup to school, but I used to have an Instagram with 6k for my makeup looks, so I would say I'm pretty okay at doing it. I just let it go, and eventually she found someone outside of town to do her makeup. 

Fast forward to the week of prom, probably about three or four days before: the woman calls my friend and says she has to cancel their appointment. I'm not even sure how the makeup artist had her number, but maybe that's because I've never gotten mine done. I told her once again that I could do her makeup if she had no other options. I started to tell her that I promise I'm decent, but she got snide again so I just dropped it. She's always been catty, so I knew she couldn't be convinced, and I honestly didn't feel like helping her in the moment. 

I didn't really think about her makeup again until I saw her outside the venue before the doors opened. I hate to be rude, but she didn't look great. The thing I remember most vividly is that it looked like she had red craft glitter on her eyelids; it was large pieces sparsely glued on. Her skin didn't look good, but the eyeshadow was just horrible. I just want to paint a good picture: my friend is ginger and her eyebrows were too dark, not black but definitely not her shade. I felt bad for her, honestly, and she wasn't acting like herself so I figured she knew it was bad too.

My other friends talked about it the next Monday, the group being critical since it was honestly a horrific job. Apparently, she had gotten her much older neighbor to do it; I don't know why she had so little faith in me. I told the group that I had offered a couple times and one of the girls mentioned my old makeup account. I said that the main friend didn't want my help at all, being a little bitchy about it. My good friend said that I should have shown her what I can do, and that it's my fault I didn't give her an example. She made me feel guilty, telling me something along the lines of my friend's special night being dampened, and it was easily possible for me to have put up with her comments. My friend group seemed a little upset at me for being upset at her not trusting me? I feel like being being treated like an asshole, but I want outside opinions, honestly. Am I the asshole for not insisting I could do it? Am I the asshole for feeling hurt by my friends small comments?"

I've been living there for about a year but I am over her daughter always watching family guy, the simpsons, etc almost non stop when she's there and just being loud in general. When I come home from work I just want to have peace and quiet which doesn't happen with the tv blasting all night.  I've tolerated it for the most part as I watch them too but not back to back to back all night long (literally waking up in the middle of the night and it's still on). I've told my roommate my thoughts of this very nicely and she agreed but doesn't do anything about it. There's only one bathroom on top of all this. Now I'm being told that she will have her daughter full time as her dad is not doing his job of taking care of her.

I just don't want random strangers to be able to see pictures of my son like there could be child abusers on each of our friends lists that we don't even know about...

1168,a6johi,"AITA for not replacing my roommates items with upgraded versions? - So, for backstory, our roommate has very rarely been here since the first few weeks of August. During those first few weeks she adopted a cat from someone a few hours away who was abusing him. When he arrived at our house he was covered in mats and terrified. In this same week, RM's boyfriend got a house and she suddenly stopped being home for days at a time.

The cat pissed in one of her chairs, and one of our chairs within the first few days. My girlfriend and I dealt with it. Just continued to feed him and took it upon ourselves to shave him. He was much happier after that, but honestly still hated people. We told RM if we were going to take care of the cat all year, we should take the cat with us at the end of lease. She agreed to this.

In October, shortly after our boyfriend moved in, we realized the cat had peed on her futon. We threw about the pad, but I remembered her saying something about finding this on the side of the road, and the pad was already semi-gross so we kept it covered when we used it (broke college students amiright). We threw it out and started searching for a new used one. After I week, I gave in and texted her I was just going to buy a new futon pad for the frame so we would have something to sit on instead of an empty frame as the center piece of a living room. I ended up spending $200 on the pad for a new quality one.

After about another month, we are trying new techniques to help get the cat to get along with our other cats. This seemed to piss him off, and he decided to piss right on the center of our mattress. GREAT! So we throw it away, and decide that we should probably check our roommates bed since she leaves her door open when she leaves. We find that he seemed to have been pissing on it for awhile now, and the entire bottom half of her mattress pad (\~$57) was covered and her comforter (\~$20 & a few years old). We threw it away for her, since the smell was unbearable. We texted her and let her know what had happened, and RM immediately texted back links of a $170 dollar mattress pad and $80 extra plush comforter... We refused to buy those things since clearly we don't have that money to drop out of nowhere for upgrades of what was really her cats damages.. She says that isn't fair that we are picking and choosing what we will and not replace based on whats convenient for us, which we respond we don't understand what shes talking about, we haven't replaced anything for her to have. She freaks out, comes home and gather some of her things, and says after December she is moving in with her boyfriend. We had been expecting this for awhile so it was fine by us. She also got mad that we threw her things away, and since we had bagged them we went down to the dumpster and pulled it back out and put it in her room. We also decided to move our futon pad onto our boxspring since we can't currently afford a nice mattress, so it will do for now.

RM came home a week later and acted weirdly nice.. it put me on edge. The first thing she asked me was where the futon pad was, which I replied we were sleeping on it for now. RM said she agreed that the mattress pad that we put back in her room was too ruined and so was the blanket, but for some reason only threw the blanket away. She didn't really grab anything, just left and said she had to run errands.

I told my girlfriend and boyfriend that we should put a lock on our bedroom door, since we tend to keep our money in cash and have other valuables. We do it immediately after I recommended it. Very shortly after we get a text asking why we locked her mattress pad in our room. We were home at the time, and didn't know she had even been home, and so were very off-put that she would let herself in our room. Especially since I have heard her tell stories of stealing from people who she feels like owes her.

Suddenly, after refusing to answer our text about when she will be by to get her stuff, RM shows up at 7am with her boyfriend and 2 strangers. They are throwing things around and generally treating my home and belongings with disrespect. They leave the door wide open while doing this, even though we have 2 cats now (we got rid of the one that destroyed our mattress - sorry kitty). I don't want to bother them so we all leave ourselves locked in our room. Suddenly she pounds on the door, and I come out and she tells me shes going to call the cops if I don't give her the futon pad. I explain calmly that I have a receipt, so she can call the cops but they aren't going to do anything. I attempted offer to help buy her a new used one, but she insisted she needed the brand new one we are currently sleeping on. I give up and go back in my room.

About ten minutes later the cops come. I show them the receipt and tell them whats going on. They stay there until she gathers her stuff. In the meantime I realize my cat has went missing and RM and those she was with snickered while we walked around searching for her. She eventually got her stuff all out, but she was pissed when the cops told her the futon pad wasn't hers and she wasn't allowed back on the property.

We found the cat terrified in the back of the cabinet. All the people slamming stuff around spooked her. What an eventful morning."

In September my mother is paying for my entire family to go to Disneyland including my sister her husband and kids. my sister and her family are going down early to spend time at the beach and other things you can do in Los Angeles. I am wanting to do the same. I am 24 and I want to take my jeep down early to the beach to camp and try some of the local fishing spots. 

my mom, dad, little sister and I were originally going to drive down Monday to spend the next Tuesday through Thursday at the parks and drive back Friday. so this is where it gets a little weird. my parent have been separated for the past 10 years but still get along pretty well. we all get together for holidays and birthdays and the such. so if I didn't drive down with them that would just be my mom dad and sister driving down and my mom absolutely hates the way that my dad drives. He is very aggressive when he drives and he takes pride in his driving skill. I would have acted as a bit of a buffer and another driver between them. 

Since I took the entire week off of work I would like to get the most out of my vacation and go down a few days earlier. but when I told my mom about this she gave me a guilt trip that she just wouldn't go or fly to California from Arizona. Am I the asshole for wanting to enjoy my vacation?"

So when I (f) was little (now I'm 15)  me and my cousin(m), and our parents used to visit our grandparents monthly. We also celebrated our (me and my cousins) birthdays there. Our grandma always got us small things like chocolate when we visited her.

At my cousins 12th birthday ""party"" (I was 5 at the time) (It was small, only me, my cousin, my grandma, my grandpa, my mother and my aunt were there), after my cousin opened his presents from grandma (candy, money, some toys, a remote control car, for example), she gave me a coloring book and some bedsheets.

The next day (we stayed at  our grandma's house for around 3 days.) my aunt remarked that she thought it was insensitive to give me stuff when it was someone elses birthday, and my grandma agreed and apologized

At the time it made me very upset. I think this was petty, as we always get somehing from our grandma when we visit her, and we weren't there for his nrithdday exclusively and it's not like it was the same value, and there were lots of occasions, when my grandma favoured my couskn and no one batted an eye.

After the show, partially because I was unable to see it, I asked my friend and her boyfriend (both of whom are close friends of mine) what they thought of my show. They informed me that they were unable to pay attention to it because a mutual friend of ours was sitting next to them and talking to them through large parts of the show. Of course, it is theatre etiquette 101 not to talk while a show is happening, and I was pissed off since my friends were unable to watch my show because of uncorteous audience behavior. So I texted my mutual friend who talked for the entire show and told her that I was disappointed and kinda angry at her for talking through my show, informed her how sad I was that my friends were unable to watch my show due to her talking, and told her if she had no interest in seeing a show that she should simply not watch it instead of coming in and talking through the whole thing.

1172,7zzrn8,"AITA Parent possibly stealing money from me and call them out, they get pissed at me So long story short, I am 21 and recently moved out my parents house into a place of my own, just for a little background info. Now one semester at school I had to take out a loan for X amount to pay off remaining tuition. Fast forward to now and I have X amount ready to pay back once the payment period starts, which isn't for a WHILE. I had saved the money in a joint account between my mother and myself cause I was only 19 at the time and had yet gotten my own separate bank account. Apparently parent moved the money out of the joint account, into my other shared account, then moved it into another account where I could not access it. So of course I get suspicious (this isn't the first time she has done shady shit like this) I question saying ""where did my loan money go"" she tells me what she did with it, as I expected. Now upon telling her that it is my money and now that I am out of her house and 21 years old she no longer has the right to watch over my money. It isn't right for her to keep hold of money, that I have earned by the way, just because she ""says so"" and then she gets pissed at me for calling her out on that. Like wtf AITA? am I wrong? Cause god forbid that something happens and I need that to fall back on and now can't cause she has it under lock and key.

1173,anj2zb,"AITA For asking for a Wi-Fi password at a museum? I went on a class trip to a WWII museum on a very famous WWII battle ground. We were in a large group and the museum was already pretty full so they crammed our group into a small room with a room with a pretty sad exhibit about the battle that had happened there. After reading through the whole exihibt we were still stuck in the room and I didn't have anything to do. 


Because we're in a different country, I couldn't use my data or texting because I didn't pay for a travelling plan. So I pretty much just rely on connecting to public WiFi whenever I get the chance so that I can talk to my mom. Well I thought I was just in luck because I saw that the museum had a connection called ""public WiFi"". I connected to it and then it redirected me to a website where it asked for a password. Confused, I asked the lady guarding the door what the password was. She was happy to help me. After a bit of back and forth she determined that it was just a glitch and I didn't even need a password. She fixed it and I went on my way. 


Well a few moments later a hear a girl from my group (that I had never talked to) going on about how ""some bitch asked for the WiFi password"". She went on behind my back accusing me of disrespecting the soldiers and being ""too addicted to her phone"".


I instantly felt bad but my friend reassured me that he would've done the same thing.

1174,bzazvl,"AITA if I Took My Parents' Cat When I Move? Long time lurker, first time with everything.

So, between me and my parents, we have two cats. One is mine (as in I rescuer her and cared for her since she was a week and a half), the others is theirs, whom they adopted when he was seven weeks old.

My parents do not like cats. In my childhood, we had two cats (they passed in 2018) that dad would torture in some way. He always enjoyed making them angry to the point of hissing/spitting and aggressive. One, he would always pull her tail and drag her close to him until she was howling.

Now! He treats their dogs and my brothers dogs amazingly well. As in deeply spoil, give a lot of treats and so on. He wasn't willing to put our elderly dog down until she couldn't even stand--but was quick to jump on putting my elderly cats down for easily fixed problems.

But he treats my girl nicer, and has become super attached to her. He gives her way too many extra treats, buys her cat toys, and so on. A clear and major change from how he treated my other cats. He has mentioned a few times she would be better in a house and not an apartment, but I want to take her with me. He's ""joked"" about hurting her to get a reaction out of me quite a few times.

However, he doesn't treat his cat as well--while he gives him extra treats, there's very little concern for him outside of if he gets injured. Tonight, he got pissed because the little boy was meowing because he wanted attention and stormed towards the cat. He always terrorizes him when he's mad. They lock my cat and theirs in the laundry room and wonder why my cat had issues with closed doors.

But it's not always like this! He's also always really nice to them too, but if they meow frequently or are just plain noisy, he gets livid.

And I'm moving in a few months and I want to bring them with me. Dad would be heartbroken over Eevee, and mom over Dusty. But they don't like cats very much and I think I'd be doing them a favor.

I would also feel guilty. So. WIBTA if I took them with me?"
1175,egijkp,"AITA for telling my cousin I won't watch her dog on New Year's even though I am at home that night? I just got a text from my cousin saying that she got invited to a party on New Year's Eve spontaneously and asked me if I could watch her one year old labrador puppy on that day. 

She probably knows that my boyfriend and I will be staying at home with our dog that night as we usually do an New Year's. 
Now my dog has SEVERE anxiety around fireworks since she has PTSD from when a kid threw a firecracker after her a couple years ago (she also hates thunder ever since because the sound is similar - she was completely fine with it before the incident) We're doing everything to we can to help her with the situation, as we started giving her medication for stress relief about a week ago and will be taking several precautions on that day and the days surrounding.

My cousin's dog and mine know each other but they haven't seen each other in a while. My dog usually gets on well with other dogs but she likes to be left alone and isn't overly interested.
From what I have observed my cousin's dog still has a ton of playful puppy energy and likes my dog to play with her. She's also around twice the size of my dog. 

If we were to take her on that day I am worried that my dog will have a big contributing stress factor and on top of that I have no idea how my cousin's dog will handle the situation since New Year's Eve is living hell for most animals. 

So I told my cousin that I'm sorry but I'm uncomfortable with the situation and can't watch her dog on that day which means that my cousin will likely not be able to attend the party.

1176,bti9qq,"AITA for asking someones kid to put something back? On mobile, sorry for the formatting. So some back story here-

I work at a smaller grocery store as a cashier, nothing huge like Walmart we usually only have 3-5 employees in at a time. So, anyways, today we were a little low on staff, right in the middle of a shift change, and its the Sunday before memorial day so everything is already a little hectic.

I have a lady in line who has 4 children with her, One of her children (roughly 9/10yrs old) Had a box of ice cream sandwiches  He asked his mom if it would be okay if he could go put them back in the freezer to which his mother said ""Nuh-uh! just give them to her, she'll put them back."" This bothered me a bit. but i didn't really think too much of it.

So the kid hands me the ice cream and, I say something along the lines of ""Thanks, bud. If you did really want to take it back for me that would be super nice, and helpful! We have a pretty long time, so I don't know when the next chance I'll have to put it up!"" I said that in a calm friendly manner,  and the kid replied ""sure, no problem!"" also in a calm friendly manner. His mom got really upset and exclaimed ""It's her job! You don't have to do anything. because she's to lazy to do it herself!"" and went on to ask me who I thought I was trying to maker her kid to do my work for me, and why I think it's appropriate to ""parent"" her child. The woman is totally irate. I tell her that I'm sorry if I offended her, that it wasn't my intention, and just explain that we had lost a lot of product today because we were unable to take it back, because lines had been so long. I was calm, professional, and (I think) fairly rational. She, of course, just got angrier and demanded a manager.

Like i know that people kinda just suck. I've done customer service for 8 years, but nothing that really made me question if I was the asshole in the situation until now. She was obviously a little bit aggressive, but did I ""parent"" her kid? ""By asking for her kid to put back an item he didn't want, Does this make me The Asshole?

1177,cizzoi,"AITA for involing my neighbor's brother in an issue? Hey guys,

So my neighbor(25M) smokes weed regularly.

He moved to a nearby country (to study) where he wasnt able to get any.

He is back in the country and asked me if I know anyone to get him some weed.

He has no money himself and asked me to buy some for him.

I talked to someone and spent about 13 USD, which was all the money I have(parents are out of the country), as my neighbor promised he would pay me back.

Since I have no personal money now, I asked him 3 days later, today, about the money. 

Turns out he was silently hoping his parents would randomly give him money. He never planned to ask them directly. 

He was being an asshole about this and in the end I told him that if he wont ask his family for money, I will. He just replied with ""Uh huh"".

That pissed me off

So I called his brother and told him the story and to tell my neighbor to ask his parents for money.

I apologised for involving him but I have zero personal money on me.


Now I know I'm am idiot for trusting my neighbor and I regret trying to help him.

I also regret calling his brother for help. Thing is, if I have to, I will bring this to his parents(not mentioning the weed part) to get my money back.

So Reddit, AITA?

EDIT: to people solely focusing on the 13$: I had more. I spent it going out and 13$ was the remainder. Also I get my allowance monthly and this month I didnt even get half,thus me short of money.  Normally I wouldn't have cared if I was owed money and never tell people they owe me money, but my neighbor pissed me off and not caring at all.


Edit 2: one reason I went to his brother was the ""uh huh"". People seem to think they can walk all over me and expect me to just sit there and accept it. I wanted to show him that he cant go around thinking I'll roll over because I'm scared of confrontation."
1178,dmdgq0,"AITA for not wanting my sick Grandmother to live with me 24[F]? My grandmother started living with me and my family since I was a child. But it has been off and on, like 3-5 years at a time and then she goes back to her home country. My mom kept kicking her out and then letting her come back. I live in America btw. 

The reason she’s kicked her out so many times is because my mother can’t take her behavior. A few years ago my mother swore to my grandmother that she would never allow her to live with her again. 

She was such a huge burden. She constantly faked illnesses for attention. She constantly over exaggerated her ailments and was very extremely needy. She wasn’t even that old when she lived with us back then. She would eat leftovers that weren’t hers and lie about it. She would lie about being broke while having thousands in her bank account. She would make you feel guilty and like a horrible person if you couldn’t help her with something as simple as bringing something to her room at the very moment she asks for it. 

I felt like her personal fucking nurse and she wasn’t even sick.

Back when we used house phones, she’d listen in on our conversations. Like I’d be on the phone with one of my friends and realize she was listening..

She would pray out loud for God to curse us (me, mom, and siblings). She would just manipulate us so badly to get what she wanted. She would call my moms friends and twist stories to make it seem like my mom is a bad person that wants her to suffer. 

She has like 7 children in the US and none of them have ever let her stay with them because of her ways. Only my mom has. 

I honestly can’t think of one good memory of my grandmother.

Now she’s actually sick forreal and wants to come stay with us. She needs the healthcare because it’s better hear and her condition can be fatal. I’m not going to tell my mom about how I feel because that’s literally her mom.

I just feel like a bad person for not wanting her to stay here.

EDIT: She’s actually been diagnosed by a doctor, so it’s actually real this time. As much as I don’t want to believe it.. it’s true."

This has been bothering me for some time. I look after kids as a part of my job. Last week, our organization took the kids (4-5) to a local water park that had a play ground. Upon arrival, we noticed that there was different daycare there. Their kids ranged from 5-12 years old and although some of the staff wore unified colours, they didn't have actual uniforms so it was difficult to identify who was a staff.

Sometime after lunch, one of my kids came up to me and told me that some kids were throwing sand at my children. I see three kids - two older (about 11-7) and one younger (maybe 5?)- throwing sand at a group of my kids. One of them was crying and I'll admit that I was furious. As I approach, the three kids start running away and I tell them to come back. I said something along the lines of: ""why are you throwing sand? Do you not see that she is crying and is younger than you? Look how its hurting her: you should be ashamed of yourselves. Don't throw sand. I want you to apologize to her."" I also ask if they're here with their parents or organization and they say they're here with a daycare but I notice no one is supervising them on the playground.

 As they begin walking away, they suddenly turn around and say someone from their own organization is throwing sand at them. They show me who and I say ""Please do not throw sand at other kids. It can hurt them."" Suddenly, someone from the other daycare (I didn't know who she was at first) said ""excuse me, I don't think you should be talking to Kid like that. I just think it's inappropriate of you. If you have a problem, talk to one of the supervisors."" So I apologize and speak to one of the supervisors. She apologizes and so do I for not speaking with them sooner.

I just want to know if I was the asshole for disciplining the children throwing sand? I know I should have talked to one of their staff, but I really did not see any of the supervisors from the other daycare looking after their kids on the playground. Maybe I was too harsh on the kids too?

TLDR; 3 kids from another daycare (about 11,7, and 5) throwing sand at a group of my kids with one crying (4-5). Told them not to throw sand and that what they did was shameful. No staff from the other daycare seen supervising their kids on the playground until I speak to one of their other kids to not throw sand. Staff said I was acting inappropriately. AITA?"

1181,7776zb,"AITA for protesting against playing guitar at a small party? So, I was at this small party at my friends house with my parents for an occasion, about 15 adults total were there of whom only about 6 or 7 I knew and the only other teen there being my friend. 

Its late in the night and I am chilling in my friend's room watching the Hangover while he eventually nods off. My Dad walks in a few minutes later and says to come outside as we are leaving now. I fix my hair and walk outside expecting people to be leaving but everyone is seated drinking with one person playing guitar. My dad invites me to sit with him and eventually everyone is asking me to play something, I try to protest as I am extremely shy and was not comfortable but the guitar gets passed to me anyway and I just half-ass the start of Stairway to Heaven. I try to pass it to my Dad but he doesn't take it, everyone is cheering me on wanting me to entertain them. My mom finally takes it and whispers to me that I'm a pussy then I resign myself to my phone. This goes on for half an hour until I use a joke about leaving me to sleep there as an exit to go back to my mate's room. We then leave an hour and a half later.


The next day, when saying goodnight to my parents, I confront them about why they did that last night. My dad just played it off and told my mom I am always whining without giving a reason, while my mom thinks I am a pussy and that I should have been a sport and also that I embarrassed our family.

A few friends and I were invited to play some touch football at the beach one day with some random people we met who were throwing around a football.

He talked a bit about it a bit later on telling us how he tore his ACL in high school and how it sucked.

After a while of playing, we all getting very tired and almost falling over. I ended up tripping myself out of fatigue when running for the ball and said something along the lines of “I better watch out or I’ll end up tearing my ACL.”

After saying that, the guy who tore his ACL started to criticize me about how tearing an ACL is a serious thing and shouldn’t be joked about.

I understand tearing an ACL is serious but this guy seemed perfectly fine playing the game and I thought it wasn’t too serious of a thing for him since he was making a joke about it earlier. AITA?"

I settled on Hawaiian food. I picked out what I wanted, ordered and set my phone down. I had to leave a tip in the order. So I left a $3 tip, this tip was included in my order. Usually I chose the $3 tip and then give the delivery person $2 in cash when they get to my door. 

So anyway I’m waiting and I check the map and see my driver is at the restaurant. I check again 10 minutes lasted and she’s still there. Whatever it’s probably busy. So then I get a text saying my food has been picked up and on it’s way. I live about 1.5 miles away. It took her 20 minutes to get here. Then I saw her car in the app was in from of my house. And there she was, I looked out and saw her there. On her phone. She looked over at my house and then back at her phone. I’m like wtf is she waiting for. So after a minute I get upset, put some pants on and go outside. THEN she gets out of her car and says “I’ve been out here for like 5 minutes” I told her she’s supposed to come to my door. To which she replies that no she’s isn’t and I have to request that and she never goes to the door. 

So at this point I’m like whatever and she hands me my food and just stood there for a second. Then she goes “no tip?!”

I say I DID tip you, my order includes a tip. And she goes, yeah but that’s only $3. She then says “I was in the restaurant for half an hour, and then had to figure this maze of a neighborhood to get to your house. I think I deserve more”

1185,dpp1jx,"WIBTA for refusing to put my bosses car seat together? So context. On mobile, sorry in advance. 

I am an executive assistant for a start up company that has a very specialized service with little to no competition, so business is good. My boss, who I will call Miranda, has many, many requests for me that are very out of the box, because it is a small business there are lots of tasks to be done. Running errands, inventory, paying business and home expenses for her, drop offs and pick ups for very heavy equipment or furniture, you get the idea. Just 2 days ago I moved an 8 foot couch, by myself, with a Toyota corolla, so you could say I manage to get things done with determination and critical thinking skills. Everything Miranda has asked of me, I'll do. 

Except. Putting her under 2 year olds car seat in her vehicle. Miranda is a very private and protective person, especially with her kids (4 total). I have barely met them because I only work on the business end of things, which is fine, work/life balance is a fine line. I have two kids of my own she has not met, nor do I see any reason for her to. 

That being said, I feel incredibly uncomfortable putting together her under 2 year olds car seat because I feel this crosses that work/life balance line. Another thing that makes me really uncomfortable about it is the fact I cannot physically carry a child to term due to a myriad of health issues (my two kids are older adopted kids, didn't get them as babies) and dealing with the car seat feels very personal and intimate because of the glaring reminder I won't be putting MY biological child into one. 

I told Miranda I did not want to assemble or transfer a car seat for her and she got very mad at me, told me it was not personal, just logistical and I need to get over it. I responded with all the reasons above why I did not want to do it, she said again to get over it and that I had to do what was assigned to me. 

Meter check here Reddit, AITA?

Tl;dr I cannot have babies and assembling a babies car seat is a total bummer, but my boss says to get over it.

Update: Thanks for the input. I told her and her wife that I was incredibly uncomfortable and if they wanted me to put their car seat in, then I would have to take it to the fire department and that would take time away from my more time sensitive tasks. Threatened with the thought of me not completing something, they decided to just do it themselves. Boundary set, kind of."
1186,dlhqgu,"AITA for refusing to help my mum after she deliberately said ""you know nothing"" in a context of im young and dumber than her. Hi, this is my first Reddit post so forgive me for any formatting mistakes (I found this subreddit through Cue youtube videos and I love some of the stories here)

So let me give you some context, me and my family are polish immigrants and are currently living legally in the UK. My dad\`s, my sister\`s and my english are nearly fluent (we are able to freely communicate with anyone) whilst my mums isn\`t as good as ours but she can still talk, but she needs constant help with translating documents, making doctors/hospital appointment and then attending them especially after she miscarried her last baby. Furthermore, since our dad left us (he moved since they are divorced and mum had full custody) she also needed a strong person to carry all the stuff and since I was the strongest after our dad all the carrying and jar opening fell on me.

So going back to the story, this happened today roughly 2 hours ago and me and my mum went to make another doctor's appointment since she wanted to start taking birth control pills. Then she began to rant about my pills as they make me bleed a lot (it\`s normal since they are Progesterone only pills) and I told her that it was normal and my doctor said that I was fine. I can\`t share details of the argument we had since it was really personal but she judged me for my sex life and how I have it etc. so I got pretty annoyed and called her out on her accidental pregnancy (she knowingly didn't use any forms of BC and then ranted about it) and how she got me out of college so I could help her through her miscarriage in a hospital (she went to get a scan and I had to go with her) and then came back to the talk about different types of BC since she didn\`t want the pills I recommended her. She then proceeded to say ""You know, nothing, you are young and stupid"" so I just thought \`Screw that\` and sat in the lobby of the surgery we went to so she could do her own appointment since I\`m Stupid.

As you could\`ve guesses she lashed out on me but that\`s irrelevant to the post but if needed I can give more details. So AITA?

Thanks for the comments and perspective. I will definitely use some of the advice given here next time if a similar situation happens. :D"
1187,cnn2s9,"AITA for blocking a girl from leaving my house because she stole from me? I'm a woman if this changes anything.

Two days ago I had a part for friends and some of them brought a +1. My friend Jake (name changed) brought a girl with him. They're not romantically involved, just friends according to him. They both drove their own cars.

So we have a great night until another of my friends tells me this girl was upstairs. I don't know what anyone is even doing on the second floor of my house, period. That's not normal party etiquette, yeah?

I got two cameras: one facing the back door, and one in my bedroom. I excused myself to go into the basement and check the security DVR and found her snooping through my jewellery cabinet in my bedroom.

I pulled her aside and asked her what she was doing in my bedroom and she said she was just looking around at my beautiful house. I called bullshit and said I saw her in my jewellery. I don't know if she stole anything but it seemed like it. She suddenly had to leave in an awful hurry, so I stopped her.

I decided to not let her drive away. She's free to walk home, at night, in the rain, and I wouldn't let her take her car unless she agreed to empty her purse and pockets. If she wasn't comfortable with me doing it, I'd be glad to have an officer come down and do it instead.

She didn't hesitate and just walked away in the rain. Her car is still in my driveway two days later, blocked by my car behind her. She ghosted my friend Jake on all social media.

Some people at the party said I was being an asshole and ""kidnapping"" her, when all I did was stop her taking her car. Many more agreed with my actions, though.

Was I the asshole?"

1189,9ztw6t,"AITA for staying too long in a coffee shop? Brand new coffee shop opens in our city's new library. It's a really nice place and they have great coffee, so I decided to sit in there and work on my laptop.

I was sitting at a low bar seat next to the window, and to avoid taking space of the person next to my right, the best place for me to put my coat happened to be the floor wedged between myself and a book shelf. It was a new place and the floor wasn't too dirty dirty, and I figured I'd make the sacrifice of potentially dirtying my coat so the space next to me wouldn't be obstructed.

4 hours later, my coat had worked it's way in to the general space without me noticing. The manager must have noticed this, because he stormed over to me, and with a hurried and aggravated demeanor, stuffed my coat in to the now empty chair next to me and pushed the chair in to the bar, then walked back behind the counter. Not a word.

I figured I had outstayed my welcome, maybe he was mad because I was sitting there so long? I bought a coffee and a sandwich, it's not like I was freeloading.

In my experience, that's what people do at coffee shops, camp out on their laptops. I was a barista at three different coffee shops, I was never bothered by people who stayed there all day. They tipped the best and were usually very friendly.

In this case, the coffee shop is right next to the library, so I could have worked there instead.

Whatever the case, I didn't say anything, I just packed up my things and left since it seems like they wanted me gone. I'm pissed about it, but still not sure if I was in the wrong."
1190,arihjx,"WIBTA for wanting to distance myself from my best friend who begged me to go out only to go hang out with her boy friend an hour after being there? My best friend is a very type A personality person. She hates being cancelled on, she hates when others are late, and she hates plans that aren’t concrete. I have ADHD and depression so I try my best to always meet her on time, etc. 

Today she calls me (I had full intents of staying home and doing laundry/ napping / watching tv and ordering takeout) and begs me to come shopping with her so we can go out tonight. I tell her I’m not sure about whether or not I want to go out. I’m obviously hesitant and tired. She begs and tells me we can do something low key and that of course I can always leave when I want because she’s planning on having her FWB come over after. I agree. 

We spend 3 hours shopping a few different stores (a strip) and she asks me to be ready by 11:30. We meet at a place that costs me $22 to Uber to. I have 2 drinks. And we’re there for an hour and 10 minutes when she tells me she has to go because the guy she’s been hooking up with (who was with his own friends) was tired and going to his house. So he told her she could come over. He also told her she could come by tomorrow if she wanted instead. 

She told me she feels bad because we “just got here” but she also doesn’t “want to keep him up” so she’s going to go. I tell her next time she should invite me out for longer than an hour at a time and she tells me “she knows” and that she “fucked up” in the least apologetic way lol. She orders an Uber and leaves 3 minutes later. I order another $20 uber to go home. 

I am 100% certain that had I done that to her she wouldn’t be cool about it at all. So she texted me when she was in her Uber about something unrelated and I didn’t respond. I just feel like I was better off staying home and if he gave her the option to come by the next day, why couldn’t she do that? She’s very quick to cut people off and if I was in her situation I would tread carefully knowing how impulsive she can be. I don’t want to cut her off but I also feel like this was a waste of an outfit, over $70 (drinks, covers, Uber’s, etc) in an hour’s time. WIBTA if I cut contact with her for a few days?

1191,ayhui6,"WIBTA for not reconnecting with an old acquaintance after his father passed? A while back, a buddy of mine (not a close friend by any means) blocked me and ignored my texts out of nowhere. Mind you, this is right after I did him a huge favor for free using my professional skills. Turns out the girl he was dating was jealous or whatever. We have never been romantically involved or even flirtatious in any way.

I was totally appalled and wrote him off. Dude is in his mid-20’s, not a teenager. That’s a terrible way to treat someone who’s been nothing but kind to you. 

Months and months later he reached out to say he’d “been manipulated” blah blah blah and tried to rekindle our friendship. I ignored the message. He tried again and I ignored that, too. I didn’t feel I had any obligation to respond.

Today he hits me with “My dad died last night, I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me”.

I’ll be honest. I was totally disgusted. Leveraging your own father’s death to guilt someone you weren’t even that close to into rekindling a friendship they’ve made it abundantly clear they don’t want? But people can act oddly when grieving, I get that. Still can’t help feeling repulsed and manipulated.

I have not yet replied but was thinking of simply saying that he had my condolences for his loss, but that I was uninterested in rekindling our friendship. TBH I’m in a foreign country on an emergency visit to see a dying relative of my own. As terrible as it sounds, I have no desire to listen to this guy cry about his loss right now. I feel he absolutely should be leaning on his family or closer friends at this time. 

I have no desire to pile hurt on a person who just lost a parent. That’s tough stuff. But I can’t help but feel really skeeved and frustrated and backed into a corner.

We also share the bed with our 2 year old most nights and he wakes up a few times during the night which also wakes me up as well. 

I asked my husband to only have one alarm in the morning so that I have more chance to get back to sleep after he goes to work (I don’t get up until 7 or 7:30 with my son).

Bio dad and I both decided we couldn’t be good parents and chose to give the baby up for adoption to a lovely woman (S) and her fiancé. 
She was an amazing person and helped a foolish young me who had zero support through the entire pregnancy.
Bio dad (my teenage ex) didn’t want any contact, but the rest of us wanted an open adoption.

I would see my bio daughter on holidays, events, my birthday. I went no contact with my abusive family so I spent a lot of time with this family. It’s almost like S adopted me as well in a way. I never lived with them, but she did help me get on my at 18 when I moved away from my bio family. 
S married her fiancé after being on and off again. He wasn’t a good person, would always make excuses for his bad habits (coming home at 3 am drunk) and cheating. She forgave him and they finally married.

S always vented to me about him and how he didn’t help with daughter or anything involved in the household. 3 years after their wedding He cheated again and they separated. He no longer lived with S or daughter.
A couple more years pass and S is diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer and passes within 8 months.
During this time ex was MIA. They never legally divorced. 
I am now 28 and do very well for myself. S knows I’m her bio mom, she always knew and while S was alive we all discussed that I become daughter’s legal parent again. I’m very happy with this and so is daughter even know it was an extremely hard time for her losing her adoptive mother.

Ex husband comes out of the woodwork and starts demanding things that are “rightfully” his like S’s money and property. 
She left money to daughter. Ex says he is daughter’s father and that he wants sole custody. That he misses his wife and daughter is only family he has left.
We will legally be fighting for custody and both have lawyers.

I’ve been getting harassed by him and his parents. His mother “grandma” says that I gave up my parental rights and didn’t want to be a mom when it mattered so I’m a terrible person for ripping a girl away from her father after she suffered the loss of her mother.
As far as I’m concerned I’ve been close with my daughter from the beginning and S knew this. S was my friend and saw what she went through with her ex’s drinking and cheating. He never wanted to deal with daughter and never wanted the responsibility of a child. 
He was missing for chunks of her life.

He’d had a nightmare that I had been pulling away from him and eventually broke up with him, which really upset him. It was a long, drawn out dream he insisted on telling me immediately and I kept dozing off because he had just woken me up, it takes a while for me to actually fully wake up (always has), and I’d only gotten 5 hours as opposed to my normal 8 hours of sleep. It wasn’t that I was trying to fall back asleep, I truly didn’t mean to.

So around two months ago I decided to come out to my mother as gay. At first she seemed fine with it and it really didn’t seem too bad. However, the next day I decided to tell her that in the past I had dated a girl. She immediately flipped out and started calling me manipulative, abusive, a liar, and many other things along the lines of a traitor and a fake. This went on for almost 5 days, and I got fed up with her behavior. So I went ahead and told her this was really disgusting behavior and she wasn’t acting like a parent; she told me I was being an arrogant teenager. 

Fast forward a week or so and everything seems fine. Until she starts nitpicking at everything I do. Didn’t tell her about a friend? She’d scream at me, didn’t eat all of my dinner or lunch? Another screamfest. This got so bad that I started locking myself away from her because I couldn’t take all of this.

Fast forward another couple of weeks and she calls me and arrogant bitch for not giving her a hug? I know I may have come off as rude because I was moody that day and I didn’t ask how her work day was but I don’t think it warranted that reaction. 

An instance soon after that happened where one of my teachers found out about my condition and called the counselor. The counselor had to notify my mom and then she talked to me. 

She said that I had caused all the fights with her by being rude and arrogant and she never had a problem with me being gay. And that I was troubled because I had a somewhat troubled past. I got fed up and told her I was locking myself away because of her bad parenting skills and the fact she wasn’t raising me right. Am I the asshole?

Growing up in Canada, I had a great childhood (for an immigrant). My parents were in a lot of debt due to frequent trips back home and giving my sister and I a comfy childhood. However, my dad became overly religious. It has gotten to the point where I cannot remember a single conversation I have had with my dad that did not include religion. As I grew up, I resented the religion he followed for that reason and decided (mostly due to my education) that I am an agnostic/atheist. This is one of the secrets of my life. Without religion, I decided to still have a moral code of my own which includes not being TA.

&#x200B;

Now getting to my situation, my parents are close to retirement, have some but little debt and a no retirement plan. I am currently providing 90% of my salary to my mom. This has helped to get them out of debt. They have made it clear that they left our country for my sister and I's education (correct my grammar please) and expect me to support them in their retirement. In addition, the expect me to continue living with them, help around the house, pray 5 times a day and go to mosque every week. In a recent fight, they have made it clear that its either that or and I am roughly translating ""I will be forced leave the family because I am not getting out of my responsibilities that easily"".  I am definitely tired. I work six days a week, have school and get no peace at home. I am thinking of just leaving one day silently and moving out. However, I would leave them in a hell of a spot financially. I would like to add that I have another 6 year old sister that they expect me to help raise. I love her and is part of the reason I want to stay, Is it really right for me leave my responsibilities? Can I leave my younger sister in such a terrible spot? WIBTA for moving out of here?

TLDR: Immigrant parents have no retirement plan because they moved to Canada to give me a better life, Now that I am grown up, Can I leave them?

&#x200B;

E1. I want to thank everybody in advance for their opinion. I also wanna add that I plan on, if they let me, supporting them once I am financially good to do so if I move out."
1200,bb924b,"WIBTA if I tried to pursue a career in writing against my grandmother’s wishes? The age old question, really. Pursue your dreams, or settle with something safe?

I don’t believe I’ll be the next George RR Martin or anything. I’m not even planning on being a novelist. 

Proofreading, editing, copywriter, technical writer, etc. Something that, I would think, is reasonable. 

My grandmother, who raised me, doesn’t agree. She becomes upset whenever I bring it up, always has. 

I aspired for a career in writing since first grade. 

And the thing is, I’m actually fairly talented. I’ve placed first or second in every Art & Literature Fair I’ve entered. I’ve had numerous teachers from Elementary School through college tell me I should be a writer. I was first published at 15, and have been published three times. 

I don’t feel like I’m like the D-average kid who wants to be an astronaut. I’m not trying to be famous or make six-figures. I know that my life will be ordinary, and I’m fine with that.

But my grandmother insists, even now, even after I’ve tried and failed so many other career paths, writing is a dead-end job with no hope of success.

I’m 25 now. I’m tired of listening to her. I’m tired of her choosing new career paths for me that are “safe” but ultimately soul-sucking. 

I know she only wants what’s best for me. I know she wants me to have an okay life. I know she doesn’t want me to end up like my mother.

When I mentioned it last, her disappointment was palpable. Fists clenched, she said “you would be destitute.” 

“I already feel destitute,” I wanted to say.

Would I be an asshole to go against her and try to follow my lifelong dream?"
1201,d5b4rh,"AITA for banging on my neighbors wall? This is sort of a general question, but it does come with a story. TLDR at the bottom.

I have been having issues with my neighbor for 3 months. We share a wall in an apartment complex, my bedroom wall to be exact, and she insists on playing loud music all the time. Unfortunately it's very bassy so even if I put headphones in I can hear it. For a few weeks I let it slide because it was during the afternoon and while it was loud I didn't think it was particularly wrong.

We've had interactions before, none of them very pleasant and I'm moving forward with some solutions. I've talked to her, her roommate, my landlord, and the police. People in charge understand it is an issue and asked me to just let them know when it happens during quiet hours, which go from 10 PM to 8 AM.

Honestly, and the neighbor playing the music knows this, the bass noise gives me extreme anxiety. It's gotten to the point that if I hear it at say 10 in the morning my 2 options are go ask her to turn it down (which results in her telling me it's the middle of the day and to put in headphones) or just not be in my room.

Last night I come home from work at 11:50 PM and there's music. I was in no mood so after settling in and taking my time to get ready for bed, hoping it would stop, it hadn't. So instead of going and knocking on the apartment door I banged on the wall we share 2 times. I legit heard her get up and come to the wall to bang multiple times louder than me. I called non-emergency since this was outside of quiet hours but they hadn't come 30 minutes later, which is when she finally turned the music off so I called back to tell them not to come.

Sorry for all the backstory, but TLDR the main question is AITA for banging on the wall of my neighbors apartment to signify she needed to turn down the music? Is that a normal thing to do when someone plays loud music? Should I have gone to the door and knocked instead?"
1202,dkv8me,"WIBTA if I cut my mother off financially Here's the deal. My family has always been poor. I'm talking like food stamps, mother regularly pawns her wedding ring and then buys it back, taking out payday loans for any minor financial crisis poor.

For information's sake, my father, the primary income earner of our household, is emotionally abusive, and demands to be entertained whenever he is off work at night by going out to eat, often garnering $70 checks, and also smokes a lot of weed and drinks often. If he doesn't get the money/things he wants, he becomes belligerent, breaks things, threatens outlandish things (like quitting his job), actually took his stuff and moved out for a couple days at one point... It's definitely complicated.

My mother and I are very close. Since my father has the personality and emotional tolerance of a toddler, I ended up being her confidant when finances got bad, and knew the importance of covering my own expenses through high school. I often went without things, willingly, because that was what needed to happen.

Right now, I am a freshman in college attending on full financial aid/scholarship. I worked some throughout high school and was very dedicated to both saving money, because I know things are very stressful financially, and working hard to get into a good school so I could advance socially and get out of that situation. As part of my package, I got about $3000 in cash from my school to go towards books, supplies, cost of living, winter clothes, etc. My plan was to save as much as I can, simply because that's how I am.

That said, my mother has access to my checking account (I made it at 16, and at our bank I was required to have an adult on my account), where my scholarship money is. The issue comes into the fact that she has currently transferred about half my scholarship into her bank account in the last 45 days. I went home this weekend and she said this morning that she would transfer some money back to me. However, I just checked my bank account and she instead took another $200 out.

I've loaned my mom money in the past, but she always tells me and pays me back promptly, and it's never been this much money. It's to the point I'm starting to become really uncomfortable and worried that I won't be getting my money back. I'm also a bit confused, since I'm not living at home, she should logically be spending less money since my family is paying $0 to attend school. That said, I know that my father is only demanding more and more of her, and she's currently having some major health problems. She normally works a full time and a part time job, mostly to deal with his bullshit, but she isn't able to work the part time at the moment because of her health.

My question is, WIBTA if I demanded that she stop taking money, even though it would cause her to endanger her health and likely escalate tensions with my father?

edit: Based on the urging of literally every person who's commented thus far, I've applied for a separate savings account at my same bank (where I will be sole account holder), so I can immediately transfer my money to that. Looking forward, I'll consider a credit union or another bank, but this is easiest for the time being

edit 2: okay, so after talking it over with a few people who know a couple particulars of the situation that I'm not comfortable sharing on Reddit, here's my new plan: along with the new savings account at the same bank, I'm going to make a new checking account at a completely separate bank, which has a branch on campus and no branch back home. I will, obviously, not tell my family. I'm going to keep the joint account open for the time being so not to cause trouble, but take the vast majority of the money out of it. To do that, I'm going to use checks (like actual paper ones), and say that I've made some purchase/paid a fee with it, but just cash it and deposit the money into the new checking account at the new bank. I know that probably seems excessive, but that way, she thinks the money is gone-gone, and not just moved around. Thank you, to everyone, for your advice"
1203,bfj4ds,"AITA for being on my phone while my friend vented about her BF for the 1000th time? Last weekend I saw my friend (we’re both 23F if it matters). She’s been in a toxic and all-consuming, on again off again relationship for 6 years. We met Friday night just the two of us, and Saturday night with two other mutual friends. 

Friday night was just the two of us. We got drinks and I listened to her talk about her relationship troubles. I do my best to give thoughtful advice but she’s been having the same problems with him for years, and it’s almost all she ever talks about. (We hardly ever talk about my problems, and when we do she dismisses my feelings pretty quickly). Regardless, i listened to her and we had a thoughtful talk that night.

Then the next night we got dinner with two other mutual friends. I was looking forward to talking with everyone, but only a few minutes after being seated she brings up her BF problems to the others. I figured since we just talked about this last night and it was the exact same story, she wasn’t really talking to me, but to the others. I already said everything I could say the other night so I just turned away and went on my phone to let her talk to them. This conversion went on for literally the entire meal, so I was a little upset, I may have sighed a little here or there. Other than that, I just left them to talk about it and stayed on my phone. 

Fast forward through this last week. She has ignored my multiple messages, asking what’s wrong, etc, until I finally got an answer out of her in which she said “I don’t think we can support each other. I don’t want to hang out, or get in to why.” 

We then proceeded to have a huge fight over phone call where she called me bitchy, questioned my life choices, saying she wouldn’t ever take my advice because “this isn’t some random tinder guy I’m fucking” (a dig at me). She claims I huffed and puffed and rolled my eyes the entire meal. I have no recollection of the eye rolling, I may have let out a sigh or two, but certainly wasn’t trying to be obvious. I felt pretty ignored, I’m surprised anyone even noticed me there.

Now she’s decided, that because of my behavior at this one dinner, we can’t be friends. Side note, she’s leaving the friendship when I’m in the middle of a lot of heavy problems of my own. 

So guys, AITA for this dinner situation?"
1204,bbbltm,"AITA for freaking out over my mother’s texts. A little backstory, this happened a few weeks ago over spring break. Since I was on break for a week I was sleeping in till about 2 PM. One day I woke up three texts from my mother “I need you to call me ASAP!!!!! VERY IMPORTANT!!!!!” 10:20AM “Turn off your extended absence message NOW. I’ve asked you to before.” 11:35AM and “CALL ME!!!!!!” 1:25PM. When I saw this I immediately called my mom 3 times to no answer so I called her office then my dad and his office to no answer. I waited about an hour with complete radio silence until it began to get to me. I started calling around to or family members trying to find out if anything had happened to them or if anyone knew where they were and nobody knew anything. I then moved to their colleagues (they work at the same place) who had also not seen either of them that day. In all I probably called 3 colleagues and 3 family members without getting any information about anything. Some extra context my grandfather had had a heart attack just a few days before so as a person who already worries a lot my family’s health was already on my mind. At this point the people I had called had begun to text and they were now worried about where my parents were. Well it turned out it was a trivial matter and they strolled in a couple hours later. As soon as they walked in I asked if they were both ok to which they responded yes and then I got angry at them for making me worry so much. When I explained that I had called a bunch of people my mom got mad at me because “it was clear there was no emergency”. So my question is AITA for being “to worried” about my parents health.

1205,dbhs1d,"AITA for not changing my tattoo based on my childs pronouns? Throwaway for obvious reasons. Basically I [M42] got tattoos of the names of all 3 of my children. I got them going down my arm and they read from top to bottom (not actual names) ""Andy, Sara, Kate"". I had these tattoos all done at once after Kate was born knowing she would be my last. My oldest child Andy[T22] came out as trans and has decided she only goes by female pronouns now. My wife[F41] immediately supported her and made sure that I would too without any arguement or else she would divorce me. It was a huge family issue for a while but eventually it was solved and everything has been good for the last little while. I'm slowly learning more and trying to accept my daughter and her new pronouns and her name change to Athena. 

The problem arose yesterday when my wife and Athena sat down with me and told me there was an issue. The tattoo going down my arm still reads ""Andy"" and not ""Athena"" and my wife claims this is hurting our daughter and putting a strain on our relationship. My wife told me she wants me to get it touched up to correct it but I explained to her tattoos  don't work like that and you can't just change ""Andy"" to ""Athena"". I told her I would most likely need laser tattoo removal surgery and then would need to pay the cost of a brand new tattoo which I can not afford either of. I explained how my tattoo is such a non issue that I don't understand why this needs to be brought up now. Athena yelled at me and called me a shitty father and said if I don't support who she is, I just need to leave her life. My wife threatened to go stay with her parents with the kids if I don't ""get my act together"". I personally don't see the reason to change the tattoo and this feels like a bigger problem then it should be.

So im basically wondering if im the asshole in this situation."
1206,bji2aw,"WIBTA if I'm honest with a friend of mine about how his new girlfriend sees him? My boy J is a little too green for this earth. He's always getting into the shittiest relationships because he feels sorry for the girls, or he's just taken in by the T&A. It's happening again and I want to stop it before he gets hurt.

My girlfriend is part of a chat group from her sorority days that has J's girlfriend too (let's call her K). Now K apparently has been alluding often to how J is his play toy and she can manipulate him sexually into getting her way. The latest, and the one that ticked off my girlfriend and me was how he was planning on canceling a trip to Mexico for vacation because his car needed some urgent repairs. But apparently, and these are her words, ""K managed the situation, saved the vacation, and there's nothing that a few good blowjobs can't resolve."" Mind you, I know, K's completely broke, in student debt, and J isn't that well off either. Besides a paid off car, and a few thousands in savings, he doesn't have much. (He has a steady income.)

I didn't like the tone of the comment and I'm not going to rat out my girlfriend's group. But I'm concerned and want to be honest with him. My gf thinks that that's a bad idea and he needs to resolve this with K directly, not with me in the picture. But I know J and he's the sort of gullible fool that turns his life around for the right girl and I don't want that happening to him.

1207,eelq01,"AITA For Saying All I Really Want for Christmas is No Christmas? Long story short, I stopped really liking Christmas by the time I was about 10 because I was the child of divorce and my parents and step-parents decided that instead of alternating or asking me what I wanted that I would spend my Christmases divided among everyone. Like 4 dinners over two days, no time to enjoy gifts or really hang out. Just go, go, go.

Then I had my children young, and poor, and alone. Christmas has been financially and emotionally draining for the last 23 years.

There have been years that I saved all year to make Christmas stress free, only to have dental emergencies or a housing crisis wipe it out in November. I have tried buying gifts throughout the year, only to have them stolen or destroyed in a flood.

This year I was the sole income at home, my SO had cancer, my son was unemployed after leaving an abusive relationship, and yet again the pressure is on to buy or make gifts, NOW, when we are just catching up.

He asked me if I could have anything I want for Christmas what would it be. I said ""I want to be released from Christmas. I want to not feel obligated or pressured. I want to be left alone and not guilted. I don't want a card or a present I have to reciprocate. I want one year of no fucking Christmas. After decades of being miserable during the holidays, I want one for me.""

He looked at me like I had just murdered Santa in front of him. AITA?

EDIT to clarify my son is 23 and could not care less about Christmas, it was partner (M38) who asked what I wanted."
1208,cnhpdz,"AITA for not going to my mom's funeral? A quick note: my father dipped when I was about 2, and left my mom to raise me, my little sister, and my three older brothers by herself.

Right before my sixteenth birthday (I'm currently 27) my mom found out via my school's student counselor that I'm a lesbian. She was pretty upset over the whole thing and we got into a fight that ended with her demanding that I either leave or I submit myself to conversion therapy. I decided that it was best for me to go, packed my stuff up, and bought a plane ticket (in cash) to go from Arizona to Maryland. 

While in Maryland, I supported myself, never once hearing from my mother, brothers, or sister. While in college, I ended up in the same class as one of my maternal cousins, and I told her why I hadn't been at any of the family reunions, in Christmas cards, or at our aunt's wedding. She was very sympathetic and through her, I was able to contact my siblings again. 

A year ago, my sister called me to let me know that our mother was ill, and possibly dying. At the time, I didn't have the money to fly out to see her, so my sister paid for me to go. Even after my sister introduced me, my mother didn't even recognize me. It was like I'd never existed to her. She'd either forgotten about me or blocked any memory of her 'living disappointment' (her words, not mine) from her memory. 

A month ago, my sister called to let me know that our mother had passed away, and I received an invitation to her funeral.

I didn't go.

My eldest brother is upset with me for not being able to 'move on'. Am I the asshole?"
1209,duzzu2,"AITA for getting my cleaner fired? So I am currently living with my boyfriend where I have my own separate room. As long as I can remember he has had cleaners in the house 2 times a month for a couple of hours. We often go out in the morning for work, let her in and she cleans. It has always been the same woman coming. For some reason she quit her job and they reassigned the job to clean our apartment to a new girl.

The problems started from the very first cleaning with the new girl. She had opened a window in the bathroom and left a bunch of stuff on the window sill, including a glass container. Which dropped from the sill and shattered in the bathroom when the window opened from a draft. The second cleaning she did, 2 weeks later, she put our pans so hard on one another that the teflon broke from the pans. So by this cleaning I am sceptical of this girl. The third time she comes I'm working from home to check what she's up to when she is cleaning. Everything went good and thought maybe it was some coincidence that all this stuff was happening. 

The fourth, and last time, she comes (late) and we leave the house to go for work. Around lunch I get a text saying ""Hey, sorry I was late, I stayed a little bit longer and took the opportunity to wash your clothes."" So by now I'm having a heart attack and thinking what I have in my basket. During the three years we've had cleaners in the house - they never washed our clothes. I tell her ""Cool thank you see you next time"", whatever. Come home just to find out she basically washed the clothes on a too high temperature so the clothes got smaller. One of my silk shirts basically shrunk one whole size and teared in the wash. 

I get upset because I often buy good clothes and pick them out based on quality. So fast forward a couple of days and I send a complaint to the company via email. I tell them the incidents we had with the cleaner and asked to be recompensed for the clothes and for her to be swapped with another more experienced cleaner for the next time. 

This night I get an angry call from the cleaner, telling me what an asshole I am and that she lost her job because of the complaint. She starts by asking me what shirts got smaller and tells me to pack them so she can go by and buy new ones. I tell her ""No"" and also tell her that I think it's inappropriate to call the end-customer and that she should have the discussion with her boss not me. She then looses it and says that the clothes basically looked like trash to begin with. I explain that we never had our clothes washed before and that I pick out my clothes with care so she simply cannot go out and buy me new clothes for 500 USD just because the ones she washed got smaller. 

AITA here? I think the company handled it bad to show her the email I wrote, directly to her, instead of taking it with her and explaining the complaint from us, the customer. In my opinion the people they hire should have protocol of what to do or not to do when cleaning."
1210,c0lja4,"AITA for losing my temper? Hello fellow Reddit Babes.

I'm on mobile and Yada Yada. 

So for some background I have a very entitled older sister (28) and she and her husband live at home with my parents. Because I'm a Muslim I can only movie out once I'm married so that's why I still live with my parents. She hasn't moved out because they are in a comfort zone and my father pays for everything while they live their lives and act broke. They've been married for 6 years BTW. 

Anyway on to the story. My sister treats my younger brother and I like absolute garbage. She has insults us at every opportunity she gets especially in public and she's just a very nasty person. So she needed to go pick something up today and didn't want to go alone because she was taking her baby (3) with her. I politely declined as I don't help the hand that bites me. Anyway she created a performance and was being rude and demanded that my brother(15) went with instead and my father started shouting at my brother. So I got involved and I told my dad that it's not fair that he gets agressive with us because she wants something and we need to suddenly jump to help that's not how this works. So this started a very aggressive argument between my dad and I. She eventually went alone with the kid.

A lot of people are going to call me selfish and whatever but it's not like that. If she treated us different and was actually a nice person I would have loved to go. My dad always enables her bullshit and that's just not on. Don't treat me like dirt and then expect me to help you.

So am I the asshole?"
1211,d9fep2,"AITA if I don’t go to my best friend’s wedding at a plantation due to my girlfriend being black? My best friend of 8 years is getting married to a woman in the Deep South. She is dead set on the ceremony being at a plantation near her hometown, as is tradition in her family. The plantation owners had slaves, way back when. My best friend has always said he’d like me to be the best man, but hasn’t explicitly asked me in awhile. I’d always say, “Yes, of course.”

Putting my own feelings about plantations aside, my girlfriend of 2 years is South Sudanese. By her words, she is the “kind of black that still bothers some white people.” Whenever we’ve gone to the South, she feels as though people stare and treat her differently. I told her where the wedding is, and while she’d never say she doesn’t want to go, I know her well enough to know she would be super uncomfortable. The plantation would make it worse.

AITA if I don’t go to my best friend’s wedding? Am I still the asshole if I go and *don’t* take my girlfriend of two years

Edit:
I talked to my girlfriend about her thoughts on the manner. They were pretty much what I thought: she admitted she thinks it is an inappropriate place for a wedding, and she still dislikes this particular area of the South we’d be going to. She, as I expected, still said she’d go with me if I went."
1212,cme916,"WIBTA for asking my neighbors to stop having their guests buzz my apartment? I live in an apartment complex and I just so happen to live in the apartment that shares the same number as the building's street number ie. my address is 67 Maple Street, Apartment 67.

We have a buzzer system at the front door that has apartment number but no names listed next to the buzzer. You have to press and hold the button in order to speak with the apartment itself, which is too complicated for most people. We do not have a concierge and someone has to come down and open the door to let you in, we cannot open it from the apartment.

Every day, at least once, my neighbors' guests buzz my apartment or they forget to put an apartment number so the delivery person buzzes me. This is annoying, because the buzzer is loud (and causes my dogs to bark) and nearly every time even if I talk to them through the intercom they don't get the hint and keep buzzing me and not the right apartment.

I don't know everyone in the building so I can't always redirect them and it's a pain in the ass to have to come downstairs multiple times a night sometimes to be like ""you've got the wrong apartment.""

I want to type and print a polite note telling people to tell their guests the correct apartment number and tape it to the door. 

My wife disagrees, she thinks that's passive aggressive and an asshole move since the neighbors aren't the ones at fault here, but I just had someone buzz us 15 times in 25 minutes until I had to go downstairs and tell them to fuck off.

1213,dp1tho,"AITA for not seeing my birth mom at all? Hey everyone..


Some background on the title. I was taken away from my birth mom as a baby because she was on drugs. I was placed into several foster homes until my dad got custody of me finally. 

She appeared in my life a few times throughout my childhood, and since I was a child, I didn’t pay much attention as to why she wasn’t in my life that much.

Well, my father died back in 2011, and my real mom and my step-mom (I guess she’s just my guardian now since she isn’t married to my dad for obvious reasons) fought over me for about 4 years. Visitations were set up for my real mom because she “desperately wanted me to be with her”.

After I turned 13, my step-mom said I could make decisions for myself. I stopped seeing my real mom as it was putting a strain on me and my step-mom. Not only that, but I just felt awkward being around her as she wasn’t really there for me a whole lot, and I still can’t forgive her for what she’s done to me over the years. 

Now i’m 16, trying to figure out if what i’m doing is right or wrong. Some people (like my brother) said that I’m being too harsh because “without her I wouldn’t be here”z Some people (like my friends) say it’s okay if I don’t go, because she was toxic.

1214,elq1lv,"AITA for blowing up at my in laws and wife over them trying to ruin our vacation plans? My wife and I have 2 kids (4f & 2f). We moved to another country about a year ago and have been living here ever since. When in our home country, both families were very involved in our lives due to my kids being the only grandchildren on both sides. Us moving overseas caused my in laws to feel as if we were abandoning them and they will lose the bond they have with their grandkids and we only doing it for the money and not thinking about them. So we agreed during summers we will send the kids back home for about 6 weeks to spend time with both grandparents.

In September my wife and I explored the idea of going for a vacation without the kids to reconnect and be a couple again. We discussed and she agreed that it will be good for us. We then speak to my inlaws and explain to them when and why we want to go for our solo holiday. They were very excited at the prospect of spending time with the kids so all seemed well. Now, knowing that my in laws can be very reactionary people I told them to think about it and we will discuss again in a few days time. We call them 3 days later and discuss and they of the same mindset. As i said i know how reactionary they can be so i brought it up with them every 2 or 3 days  for about a month which is ALOT of discussion around the same subject. I wanted to make sure all is fine. This is what we agreed to:

1. Wife and kids will fly home late December to leave the kids and to get the kids used to the grand parents again and vice versa
2. Wife will return late Jan so she can spend some time here and do some things she wanted to do without having to worry about the kids
3. Early Feb wife and I will depart for Bali after which we will go to home country to spend some time
4. So in total, we will be leaving the kids in their care for 4 weeks

On Monday my in laws ask her if she is serious about leaving the kids for so long and that they are worried that the kids won't manage and she must push her flight later so the kids only spend the minimum amount of time without us - they want her to fly back only a day or two before we leave for vacation as opposed to the 2 weeks that has been planned and paid for. She called me on Monday night to talk to me about it and said that she AGREES with them I. Lost. My. Shit. I demanded a conference call with her parents straight away and basically let them have it for emotionally manipulating my wife. I said if they try and demand this I will take my kids with us to Bali and they can forget about us ever leaving the kids with them again and I will not be sending them down over the summers. I said I will not ask them for anything ever again and called them assholes for not keeping to the agreement even though we discussed it more than 20 times.I told my wife this is bullshit as she was fine with the arrangements whenever we discussed it.

1215,cg3u5v,"AITA for not splitting the $100 I got for referring my sister to her job? I'll try to keep this short.

My job has a referral program where you get $100 for referring someone there after they complete their training. My sister was looking for a job and she asked me what she would need to do to work for the company I'm at. I put her down the right path and after she did her interview she told me that she heard about the referral program and she put me down as a reference so that she and I can split the money.

I told her I appreciate her doing that but that's not how it works. ""It's a referral bonus. I referred you, I should get the bonus. If you want a referral bonus all you have to do is refer someone and you're good.""

That clearly didn't dit well with her because she started screaming at me saying she doesn't know how I can live with myself being such a greedy psycho, that I'm mentally unstable, etc. I just left before it got any worse and we haven't talked since. 

Either way I think she's an asshole for the way she talked to me, but am I the asshole for not splitting the money in the first place?"
1216,cqbbkv,"AITA for doing my roommates dishes even though he says he’ll do them? I live in a house with two other guys(R1&R2). We’re all 27. For the most part it’s pretty chill. We’ve all been friends since we were in high school and get along pretty well. The only point of contention is everyone’s different level of cleanliness. 

R2 is fairly clean, he doesn’t make much of a mess, and uses mostly disposable plates, silverware, etc.(not the best for the environment, but whatever) R1 is a different story though. I’ve never met a more unclean person before. He lived in this house for like 5 years before I moved in, and it was disgusting. It took me like 2 weeks to get it to a passable state, and it still needs a serious deep clean. 

But the biggest issue is dishes. R1 never does them. We’ve had a real problem with ants in our kitchen. They eat off of the food left in uncleaned dishes in the sink. We’ve talked about this, so he knows it’s a problem. 

R1 comes home, makes a huge mess in the kitchen(because he’s hungry and tears through food when he’s here), claims he’ll do the dishes, then leaves to spend the night at his girlfriends house. Therefore his dishes never get done. 

I’ve started just doing his dishes for him. We’re not 20 anymore, I want to live like an adult, and sorry but having a kitchen over run by dirty dishes and ants isn’t part of that. 

So every time R1 comes home, he sees I did his dishes from the day before. He gets all huffy saying “you did the dishes again? You shouldn’t have to do that, *i’ll* get them!” I know he won’t, and since I’ve been doing the dishes, our ant problem has stopped. 

But he’s taking a personal offense over this. AITA?"
1217,d1fbva,"AITA for not wanting to apply for the ""school"" my parents want? Before I begin I'd like to clarify something: I have graduated high school this year so the term ""school"" instead of university in this case would only make sense if you're basically French or know about their system of education.

 What I'm reffering to here are  ""preparatory classes"", which basically serve as a 2 year preparatory cycle to get ready for entrence exams for what is referred to as big universities. Now that we got that out of the way, I'll explain my situation :

My parents have forced me to apply for these classes despite me not wanting to do that, for the record I have been accepted to a business university and an engineering one. Bit they still refused to let me get into either one of them because it's for my own good, that wouldn't be a problem except for the system these kind of schools have: It's really fucking strict, you'd have to take 8 hours just for classes a day, couple that with hard material, exams every single week, almost regular interrogations where the teacher would pick a few students after the course has ended for a "" test"" which is described as a way of putting pressure on students so thy study regularly, and to top it all off the teachers in the school I have been made to attend are like total dicks, they will destroy your psyche and don't even give the full courses so that you go and pay them for extra hours in the evening! (Real life MACROtransactions basically).

 All that so that you take entrance exams for ""the best"" universities, by the way if you fail it, you're done for, and to make matters even worse, since I only live in a country where this system has only been brought from France, that means that the amount of people who pass here is substantially less than those who do there, even if you score better than someone in France, you still might fail. And if you do, unless you're recommended by the teachers to restart the final year once. Tough luck!

As for the best universities thing, my sister graduated from one of them and now she works for an offshore company for like 522$ a month, so there's that. And now my parents have already made me apply and keep guilt tripping me and make me look like a no good lazy bum who doesn't want to do any effort whenever I try to tell them I don't want it, which kinda made me feel like that's the truth. So am I the asshole here?"
1218,e73zmg,"AITA for refusing to come home? My partner and I had a massive blue yesterday because I am staying the week at my parents house. He has spent the last week in Melbourne doing training for his apprenticeship and as he had been ill we had organised for our twin daughters (6 weeks old tomorrow) and I to stay an extra week. 

I have been really struggling the last few weeks and have been getting progressively worse, to the point I passed out from exhaustion when I arrived here last Monday. 

As a young first time mum (20yo) who for all intents and purposes is taking care of them on my own, especially as he is returning to work this week, having the guidance from my stepmother has made the last week bearable and we have plans to work on ways of settling the girls and making it easier for me when I return home. 

They have also had health issues this last week which had made them very unsettled and all they want is to be held. 

The issue is that he insists I come home today now that he is suddenly feeling better and is home. I understand that he has missed the girls and I, as I have missed him, but when I attempted to explain to him that I still wished to spend the week here for all of the reasons mentioned above he became furious at me and it dissolved into an argument. 

I suggested that he come and stay as well but he dislikes my family and refuses to stay, he doesn’t even want to come visit us here. He says that he will take an extra week off of work to help me as I wanted to stay where I had help till they were last the 6 week growth spurt when everybody says things get easier, but it is the last of his annual leave and he needs it there in case something happens and I do need him at home. 

He is also mad as he believes that I should be working this out on my own without guidance from my parents but he rarely lifts a hand to help look after the girls,  not to mention doing anything around the house. 

I don’t want to upset him but I also know that I cannot come home yet as I know that nothing will change and I will be on my own again through this difficult week."
1219,b984mf,"AITA for not allowing an ex-housemate into my current house? The usual mobile formatting disclaimer applies. 

Okay, so I (21F) currently live with my partner (21M) in a house by ourselves. Last year we were sharehousing with another couple (21F, 21F). 

I used to be friends with the other couple who will be referred to as N and D. During our time sharing, our friendship sort of broke down. They treated my boyfriend very badly, told me I was too good for him, and were consistently hypocritical in what they expected him to do, vs what they would do (e.g. they wanted him to clean the lounge when it was their stuff, they would expect him to do things that they wouldn't do, clean the showers, etc) . 

Before we moved in, I was very close with N, and after we moved out, I was willing to give her another chance as a friend, with the understanding that she could dislike my partner, but any negative thoughts she had about him would be kept to herself or I'd leave. 

I also said I'd try to mend our friendship, but she'd still not be welcome in my house, simply because my partner is not comfortable with her being in his home, and I side with him (my logic is that he pays rent, so he gets a say in who comes in our home). 

However, our wider friendship circle (who we kept out of the conflict because we didn't want them to feel like they had to choose sides) has started to comment on the fact that I never invite N to our hangouts and called me an ass. 

I feel like I'm respecting my partner's boundaries and his wishes about who comes in the house that he helps pay for. 

So Reddit, AITA for not letting someone that makes my partner uncomfortable in our shared home? "

So to set this up, my wife and I share an Amazon Prime account. It was originally mine before we got married and has now become ours because we don't feel the need to pay for two accounts. We also use shared bank accounts and treat all of the money that we make individually as ""our money."" We trust each other to be responsible and most of the time, this hasn't been an issue.

However, yesterday she came to me to let me know that she has agreed to allow her work to make several purchases using our Amazon Prime account so that they can receive free, quick shipping on several items. These items are to be used as prizes for her office in some upcoming work-related festivities (puzzles, word searches, games, etc.). They will be using a company cr

She informed me that she had offered this in a planning meeting yesterday. I told her I was not comfortable with her using our account for this purpose. I told her that her company was using her (and us) for our account and if they would like to receive Amazon Prime benefits, then they should use their own account. I told her that it is not our responsibility to foot the bill to make up for their limited budget and poor planning.

My wife disagrees, stating that this does not cost us any more than we are already paying for the account. Furthermore, she believes that by helping stretch the budget, they are able to do more for her coworkers to make their lives better. She also says that we have shared other accounts with friends and family members so doing this for her work should be no different.

I disagree and we have never shared our Amazon account with anyone. We have shared our Hulu and HBO access with our parents and a few select friends.

Things got a little more heated in this argument, but I eventually caved and said she could do it just this one time. She also said that it would be around $60-70.

Today, I checked the account and it was closer to $300.... So am I the asshole for not wanting to share our private Amazon Prime benefits with my wife's work?

My girlfriend has been placed in the hospital for well over 3 weeks due to a rare disease called chrons. It has swollen her intestines to where only liquid could pass through. This made it really hard for her to eat solids, and it still is. Even today if she tried to eat a solid, she would either be in extreme pain or puking it up. 

       My mom and I had planned to see her yesterday and she wanted to get cookies. I said it was a very bad idea because My GF can’t eat cookies. It seemed like she wanted to make it more about the parents, than my GF. After all it was my GF who was hospitalized, not them.

       I’m not saying it was a bad gesture, it just had merely bad timing. My GF could had not been able to eat solids for weeks now and had always reminded me of how starving she was. So I saw it as an extremely poor choice on my mother’s part to waltz into her room and give my GF’s mom cookies. She had before this, promised me my GF would not find out. 

      I had suggested that she waits until she can eat as well, so you could get two birds with one stone. She still would not listen to me. Prior to this, when my mom was getting the cookies, I told her it was a “f****** stupid idea”. Even my grandma seemed to agree.

1222,d7oikj,"AITA for not sucking it up and practising my parents religion that I don’t believe in Me (16F) and my sister (16F) were raised catholic, but nowadays we don’t consider ourselves religious. Catholics become ‘adults’ when they make confirmation, which we both made recently, although its supposed to be your choice, our parents pushed it on us. We were told our whole lives that after our confirmation we could attend mass when we wanted, but now as we are beginning to apply to sixth forms (junior and senior years to Americans) our parents are refusing to obtain certificates of catholic practise that are required for acceptance into catholic schools, as we aren’t going to weekly mass. I understand they don’t want to ask the priest for certs when we aren’t attending mass weekly (we go every few weeks) but the thing is, they won’t let us apply for non catholic sixth forms. 

Essentially, they won’t get us certs of catholic practise for us to get into catholic sixth forms unless we go to mass, but they won’t let us go to non catholic sixth forms. They claim that going to mass is our choice, but if we want to go to our chosen sixth forms, we need the cert.

If every teenager applying to catholic sixth forms needed to be attending mass weekly, no one would be accepted. My older sister and brother are both in their twenties now and went to catholic sixth forms, though they stopped attending mass at our age. Our parents don’t realise that if they force us to practise their faith, we’ll only draw back from it more, and they aren’t giving us any sort of choice. They think that they don’t ask much from us, and we should want to please them by going to mass as they work hard to be able to raise us.

We hit it off pretty quickly and had been chatting ever since. Recently we started to get pretty raunchy with our conversation.

Now he told me in advance that he didn't have any nude pictures of himself, but he did say that he'd be fine if I sent him mines, and I told him that was cool. So we message for a bit more, me sharing both nude and non-nude photos with him, chatting and having enjoyable little thing. Then in the heat of the moment, I asked him if he would be opposed to taking just a single shot of his stuff and send it to me.

Now I was mostly teasing, and was prepared to move on if he had said no (we were starting to make plans to eventually meet up and go on a date when he got back home from where he was staying.) but I noticed he took some time to respond... and when he did he completely blew up on me. He said that I was looking for a ""dishonest man"" and that he told me that he didn't have nudes from the beginning, and that I only wanted a guy who would show him his junk rather than a decent person. Then he told me to go ""f\*ck myself and reiterated that all I cared about was his privates, and that we really didn't know each other.

Me (31 F) & kids (2 F, 4 M) moved with my husband  (31 M) from where we met, married & had our children in California to Texas. We always said we would raise our kids in small town Texas where my husband grew up. It was his dream & I was happy to support him!
When we moved – to a house a few blocks away from his parents – we thought we would be getting some help from his parents with the kids. They babysat the oldest twice in 8 months. They showed very little interest in the kids but had my husband over multiple times a week doing things for them (they are in their 60s & in good health) & did come over to dinner a few times. He adored his parents & they adored him. Their only child. Their golden boy. 

My husband was diagnosed with a rare cancer that was terminal earlier in the year. He died within 5 weeks of diagnosis. It was tragic & I am still in shock. When he was dying he was in a great deal of pain & on morphine & wasn’t always coherent or thinking straight. However he told me his parents were devastated I would move the kids back to where I grew up in Canada & they wouldn’t be able to watch the kids grow up. Well…that was my exact plan. My parents are the most amazing grandparents & help my sister out a lot (2 days a week of full babysitting!) & would do the same for me. Canada has a great education & healthcare system & my siblings & parents are live near each other so the kids and I would have a support network.

I lied to my husband. I told him I would stay & raise the kids as Texans as we had planned. He was in so much pain & distress & I couldn’t add to it. I chose the easy way out.

2 weeks after the funeral I moved my sweet babies home to Canada. My parents in law are now telling everyone I betrayed a dying man’s last wish.

I however am only 16 so I cannot be classed a ""leader"" but a ""Young Leader"". I have took many courses to go volunteer as a young leader at scouts. From first aid to how to deal with bullying and depression in the group, I have invested my life into this Scout group (10 years!) 
However recently the Group Scout Leader passed away. The GSL basically controls every section of the group (beavers, cubs and the scouts).  After he passed away, his position was transferred to the Beaver Leader. This is the ONLY time I have disliked being in the group. After he passed, my position as a Young Leader has decayed. I have no authority over the scouts, the scouts make a joke of me and I cannot ""mingle"" with the 3 older leaders there.

On Christmas Eve, my girlfriend (24F) and I (21M) went to dinner at her parents house. The entire family is over, so numerous aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins, etc. all of which I have met before. It was overall decent with a few minor incidents but that’s mostly irrelevant. After dinner and dessert were long done, and guests started to leave, my girlfriend and I were looking at what was left on the dining room table and decided to try some small watermelon slices. It wasn’t homemade or anything, but rather in a store-bought plastic container. Gf goes first, stabbing a piece with her fork and eating it. She describes how juicy and tasty it is, so I go in for a piece myself. Not bad, we each go to try another when suddenly gf’s mom loudly says, “Uh, I hope you two aren’t eating that straight out of the container!” from across the entire room, opposite side of the dining room table making a huge scene, causing everyone to immediately look our way. Gf and I stopped and apologized, I took the blame saying I was the culprit, and apologized again.

Whatever, everyone goes back to their conversations and leaving, etc., until not even 10 minutes later, I shit you not, gf’s mom sits down right in front of the container of sliced watermelon and eats multiple pieces with her bare hands, straight out of the container.

You’ve got to be kidding me. How hypocritical to put my gf and I on the spot for doing a seemingly harmless act of trying 2 pieces of fruit with our forks, and then she has the audacity to eat it right out of the container as if that’s not what she just made a big deal about. So when I get home, I tell my parents about it and my dad says she’s a hypocrite too, however my mother says my gf and I are the assholes for using our forks to taste the watermelon.

If you have a couple drops of milk left in the gallon and want to finish it, do you get a clean glass and pour the 4-5 drops into the cup, or do you just finish off the gallon by drinking straight out of it?

First off, just a little background. My (18F) boyfriend (19M) have been together for going on two years now. We're both in college and we both live with our own parents. However, I hit some rough times with my family and I lived with his family (and paid rent to them) from April 2018-November 2018 until I patched things with my parents and moved back home. My BF's parents have always been really, really controlling. Anytime he wants to do something that they don't like, they threaten to not pay for his college (that they pay a whopping $1k a year for, thanks to the many scholarships my BF earned). Keep this in mind, its relevant a little later.

&#x200B;

Now fast forward to today. My BF and I took my younger brother to a ""fancy"" grocery store near us to get some muffins that my brother really likes for brunch. We bought a 4 pack and my brother ate his, but my BF and I brought the other 3 back to his house. We accidentally left them on the kitchen counter for a few hours, so I asked my BF to go grab them. He saw that someone had eaten one that I had already taken a bite out of and I’m sick with a cold, so he just asked who had eaten it and apparently his younger (14F) sister had. NBD, right? We had an extra one anyway. So he came back upstairs with the two remaining muffins, handed them to me, told me what had happened, then walked to the bathroom. A minute or two later, his mother comes storming upstairs, screaming. She barges in and starts screaming at me. This is how the conversation went:

&#x200B;

Mother: *sister* is in her room crying because you were mean to her

Me: Why are you screaming at me? What's going on?

Mother: Here's your fucking two dollars for the fucking muffin, bitch. \*THROWS money at me\*

Me: What's going on??? Why are you yelling at me?? \*Throws money back at her\*

Mother: Ungrateful bitch.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I forgot to mention, that by this point, I was uncontrollably sobbing for some reason. I think I was just overwhelmed by what was going on and I felt so disrespected by the money throwing that I just burst into tears.

&#x200B;

At this point, BF comes back into the bedroom and tries to diffuse the situation. His mother continues to scream at him. From this point, it continued to escalate, but not really involving me. His dad comes up, screams at him about being disrespectful (neither of us had been disrespectful, and we're both confused as to why this is even happening), and threatens to stop paying for his car insurance and college. Not even threatened really, just said that he wouldn't pay either of those anymore. My BF and I left and went elsewhere, but now I've told him that I will not go back to his house at all until his mother apologizes to me. He's pissed off at me because he says that I'm making this worse for him because I'm putting him in the middle. So, reddit, AITA?

&#x200B;

TL;DR: BF's little sister ate something of ours, asked about it, mom flipped screamed at me even though I had nothing to do with it and now I want her to apologize. BF is mad at me and thinks that I should just get over it.

“L” worked for Mom and became like “another daughter” to her and a “sister” to me.

Mom died 7 years ago from cancer. She became a shell of herself over the last few months and I admittedly dissociated myself somewhat. I called daily and drove the 100 miles to see her every weekend, but only Saturday OR Sunday for a few hours. She spent most of the time sleeping so I just sat next to her hospice bed in her living room. I hated it. I didn’t want to be there. This was my mother and best friend and I couldn’t stand seeing her suffer. (I also had a husband and toddler at home and a full-time job.)

The Saturday before she died, my family and I went to my in laws’ for a family event. While there, L called with an update on Mom, then asked what I was doing and I was honest. When I called that night, K sarcastically asked if I’d had fun that day.

I went the next day and before I left, I hugged Mom and we had a brief, private exchange. It was the most awake and coherent she’d been in weeks and what she said to me was very special. I told K and the nurse to call my cell when they felt her death was imminent—I intended to try to be there. Tuesday was the last time I spoke with Mom and it was also when I reconsidered being there when she died. I realized how traumatic it would be and that I wanted my last real memory with her to be our embrace on Sunday. The decision was made for me though as the next phone call I got was from L Friday afternoon telling me Mom was gone. K had called my work number instead of my cell that morning (no one EVER called my work number, not even my husband) and I wasn’t at work.

After the funeral, I called K every month or two. Went to see him the first 2 Christmases and the first Mother’s Day weekend. L was at the first Christmas and we made loose plans for the Mother’s Day visit but she didn’t answer when I called her that day, nor did she call me back. It’s been 6+ years since I’ve talked to her. The last time I talked to K was when my son was born 5+ years ago. I left him messages 3 times over the months that followed. Finally, I spoke to my stepsister around Christmas and he was there so she tried handing him the phone, but he refused to take it.

I’ve clearly been cut off. My aunt confirmed my suspicion that L thinks I wasn’t around enough when Mom was dying. I’m sure that also plays into K’s actions but I also know he hates my brother who was bugging him for money around the time he stopped taking my calls, so being my brother’s sister also has something to do with it.

So AITA?"
1235,cxtlkl,"AITA: Not Forgiving my Father Rant Okay so after a huge argument with my mother. I am still trying to wrap my brain around this and was hoping maybe you guys can offer some insight.

In order to best understand the situation, allow me to tell you about my father. While never sexual, he was very physically and mentally abusive to me, my brother and my mother. For example He used to beat both me and my brother for an hour trying to get one of us to confess to not putting our laundry in the hamper. I hated him. I wouldn't have pissed on him if his heart was on fire. 

So when the fateful day came where he would not promise my mother to never lay a hand on her again she finally filed for divorce. FREE!!... or so I thought. Now, I NEVER fought with my mother before this. so it was completely alien when we began to and it was always over the same thing. To go and spend time with my father. Well he's the only father you'll ever have was always her argument. 

Once I was on my own, the fights stopped and I remained in good terms with the majority of the family and tried to build a life for myself. My father moved on as well and married another woman and even found forgiveness from my brother and my mother to a degree. Me, however, was a different story.

I rarely spoke to him afterwards and then came the day he came to ask me for forgiveness. (I'm sorry for forgiveness is just a word. When I see it in action then we'll talk.) I unleashed 17 years of torment upon him and being the man he was, began to take offense but tried to maintain his composure. I don't think he was prepared for the hurt I felt. Needless to say, I told him that at the very least this was not the time to ask me for forgiveness because I have to form this life called adult without any template that I NEEDED him to provide while growing up and hope I don't mess everything up. But I would be watching and if I feel he truly has changed for the better we may talk again.

Well I guess I didn't do too bad. Met a great person and when the news broke that we were expecting our first. I got that call I dreaded. True to my word, I had been keeping tabs on him. (The family grape vine is better than any news org out there.) Not much changed. Heck, he still hasn't even forgiven his own father. He still had to be right and would die on that hill to prove it. So no, IMO, he wasn't ready to be forgiven and I wasn't willing to risk our child. Then came what pissed me off the most. He drug the family into it and now I'm the bad guy because I refuse to allow him anywhere near our daughter.

Wait, so I'm unfair because he's getting exactly what he put us thru? I'm the bitch because his cries are falling on deaf ear despite how many years our cries fell on his deaf ears? Can someone explain this to me? Can someone explain if and why I'm the asshole in all of this?

&#x200B;

TLDR: Won't forgive abusive father and let him see his grand daughter. AITA?"
1236,b6q94s,"AITA for getting angry when my mom very seriously told me I should go to addicts anonymous meetings because I smoke marijuana? I’m almost 26, and I’ve been smoking weed since I was a teenager. 
I’ve never chosen weed over bills or rent, I’ve never done the stereotypical “I missed the big meeting/important job interview/etc because I was busy getting high!” Nonsense. I’ve easily been able to stop smoking for months at a time at the drop of a hat and feel nothing but maybe some slight boredom. I’m more addicted to cigarettes than to weed and I smoke maybe two cigarettes a day if even that much, and not even every day. 
My mom sat me down one day and very seriously told me that she thinks I need to consider going to an addicts anonymous meeting for my weed addiction. She had gone so far as to find websites and print up information for me and called a few meetings in the city nearby to find out if they had room for one more person. 
After the initial confusion and disbelief that it was a genuine suggestion, I was angry. I was offended. Not only at the fact that she would say that to me considering I remember multiple times when I was a teen that my mom would ask me if I had 5$ so she could buy cigarettes. A 35 year old woman asking her 15 year old daughter for cigarette money. And she refused to even try to stop smoking through all 4 of her kids pregnancies. And I told her as much, I said all of that to her face. 
And I told her that beyond that, how disgustingly offensive would it be for me to sit in a room listening to people tell stories about losing their children because of their addiction, becoming homeless, becoming estranged from their families etc and then I stand up and go “yeah I mean sometimes I choose smoking weed over like exercising and a couple of times I’ve taken a hit or two during lunch breaks on particularly shitty days at work” and expect to be welcomed back
She was very angry with me, it caused an argument that lasted several days and even now (maybe 6 months later) it’s still a touchy subject. She still brings it up sometimes and each time I immediately leave the room/hang up the phone/stop responding to her texts until she changes the subject. 
Was I in the wrong? Should I have been nicer about it? The idea just seemed so awful and entitled in some way, that I couldn’t believe it came from my otherwise usually rather intelligent and open minded mother (especially also considering her entire teens and 20’s were spent bar hopping and doing all sorts of drugs and partying with the type of fringe people who hank from hooks on chains nailed to the ceiling for fun). My boyfriend said he agreed with what I said fully, but thought maybe I should’ve just kept my mouth shut and just said no I’m not gonna do that rather than blowing up. "
1237,biyqpr,"AITA For Asking My Brother Not To Bring His Girlfriend Long lead up, so in advance I'm sorry.  I've been dating my girlfriend at university now for about six months. In the time we've been together, anytime we go to a party where she sees people from high school she gets visibly uncomfortable and shrinks into herself. She's usually such a smiley person, and it's disconcerting to see her get so somber. I've asked her before what was wrong, but she would always brush it off and say it wasn't worth dwelling on. Recently, she finally told me the story.

About half-way into her senior year, all of her close friends stopped talking to her. A full stop, they wouldn't sit with her in class or at lunch, wouldn't return any calls or texts, they all out ignored her. She was basically cut off from everyone she knew and went through a severe period of depression for several months. She ended up not going to graduation or prom, she stopped eating and almost exclusively hung out with some twenty-one-year-old college guy she was seeing at the time. She apparently didn't really get any friends again or talk to anyone aside from her parents until the second semester, because she couldn't bring herself to reach out to anyone.

Anyways, fast forward to her third year of school, and she saw one of the girls that have stopped talking to her at our university library. This girl explained more or less what happened in an attempt to apologize to my girlfriend. Apparently one of the girls in this close-knit group, Jenna, told the group that my girlfriend had verbally assaulted her, called her a horrible slut and threatened to physical harm to her. Jenna then gave them an ultimatum, saying that either she would leave the group and never talk to them again or they could stop talking to my girlfriend. 

Apparently, Jenna started doing this sort of thing a lot once they got to university, asking them not to hang out with people because they'd threatened her, intentionally damaging their relationships with roommates and friends, etc. Resulting in everyone realizing how manipulative she is. 

Now, this past week I went back home to see my parents and talk to them about an upcoming trip we have planned together (My girlfriend, brother and parents) When I got back home, I found out that my brother had come back the same weekend to introduce his new girlfriend to our mom and dad. You probably guessed by now who it is, none other than Jenna. He was introducing her to my parents so that he could ask if she could come on the trip with us. Now the long-awaited question: Am I an asshole for asking my brother not to bring this chick? I know my girlfriend would never ask me to do this, but Jenna tormented her, and I know that if Jenna goes then my girlfriend will be miserable the whole time.  My brother acted like I'd asked him to cut off his own arm, and started talking about how if anyone shouldn't go on the trip it should be my girlfriend because she's ""the one with the problem."""

1239,eh1eik,"AITA for moving me and my sister’s table after some lady tried to sit with us in a public space? me (22f) and my younger sister (17f) spent our whole day shopping and were pretty tired, so we stopped at this cute indoor plaza to chill. the place wasn’t that crowded so we got nice seats by the windows, and then my sister went to go get us coffees. a little bit after she left, this well dressed white lady who looked about 45 comes up to me holding a chair asking to sit right next to where i was sitting. i was super taken aback because like i said, the place wasn’t crowded and there were several open seats and tables. i politely told her “someone is sitting with me” and gestured to my sister’s things and all of our shopping bags, which basically took up the entire table. instead of taking the hint, she goes “i don’t mind; i’m not going to be using the table”. to avoid trouble i just said “okay”.... lol big mistake. 

like she said, she didn’t use or even face the table, she kept her purse in her lap and was facing me. we were both just silently on our phones but i was low key panicking that i did the wrong thing, lol. it just seemed so weird to me that our of all the open places to sit, she chose to come to an occupied table. i texted my sister and she was annoyed that i let the lady sit there. i didn’t want to be rude and ask the lady to leave after she was seated, so i got up and moved me and my sister’s chairs and the table with all our stuff on it. not far mind you, just a few feet so there was some distance and it didn’t seem like she was sitting with us. i wanted me and my sister to have our privacy when she got back. as i was moving the table the lady kept scoffing and rolling her eyes, which i ignored. she then muttered “what do you think you’re doing?” which i also ignored, thinking that would be the end of it. but no. after i sat down she stood up and said loudly enough for everyone to hear “why the hell did you move the table? you said i could sit there.” at this point people nearby were staring. i reminded her that she herself had said she didn’t need the table, and told her there was plenty of other seating available, to which she responded that this was a public space and she could sit wherever she wanted. i got pissed and told her no, you actually can’t just infringe on people’s personal space like that, let alone when there’s tons of empty seats. she huffed and called me a stuck up bitch.... and then she LEFT. as in she literally marched through the doors and walked out instead of finding a different place to sit. tbh this was probably the weirdest and most hostile interaction with a stranger i’ve ever had.

i do understand that it is a public space, and i feel kinda bad bc she was just sitting there on her phone. the issue is that she was sitting way too close for comfort, lol. also what she said to me was totally uncalled for. my sister thinks i am justified. so reddit, AITA for moving the table and chairs that we were using in a public place?"
1240,cpmnwa,"WIBTA If I Move Out Now? I feel kind of hated. My parents fight a lot, then take it out on me with insults or a new shouting match over nothing. One of our fights actually got so bad that my mom was trying to angrily point her finger at me to tell me off for another stupid ""sin"", but somehow managed to forget that she was holding a glass of tea in her hand, and it slipped. I covered my face, but the glass shattered on my elbow, covering my arm in cuts that required an ER visit to stitch up. She NEVER apologized. It was ""my fault"".

Fast forward a few years. I've become cold and distant, and I have three younger siblings. I don't matter unless I'm being shouted at, insulted, or, lately, if I'm needed. 

They've been demanding money from me to help pay their stuff after a few catastrophes left them with nearly no money. Because of their demands, I spent a year working at a job that treats employees badly (being stingy with breaks, not allowing days off after a friend or relative dies, threatening to fire over being a few seconds late sometimes, only giving pay raises to their friends; great place for an anxious and borderline psychotic teen to work.) 
My parents REFUSED to let me quit unless I magically found a job that could toss more money my way, and ultimately put more money into their greedy pockets. 
Because I had to work full-time, I also couldn't go to college last year, and now can't this year either (something that they SWEAR is ""all my fault"".)

Worse, I'm a free nanny to them, and haven't had a proper day off from work or their kids in ages. 
This, plus the fact that I now couldn't afford my medications thanks to them made me very unstable, prone to rage and mental breakdowns, to the point where I've actually attempted impromptu suicides, which never ended well. Somehow, they don't notice how bad I've gotten, and have either shouted at me or made jokes about these symptoms when I've mentioned them. Still, they ""expect me to always be nice to their monstrous little brats, and always respect my parents no matter what"".

I lost my job over something dumb a week ago, but we've just recently gotten to a point where my parents no longer need my money; just a free babysitter and verbal punching bag. 
But today, my dad said something that made me realize how little he cares. He told me that ""he didn't like me being mean to his babies"" (I've NEVER hurt them, but do tend to yell when I catch them PUTTING TOYS IN THE TOILET or DRAWING ALL OVER MY THINGS IN CRAYON). Dad said that ""he'll kick me out if I bully them anymore.""

Fine. I've still got my last check from work; just enough to afford the deposit on a place I've been looking at. I could leave in a week or two, and they wouldn't have to see me again.
This would leave them with no babysitter, and if they needed my money again, they'd be out of luck. 
So... would I be the a**hole for basically abandoning these people?

1241,cp7iwr,"AITA for calling my roommate out for not doing her dishes/basic cleaning and “causing her anxiety” at home Okay yeah I sound  kinda like the asshole already but let me break this down:

I moved in with 3 random girls about 2 months ago. Before anything was set in stone, I made it VERY clear that I like the shared spaces to be tidy. But like it doesn’t have to be spotless. Basically I just wanted the four of us to do our dishes/wipe up the counter if you make a mess/put your personal stuff away if it’s not going to be used for days. WE ALL AGREED ON THIS. 2 out of my 3 roommates have no problem with this. But my one roommate, we’ll call her G, can’t seem to manage any of it.

I have had very bad experiences with previous awful roommates. I didn’t want to go through that again. I just don’t want to live in a dirty place. I want to be able to walk in the kitchen without stepping on crumbs and find CLEAN dishes when I want to cook.

Last week G went on Vacation for a week and not only left a sink full of dishes but also trash, LITERAL TRASH in the sink. I’m sorry, I know I’m hot headed but it absolutely infuriated me. (This has also been a continued issue with G, amongst other things she does that are inconsiderate) 

I decided to text our roomie group message and say that it would be nice if everyone was considerate of each other and did their dishes and threw their trash away before an extended trip. Was it a little petty? Probably but AITA? I have since been pretty much ignoring her because I know I would actually be the asshole if I talked to her.

G later went to another one of my roommates and said that since the text I sent, she’s had “so much anxiety.” BUT HAS YET TO CHANGE ANYTHING. Currently a new set of food filled dishes have been in the sink for the past two days 😡

SO AITA?!

TL;DR Roommate is the fucking worst (I.e not cleaning her dishes, leaving messes everywhere she goes, generally inconsiderate) and I called her out and have pretty much ceased contact with her as much as possible. She told another roommate she’s had anxiety since I called her out but hasn’t actually shown any initiative to do better in any way. AITA?!"

S will ask to come over, and i tell him that any time is fine, and that i am free. S knows that he can’t stay late, as my roommate and I both work early in the mornings. 

there was one particular event that was the straw finally breaking the camels back for me. S suggested 6:30pm. i tell S that it is okay, that time works fine! S says that he will let me know when he’s on his way to my place. I don’t end up hearing from him until 7:20, where he proceeds to text me, “hey! on my way!”

S is constantly saying he will come over at X time and doesn’t end up contacting or showing up until at least 45 minutes to 1 hour past, sometimes even longer! i’ve brought this up to my roommate to vent and she tells me what i’m being too needy/picky about the situation. (she’s also chronically late but that’s another thing). 

So, WIBTA for asking him to be more realistic when he decides on what time he’d like to come over? There are things that i like to do after work, and when he says he’s coming over at a specific time, often i have to rush to get things done, only to have him not show up after having waited around."
1243,ea65mo,"AITA for cutting off contact with my parents My first attempt at writing a post was thwarted by the word limit, so this is heavily edited and thus loses some context.

I (32M) haven't spoken to my parents in \~3 months. My parents and I have never had a great relationship, I've always found my mother overbearing and narcissistic and my father a bit emotionally distant. When I was growing up this was fine because nobody likes their parents when they're kids/teenagers, so we really didn't have to have a relationship. Now that I'm a married father of two, the dynamic has obviously changed and I feel obligated to have my parents involved in my kid's lives, the problem is, they don't seem to want to be involved despite their constant protests otherwise.

My parents have been reborn Christians for about 5 years now, part of what I would refer to as a cult (google Jesus Life International for context on them), and are exceedingly difficult to talk to. Their conversion was not taken well by my mother's family (my dad's family is all dead or estranged), as they are culturally Jewish (non-practicing) and proud of their heritage. My wife and I are both non-practicing Jews, but accepted their new religious beliefs because, whatever, do what makes you happy.  Their new faith makes them frustrating to talk to, as the only thing they want to talk about is the problems they have with the fact that the rest of my family doesn't accept them interspersed with religiously influenced philosophizing. 

They had become frustrated with my lack of calls/texts because I find their conversation taxing and stressful, I just want to talk about the weather and their retirement and my kids, but the conversations ALWAYS get too heavy and emotionally draining. I've expressed this numerous times and they simply cannot comprehend what I'm saying, or they don't respect what I'm asking, I'm not sure which. 

The big rift arose about a year ago. My wife and I were expecting our 2nd child in February and, upon making arrangements with people to visit after the birth (my parents live in FL, we live in NY), we stated that everyone had to have their Flu shot in order to visit because it would be peak flu season. My parents decided that, for whatever reason they had, they would not get their flu shot, so I told them we wouldn't be making exceptions and that they could visit in late April/early May when flu season was over. 

My son is now almost 10 months old, and my parents have yet to visit, despite my many invitations to come. They always have an excuse about how they don't feel welcome, or money is tight (they fly to North Carolina for their church once or twice a month, in addition to their tithing), or whatever else. So in September I finally told them that, until they express a desire to see my sons (the older one is 3, whom they haven't seen since his 2nd birthday), not to contact me. They have reached out on occasion in the last 3 months but never with the intention to visit, and I've ignored them since."

1245,chrrjh,"AITA for telling a flaky friend that he is being relieved of his groomsman duties? So my wedding is about two and a half months away and I’m facing the uncomfortable prospect of asking one of my groomsmen to step down. Not uninviting him, just placing him in a reduced role. 

I am very close to this individual and have been for awhile, but he has a history of flaking and his most recent offense was particularly egregious. 

I had invited him to a concert in the city a few months back and he was psyched. He lives in an hour and a half away so the plan was for him to stay. I purchased his ticket, no biggie. A month passes and we’re about two weeks away from the concert and I haven’t heard anything from him so I assume he’s just flaking , as he tends to do, really not that big of a deal. With that in mind I invite another buddy from out of town to hang out for the weekend. 

The following week, flaky friend hits me up and is super psyched about the concert. I’m still a little skeptical at this point but whatever, we’ll see. Literally the day before the concert, flaky friend spends the morning telling me how psyched he is to go to the concert and bla bla bla so I’m like awesome, we’ll I guess I’ll just buy another ticket and get an air mattress so one can sleep on that and the other the couch. 

Sometime that evening I ask flaky buddy what his timeline looks like for the next day. Nothing. The concert was early June and I still haven’t heard a peep from him. That is the egregious part to me; I’m honestly not nearly as concerned about money spent as I am for the ghosting 24 HOURS BEFOREHAND AND THEN NOT MAKING CONTACT FOR OVER A MONTH AND A HALF.

The issue is that I’m not sure I can trust him to be where he needs to be when he needs to be there. I don’t feel comfortable putting such a huge responsibility on him when he has shown, very recently, that he simply cannot be relied upon.

1246,b83lr1,"AITA for kicking my mom off my baby's photo stream for oversharing on Facebook? I have a 6 month old baby and have always withheld her images from social media- aside from an initial announcement on Facebook looking like basically every newborn out there.
In order for my family and close friends to keep up with her, we created a shared, private photostream.

My mom is constantly posting pics of my niece and nephews on Facebook and IG. She gets the images from the photostream that my brother set up. I asked my mother to never share a picture of my daughter on her social media accounts. Aside from my desire for privacy, her FB account has been hacked multiple times and she has questionable friends- some are clearly robots.

She gave me flack for this request, saying it was not a big deal, I am being over reactive, etc. I held my ground and she relented.
I rarely check Facebook, but from time to time I like to see what old friends are up to. So I logged on and saw a comment someone made on a post belonging to someone with my mom’s name. It turns out she has an alt account, and it’s full of pictures of my baby- taken directly from our photo stream, others I have never seen that she snapped with her phone. I checked her friend list (of course it was public and not secure at all) and saw a bunch of people that I don’t know, with one or two we share as friends (how I found the account). She made this account to share pictures of my baby with people not on my photo stream.

I was livid. I called her and told her to deactivate the account. She refused. We got into a heated argument and she said the account was her property, and by me putting photos on the shared stream, I was putting them out there for her to do whatever she wants with them. I was blown away by the lack of respect. she has an addiction- sharing photos of her grandkids, and gives no damns about respect toward me or my daughters privacy.

So, I kicked her off the photostream. It’s been two weeks, and we haven’t talked since. I cannot check her alt account to see if she’s still blasting pics of my kid- she since made it private (at least there is that).
I have looked back at my moms post history and she is a text-book over sharer. At one point she posted pictures of my niece and nephew’s bare asses...I called her out on it, I got the whole lecture about being a prude, but she eventually took it down. Various things like that made me set down the rules to being with.
It’s mostly my family that is siding with my mom, and their opinions matter. They think it’s cruel I am “withholding the opportunity” for my mom to see her granddaughter grow up.
It’s worth mentioning she lives 45 minutes away and can come visit anytime, but she hasn’t since our blow out.

So, am I the asshole?

Tl;dr: I won’t share photos of my baby with my mom because she went behind my back and put them on social media.

My husband and I have been together for going on to 9 years. His son was 5 when we started dating and now we have an 8 year old and a 5 year old, also boys. 

His son is severely mentally and physically handicapped. He’s 14 now, still in diapers, and going deaf and can’t really talk. He also can’t eat regular food and can only eat through a g-tube. 

His son and I never had a connection. He avoids me and he knows who his mother is and everything is fine. I understand my place in his world and his mind. 

Recently, I’ve been pondering an idea about a tattoo for my boys and my husband asked if I was going to get my step son involved in the tattoo as well and I said I wasn’t sure. My husband got really upset and accuses me of not loving his son as much as mine.

Well. I love him differently. It’s hard to explain.

With his son’s mental issues, he doesn’t understand the physical things that are going on now that he’s hit puberty. He is having raging fits and starting to physically fight us. 

I’ve also caught him staring at my breasts, and trying to catch peeps of me when I’m in my room changing. I’ve walked in on him jacking off with my clothes all over the ground, it’s just super awkward right now and super hard to find the will to get him tattooed on my body. 

So...Am I the asshole?"
1249,dmb6x0,"AITA for 'leading my M(16) friend on: his words. Hi! I'm a new account but this event happened two weeks ago. I was in English class and talking about how my bedroom was green, until the 'friend' I was with said ""no it's blue"" and smiled? I asked him about it, and he said I shouldn't have invited him over to a 'girls' house. My parents brushed it off . I've been friends with him for two years but don't really know him that well. He sort of latched onto my friend group and I don't really like him. There have been numerous occasions where I just instinctively bristle away from him. Once, he took my notes for a question to be answered in class and answered it for another question that didn't apply, in front of everybody? It was really rude , I felt. Back to the color thing, this might be my fault due to hosting numerous hangouts at but my house but HAVE NEVER LET THEM UPSTAIRS WHICH IS WHERE ME AND MY FAMILY SLEEP. I also locked my door, but he said he got in so maybe I forgot??? I don't even know how he got in, but I asked him and he talked about the various locations as to where some of my bedroom items were kept that I'd never talked about. One would be the color of my bedsheets? I don't know whether I've been leading him on as to accepting this type of behaviour, but I don't like to argue. Two other people that were in our English group also looked very confused as to why he would say that. I don't feel comfortable around him anymore but he sits beside me in English and I don't want to rock the boat about asking the teacher whether I could sit anywhere else. I know this post sounds really weird but I really need some help quick!"
1250,bgvjy5,"AITA for telling my SIL the truth? My brother and my SIL broke up.  
They were a on and off couple since they were 15, which means I know my SIL since I was 3 years old and know her for a really long time (I'm 32) and got married when I was around 14 or 15.  
They have 3 kids together, my brother has one with another women while the marriage and another one on the way with someone else, and a house.  
Imagine my shock when my brother told me that they broke up about a year ago but hasn't told anyone because they wanted to clear things up before telling everyone and now he is demanding I stop all contact with her, because I'm part of his family not hers.  
I know her for so long and can't imagine her not being part of my family anymore. She is the mother of my niece and nephews and the aunt of my 2 kids.  
I declined, he threw a fit... basically he was a total asshole to her. Trying to throw her out of my family, talking bad about her, still having sex with her and keeping her hopes up. All this BS made me really sick but my SIL didn't wanted to give up on them.  
He told me that he already has a new girlfriend for half a year (my SIL didn't knew about and he had sex with both of them without them knowing) and want to bring her into the family.  
The moment we met her, he tells the whole family (my mother, my kids, my boyfriend etc) that she is pregnant and we aren't allowed to tell my SIL.  


The point is, my brother didn't wanted my SIL to know that because she was about to agree to split the house (1/3 her, rest his) and he knew she would try to take it away from him, if my SIL would find out about the girlfriend and the pregnancy.  
He always says that he didn't wanted to have another child, but impregnated his girlfriend 4(!!!) times (she lost 3 of them).  
Because he tormented my SIL so much over and over and refused to tell her the truth and forbid us to have contact with her I chose to step forward, meet my SIL (even tough my brother forbid it) and told her the truth.  
Now he is trying to turn the whole family against me and even threatens me to get revenge for this.  
But, AITA for telling my SIL the truth?"
1251,bg4db6,"AITA for riding my board by a mentally handicapped student? So I'm riding my boosted board (an electric longboard) back from my job this morning. For most of the way I ride in the bike lane, but about
 a quarter mile from my dorm building I have to ride on the sidewalk. This sidewalk is plenty wide enough for me to ride, plus there are no rules against riding on the side walk and it's not very busy around this time; however, there is a choke point where the sidewalk narrows and is only wide enough for like, 3 people side by side. This is where my problem happened.

As I'm approaching the choke point, I see a rather large guy walking in the middle of the sidewalk, not on the right side. Cruising at maybe 8mph, I say ""excuse me"" loud enough for him to hear so that he can get over. I know he heard me because he turned his head to look at me. He keeps walking in the middle. Fine, I'll just squeeze by him.

So I ride between the edge and the guy and just squeeze by him. Not my board, bag, or body touched him and I wasn't going very fast either, maybe the pace of a jog. Although I will say, it was a tight squeeze.

He screams ""HEY WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GOING!"" I stop ahead of him and turn around and look at him for a second before responding, ""I was watching where I was going, you're the one that didn't move when I asked. I didn't even touch you so just don't even worry about it."" To which he sort of grunted and sneered to. That was the entire conversation.

Right before I hop back on my board a girl that saw it all go down told me I was a jerk for talking like that to a mentally handicapped person. To which I replied, ""I don't care what he is, I don't like assholes."" (I didn't know he had any mental issues until she told me, but I probably wouldn't have handled it differently either way).

Am I the asshole?"

Back then she totally refused telling me that she already promised to stay at family's friend house.

1254,d98w0d,"WIBTA for cutting off fiance's mom? Lots of backstory:

For lack of a better way to say it, my fiance's parents SUCK at money management. Last year his step father had a stroke and can no longer work as a result of this. (He does get government assistance) When FIL had his stroke, the family financial problems came out. Their house was foreclosed on while FIL was in in-patient rehab. MIL never went back to work during the time FIL was in the in-patient facility. (Although she would only go visit him on weekends) As a result, she lost her high paying job at the worst possible time. 

Fast forward to now:

MIL is working again. FIL receives a significant amount of government assistance which includes food stamps, disability payments and insurance. They do not have very many expenses because they live in a motel of sorts and only pay for their phone bill. Where does their money go? Well, MIL is an AVID marijuana smoker (illegal where we live). She will buy marijuana before food and I wish I were exaggerating. When all of their money is spent MIL has no shame in calling fiance and I for money to buy anything from food all the way to marijuana. We have supported them so much, it is considered a bill in our monthly budget. WIBTA if we told MIL we will no longer support them monetarily?"
1255,c3quft,"AITA for telling a friend I am upset I feel like she mislead me? Jane and I met at work about 7 months ago and instantly became very close. I feel that support and kindness between us has been a two way street since day one. 

A few months ago I met Steve through a dating app. When I told Jane, she told me they have been friends for a few years. I didn’t ask too much about their history, she offered that they are like brother and sister and anything else is “ew gross”. She did express concern about two of her friends dating, not wanting to lose a friendship should it go bad. I assured her that wouldn’t happen on my end. 

Things went well with Steve and I at first but when it got a little rocky, I leaned on Jane for support. I don’t have a very healthy relationship history and I tend to fixate on things. So while I tried to not have this be the main topic of our conversations, it came up more often than not. 

Things ended with Steve not long ago and I am now working on moving on. This week it came up (again) in conversation with Jane. In this conversation Jane casually mentioned that Steve had had feelings for her and they had slept together. I told her I wished she had told me they dated and she said they didn’t date and she had asked me if I wanted any info about him but I declined. 

I became upset and felt as though she had mislead about their relationship. Later that evening when she was texting me, I responded to one of her messages saying that I was feeling very upset and I felt like she had mislead me. And that I am not comfortable dating someone my friend had previously been involved with. That finding this info out made me more upset about a situation I was still not over. She simply replied okay. 

However she ignored me the rest of the week at work and when I tried to talk to her through IM, she told me she didn’t want to and “I’m out”. I tired approaching her and she said “I’m busy, go away” The friendship seems to be over. 

Am I the asshole for not asking for more information up front? Did I over react when I got upset? Should I have just bit my tongue until I got over it? Or is her reaction extreme?"
1256,ene11y,"AITA for getting angry at my brother for selling me something at full price when he bought it using a discount Okay so my brother was talking to me about this huge way he could save money if he buys things in bulks. Recently he has being trying to save money on food and he found a way to do it. He decided to get protein powder so he has to spend less money on food when he does groceries. By using coupons and buying large quantities he lowered the price of one protein powder jar from 50$ plus shipping to 32 dollars with no shipping cost. I thought it was a nice deal and asked him if he could get me a jar and I would pay him. I figured this way I could also save money. He agreed. 

When the protein finally comes in, I tell my brother “great! Let me know when to pay you. How much was it?” And he says “50 bucks” I was confused because I thought he originally said each one would come out for cheaper. He said that it did come out to average 32 dollars per jar but he was charging me full price. I got upset because I asked him to get me one so I can get the cheaper price. He said that he only ordered only for himself to last him a year and that he wasn’t sure if next year he would be able to get it as cheap so he was charging me full price because otherwise he is losing money from whenever he needs to buy another jar. I told him why he didn’t just get another jar added to his order that way it didn’t affect his supply and he just said he didn’t do that so if I wanted a jar it would be 50 bucks otherwise he is not giving me one. So now my question is, do I have a right to be angry at him for charging me the full 50 bucks or am I the asshole for asking for the discount?"
1257,ch7ee6,"AITA for not being sure wheter to meet my GF parents or not? A bit of background to frame my dilemma.  


Me and my GF are an intercultural couple.  
We have been together for more than one year.  
This summer I am going to my GF's country (she is already there) to see it and maybe meet her parents.  
My flight is in a couple weeks.  
Her parents own several houses, one of which is in a village (like 500 people) and one is in the main city of the country.  


While we were planning our holiday, her parents told her that they would be in the village and it was okay to host me ( I never pushed it, I knew it is a different culture than mine and I did not want to break any social rules).  
It was clearly stated that we would sleep in different bedrooms. Again, It was fine by me.  
A couple days ago they told her that they may be in the city when I come and in that case I will not be allowed to be in the same house as them.  
Now, putting aside what they told me before, and ignoring the mental gymnastics they are using to justify this distinction, I am annoyed by the fact that they have been unsure about where they would be and they have very little regard about my situation (as far as I know neither of them have work related problems).  


Again, I am not saying they are forced to host me, I would just like to know  what is going to happen sthat I can book an hostel in advance and not at the last minute.  


I am supposed to arrive at the airport at 3 in the morning and I asked my gf if she could pick me up and at least help me get to my hostel/unknown sleep accomodation.  


Now her mother is complaining that is not necessary to come and pick me up and I can figure it out alone.  
Now, this makes me slightly unconfortable, because I barely know the local language and I will be without my phone since my carrier does not work and - as far as I know - there is no way to get a local phone number before getting to the country.  


To be clear, her mother does not care wheter my GF goes around at night, it is not that the problem.  


I understand that the culture is different, and so are the priorities, but at this point I am a bit cold about the idea of seeing them.  


AITA?"
1258,btbehz,"WIBTA if I tell my sister's ex that she cheated? So my younger sister (25) and her ex were together for about 9 years. They'd been high school sweethearts, broken up briefly to grow up a bit and got back together. I was fully expecting her ex to end up being my brother-in-law and was happy about that. He and our brother are besties, our parents like him, etc. 

Last fall my sister started a school program at a college a couple of hours away from our hometown and originally the plan, since they were already living together and had been for a couple of years, was to look for a new place halfway between hometown and school town so that each of their commutes (school for her, work for him) was reasonable. One thing and another got in the way, he was maybe less helpful that he could have been, and they ended up not finding a place so she had to get a room in a house in the school town and he stayed where they had been living.

She made new friends in her program, one of whom was a guy who also happened to be her neighbour in school town. She and her ex were having some issues - he felt neglected, she felt like he wasn't being supportive - which culminated in him accusing her of cheating and also going through her phone. To be clear, I was NOT ok with this, and was really mad at her ex for not trusting her.

Then I went home for Christmas and found out they'd broken up, but worse my sister told me that she had slept with her neighbour, twice, before she and the ex were officially oven. Even worse, before the searching her phone fiasco, they had actually drunkenly kissed. So at this point, while I still think going through her phone was a no-no, I'm starting to understand why he was concerned.

So they are broken up but still close friends and hang out all the time. I am the only one in our family who knows she cheated, my brother and the ex are still besties. The thing I'm concerned about is that it looks like they will end up getting back together and while I love the ex and would still be happy to have him as my brother-in-law, I don't think it's fair for her to start up with him again without being honest. Her reasoning is that they were ""in the process of breaking up"" and for her ""it was already over"" when she slept with the other guy, but I don't like the idea of lying to someone I respect for the rest of our lives...

So, WIBTA if I tell my sister either she comes clean, or I will tell him?"

Recently, my sister passed away and my family has taken it incredibly hard. My mom has cried every day since it happened and she told me to please listen to her and give her a chance to what she has to say. That was the moment I started doubting my decision.

She has an abusive history with us; she used to throw things at me, pull my hair, throw me outside whenever I misbehaved, stuff like that. It evolved to emotional abuse like calling me a whore for having friends drive me home, telling me I’ll never graduate high school, that kind of thing.

Instead of answer the question I asked or continuing the conversation, the whole conversation will literally pause and focus on me not checking the family group chat enough.

We share photos and leave VMs too"" to which I reply ""well that doesn't change the fact you mostly converse in Chinese.""

The other day for Christmas, I got a couple LEGO sets. I know, I'm an adult and I still live at home, but LEGOs can still be pretty cool. Now, my family tends to have pretty big Christmases, and usually for a few weeks after Christmas, we put all our new stuff back under the tree for easy access. Right there, in the living room, I had my two, new, unopened LEGO sets.

I was on the couch playing video games, when my brother and his friends came in. We're similar in age, so most of our friends are mutual, but he definitely hangs out with them more. They're trying to find something to do to kick the night off. While they're all over, just chillin, ""Bert"" walks over, and and opens one of my LEGO sets. This is where I might be in the wrong. Bert continues to build the set at the foot of the couch. The way I was sitting, I couldn't see him. I was also focused in video games, and not whatever was going on with my brother and his friends.

Eventually, ""Ernie"" gets up, and starts building the seat with Burt. This is when I notice what they're doing. I stood up, pulled my headphones off, and as calmly as possible said ""What the heck guys? Is that my LEGO set?"" They sheepishly nodded. I then started to scold them, saying like ""dude, thats \*my\* set, what made you think you could build it? why would you open my stuff?"" I then told them all to get out, and find something else to do, though I never raised my voice. The other friends were already getting bored, so now they're all off getting soda. I told my brother about it, and he said that I could just break it and build it again, and that I should've noticed what they were doing (it was right in front of me after all). He also said that there was no reason to embarrass them, and myself like that. I've got to admit, I kind of agree. so, AITA?

I worked in public education. I'm not contract like teachers. I can leave or be fired anytime throughout the year. I have worked at this position for 3 years. I have worked with the current supervisor for the entirety of my time. It's been great working with the staff. I chose to leave because I want make more money and I dont want to teach. When I took the job I thought I wanted to but kids are awful. When I told my direct supervisor i would be leaving they were not thrilled about it but I expected that reaction.(it would be telling of me if people were excited for me to leave) Over the next few days supervisor started playing the silent game. Only speaking to me when absolutely necessary. 

I feel like that's petty and immature. 


The other part that seems very hypocritical about this entire situation is that at the end of a previous year my supervisor moved to a different school. They told me about it right after the principal found out, 1 week before the school year ended. I was completely blindsided. Nothing had been said about finding a new job. But I was gracious and said I was happy they would be going to a better situation. My supervisor ended up getting me transferred to their school which was closer to home for me. I don't feel like that means I should be indebted to this job for life, especially when I make so little. 


Some of the other people I have told that I'm leaving have been happy for me since I'll be making more money. The school principal was sad I'm leaving and he said finding my replacement will be difficult because im so flexible with duties but agreed I dont get paid enough for what I have to put up with. my pay is not decided by him. 

On my last official day someone spilled my news to most of the staff and people started trickling by to either yell at me or wish me well. I cant wrap my head around being pissed at someone for moving on to a better higher paying job.

This guy is somewhat of a killjoy and ever since he took psychedelics, he has become this really spiritual and religious person (something we all are not). This has led us to not inviting him to other parties because in the past, it just hasn't been fun with him around.

But my friend never responded to his DM, or read it, so he hits another one. ""Why have you forsaken me"".

At this point he's just inviting himself. Are we the assholes if we don't invite him?

TL;DR: we don't wanna invite this guy (who isn't very close to us) to our party because he's a killjoy, another friend told him about the party, and now he's basically inviting himself."
1270,d7m3uc,"AITA for getting angry about something my brother said to my sister? This is going to be a bit of a rollercoaster.

Basically, I was at the dog park and called my dog over (she weighs about 125 lbs, large breed' I'm a 5'0 female, weigh about 110 lbs). She ran to me at full speed a knocked me down *hard*. Not her fault at all, she didn't mean to knock me down. But I definitely got a concussion from it. There were four people who saw and helped me and my mom had to come grab me because I was really messed up. A nice lady walked me to my mom and explained what she saw as well.

Anyways, I am extremely nauseous and crap, I've had at least 5 concussions in my life (I'm 18). I can barely be in a room with a lot of lights and shit and it's my night to do dishes. I tell my brother (16) that I will get him McDonald's tomorrow if he does them for me because I just want to go up to my room for the night. He agrees.

Basically, he told my sister he thought I was lying and started get upset with her for not doing dishes. Me and him have a poor relationship, I only asked him because my sister said no. She told me what he said, I got upset with him, he said that there is no way in hell I got a concussion from that (while Im sitting in my room in complete darkness) because ""he played football and knows how that works"" and he went and talked to my parents. 

My parents got mad at me and my sister for gossiping and said that she shouldn't have told me that, and that I'm just using it as an excuse to be mad at him. It's my opinion that he should also be in trouble for gossiping as well since he talked to my sister behind my back.

TL;DR: I got a concussion, asked my brother to take care of stuff for me and promised him I'd get him food in return, he talked shit about me ronny sister and she told me about it, my mom is now mad at me for being angry about it. 

AITA for getting upset with him? Should I have just stayed out of it? Not looking for validation here, I have run into similar issues with my brother and I want to know if I am the asshole.

Edit: Not sure if my brother got in trouble or not. My mom made him do the dishes and I'm still buying him food and stuff. It's possible he could have gotten in trouble as well."
1271,eswbsc,"AITA For Getting Upset That My Husband Partially Exposed Me To A Stranger? This is more of a 'Did I over-react' that an 'Am I TA', but I'm not sure there's a sub for that, so..

For some context, our bedroom window faces directly out onto the communal yard of our flatblock, with the back door to the building being right next to our window at a right-angle.

We were both chilling in our room, I was laying on the bed in a t-shirt and knickers, when we heard a knock at our window. Our blind was closed, but we assumed it was someone trying to get into the building so we ignored it, but they knocked a couple more times until my husband suddenly, to my shock and embarresmet, lifted the blind up to talk to whoever it was.

As we'd expected it was some man we didn't know asking for us to let him in.

I Was shocked and embarrassed, because as I said, was lying there with no pants on, and now there's some strange guys face peering in through the window, only about 4 metres tops away from me.

As my husband lifted the blind I tried to tell him not to, and was able to quickly pull the duvet over myself. I Hope I did it in time that the man didn't see anything, but even with the duvet covering me I still felt kinda vulnerable and embarrassed to have a stranger staring in at me in my bedroom like this. It's a pretty small room with a proportionately large window, (The window takes up just over half th wall space) so I felt a bit like a goldfish on display.

My husband had a short exchange with the guy of about 20-30 seconds, throughout which I was whispering through clenched teeth for him to close the blind. When he was finally done and the man had gone I started asking, 'Why did you do that?' At which point he suddenly burst into anger at me, and started ranting in an almost yell, asking why I have to always over-react/
Throw a fuss about things that don't matter (I Can't recall his exact wording)

At this point I felt a bit guilty and started questioning myself. I Am a very private, easily embarrassed, and somewhat prudish person. I Wonder if maybe this wssn't something I should've felt embarrassed or gotton annoyed about.

Now I look back, I wonder if it's really as bad as a thought in the moment. For one, I was able to lift the duvet over myself in time so I was covered, plus I was positioned behind my husband in a way that the man may not have even had a clear view of me, and also my husband was aswell himself just in a t-shirt and boxers, so was in the same postion as I was and if anything was exposing himself  even more than he was me.

So, was a just being silly and wrong to complain?"
1272,b9g2ky,"AITA for being pissed off at my dad and little brother? I (M23) live at home at the moment after returning from university. I pay rent every month which goes to helping out with food and bills etc. My little brother (M21) also lives at home and does the same.

After returning from university I noticed that my dad and brother are the laziest people I know when it comes to general house tidiness. They leave shoes and amazon packaging everywhere, pubes on the bathroom floor and sink for over a week (I know it's one of them because of the hair colour), dishes beside the dishwasher, never put the bin out, piss on the toilet seat and never tidy up any spilled food.

In contrast, maybe somewhat unbelievably, I lived for 4 years at university with various flatmates and our uni flats were by far tidier than at home. Everyone cleaned up after themselves and done their own dishes etc. I'm embarrassed when my girlfriend comes over too because her house is always so tidy and her and her parents are just tidy people.

I've noticed that it is just me and my mum who always seem to be the only ones doing any household chores. My mum, at one point told us all when I was 16 that she needed more help around the house and I feel I'm the only one trying.

I've tried before to tell them to put stuff away and tidy up after themselves but I get ""It's my house! I can leave things wherever I want"" and constantly get shouted down. I'm at the point where I'm getting more and more stressed to the point I'm going to explode soon.

I'm moving out soon and I worry for my mum that when I do she's going to return from work every day and be burdened with all of this more than I know she already is but at the same time she also needs to speak up and make her voice heard.

1275,c1gwiv,"AITA for not giving the brother of my Elementary and Middle School Bully a chance? (repost) \*Note BB stands for ""bully's brother,"" original was super long, so I'm resubmitting it lol\*

&#x200B;

I don't know how to add all the details within a 3,000-word limit so sorry if this seems messy. To make a long story short, I had a girl that used to torment me from Elementary up until the summer before our 10th-grade year, when she finally became uninterested in me and left me alone. The bullying was super bad, and I considered ending my life at one point, so the scars are deep even to this day. I had a super close relationship with BB that started in 9th grade when we were sat next to each other in a class. That all came to a head when one day he asked if I would be his girlfriend, but told me not to tell anyone. His reasoning? (and these were his exact words) ""you have a really pretty face, like the prettiest I've ever seen but you're kinda fat, and I don't want anyone to know I like a fat girl."" Those are not the words an already super insecure 9th-grade girl needed to hear, and so we stopped talking, all without an apology from him to this day. The problem began when he came into my job this summer, and asked me out on a date (he came in for an unrelated reason). I had been pretending not to know who he was to save myself from having to converse with him, but I guess he recognized me anyway. I was livid, even after asking him if he remembered what he said to me in 9th grade and getting a ""yes"" back, he still refused to apologize. Now the real problem lies with my friends; when I told them what happened, there was an immediate divide. My university friends thought I was being a bitch for rejecting him for something he said as a kid (even after telling them he refused to apologize). While my old friends who were there during the bullying days told me, I did nothing wrong, and he doesn't deserve a chance, especially since he won't apologize. I only have three old friends, so the opinions of my university friends got to me, and I agreed to go on a date with him. It wasn't too bad, it was easy to see why we had become such close friends in the first place, but I couldn't get his sister or 9th grade out of my mind, so I made up and excuse and left. You can probably guess what my friends had to say about this, it's been about two weeks and some of them are still upset about the situation. The divide in opinions is making this all very confusing. AITA for not giving him a chance for something he said as an immature 9th-grade boy, especially when part of it is tied to who his sister is?"
1276,e6ihfp,"AITA for cutting my sister out of my life for being shitty to my son At the beginning of summer I F/27 and my kids let’s call them Sam M/6 and Sally F/2 traveled across the country to visit my sister. While we were there Sam didn’t act in a way that my sister thought was suitable calling him embarrassing (with him in the room hearing all this) and generally undisciplined and not well behaved. I was stunned by this from her but what really broke my heart is when Sam would try to connect with her about his interest, which would usually be a tv show or video game she look right at him and say “I don’t care,” loudly and deliberately. He would get upset about it and tell her how it makes him feel but she wouldn’t hear it. She is against tv and video games so I passed the rude behavior off as her tough love. I spoke to her about it but it kept happening. After a couple of days of this I, falling to pieces because this relationship meant so much to me, moved my flight and left in the morning. I felt I needed to protect him. 

I was proud of myself for standing up to my big sister. I love her so much and I’m alway afraid of doing or saying something that will make her want to distance herself from me. But the way she was treating him wasn’t an OK thing for her to do.

Honestly she may have been right. Sam may have been acting a little crazy as his parent I am too close to the situation to see it from other people’s point of you I just see him acting normally.

Now I’ve had 6 months to cool off and the snapchats we used to share everyday aren’t there and I don’t get to know how my 2 y/o nephew is doing and most of all Sam keeps bringing her up saying that he wants to see her and that he misses her and how are we going to get to see her this Christmas always saying these things unprompted.

 I'm currently sitting near the dirty clothes and it smells like wet dog. He feels I am asking for too much. Am I ? I just thought if it was my birthday, he could try and make me feel a little more comfortable in his room. 

I also did ask him if he could just take a minute to wipe off the mold by his bed on the window sill. Just with a clorox wipe because its about the size of maybe 3 quarters ,and i thought he could just wipe it a little bit so I'm not breathing it in. It's right by where we would be sleeping.

1278,el30cp,"AITA for interrupting my SO's phonecall to call them out in a lie Okay, so I regretted doing it as soon as I did it, but I don't know how to navigate this situation and apologize without making it seem like what they did was okay.

My SO and I were recently involved in a multiple car pile up. Someone came to a complete stop on a busy highway without warning and caused a string of rear ends. My SO's car was the third to make contact, and mine was the 4th. Their vehicle is fine (suburbitank), mine was totaled (mini cooper) on their trailer hitch and I ended up with some injuries. The first two vehicles were trucks, both fine and the drivers were uninjured. 

An insurance agent called my SO today, apparently the guy at the front of the line was claiming a back injury on all if our insurances. I happened to be in the room, and I didn't know what the call was about nor was I paying attention. Then I heard my SO say my full name in a formal sounding voice, so I started paying attention. My SO proceeded to claim that I drove into them at full speed without breaking and pushed them into the next vehicle, which isn't what happened. I'm not saying I was faultless in the accident, but I wasn't that negligent. I started to tell my SO that what they were saying wasn't true, and my SO waived me off then said to the person on the other side of the phone ""sorry (they) doesn't like that I'm talking to you"".

At that point I was p*ssed, so I put my face up to their mic and said ""no, I'm not mad that (they're) talking to you I'm mad that (they're) lying."" Then I stormed off. I know I should've settled the problem in a more adult way, and my actions didn't help anyone. My SO was angry. I apologized for interrupting, but im still really mad that they threw me under the bus. 

I know that I have a tendency to overreact at times and I need some outside opinions.

So AITA for interrupting my SO lying about me during an insurance investigation? And AITA for still being mad about it?"
1279,7yt5ci,"AITA in This Argument With My Parents? So I posted here a little while ago about an argument I had with my parents that eventually led to me being kicked out of the house for a few hours. Well, it's happened again.

So I was doing some math homework in the kitchen and having trouble with it. I've never been great at math but I need it if I want to do economics, which is what I'm currently going for my degree in. After I had so much frustration with the homework I decided to sit down with my parents and have a talk about the possibility of changing my major from economics to history, something that I've always been good at. 

My parents were really opposed to this change and tried to tell me that I could do the math with a little more effort and that when I got out of school I wouldn't need to use a lot of the math anymore. I disagreed with their second point, saying that economists use a lot of math and that I'd have to know how to do advanced math and probably use it frequently. I also said that I wanted to change majors because I didn't think I wanted to do economics the rest of my life, even if I technically could do it. This went back and forth for a little while and the argument got more and more heated over time. Eventually, it got to the point where my mom was cutting my off in the middle of my sentences, mocking me, telling me that I had quit everything I had ever done in life, and eventually began yelling at me. 

When I pointed out to her that this type of behavior was wrong and that she would not tolerate it from me and called her a hypocrite because of it, she told me to ""go to hell"" and to go to my room and grounded me from a few of my things.

I went to my room and was enraged that I got in trouble for simply pointing out that my mom was being way out of line. This is when I realized that when we had had our first argument a few weeks ago where my parents kicked me out my mom had taken away a pistol that I had in my room (that had been given to me by my grandfather) without explaining why. I had been thinking of asking for the pistol back for a while and I figured that since I was already in trouble, I couldn't lose much by going and trying to get what I considered my property back. 

I went to ask for the gun and my parents refused to give it back, this went back and forth for a while and then my dad came in and forced me into my room. We had a discussion for a little while and I told him about my problems with the way my mom and how it was wrong for her to speak to me that way. He told me that he didn't think that she had done anything wrong and that they didn't want to give me the gun back because they thought I may harm someone or myself with it. Something I want to make clear is that I had no intention of doing any of that and have never so much as slapped any of my family members, nonetheless try to shoot them. The idea itself is absolutely appalling to me. 

At this point, my mom walked into my room and the argument started again. It got to the point where my mom got extremely angry and began to throw things across my room, knock things off my walls, and get into my face like she was about to hit me. 

After this, she told me to leave the house and I told her that I would happily leave if I could take everything that was mine with me. My mom refused this and told me that she was going to get a bat. My sister stopped her from taking the bat into my room, but my mom still demanded that I leave the house, which I did. I went out on the porch and called my grandparents to come pick me up.

In the meantime, my mom made my sister go and get the bat, which she had thrown into the yard to prevent anyone from using it. While my sister brought the bat back inside, my mother told me that if my sister hadn't stopped her that she would have hit me upside the head with the bat.

After a while, my grandpa showed up to pick me up, and I informed my parents that I was leaving. They didn't like the idea that I was leaving, even though they had told me to leave earlier. I got a few of my things and went to my grandparents. 

There's a little more to this story that transpired today. I went back home to collect some stuff I needed for school and in the meantime I apologized to my parents for some of the things I had said and done (I had used some strong language and points and told my mom to go to hell after she had told me to do the same). I was hoping that they would apologize for their actions too, and that we could get over it and move on. My parents never apologized though, and proceeded to tell me how I was responsible for everything that happened. My mom denied that she had mocked me and even denied that she had told me that she would have hit me in the head with the bat. The argument only got more heated until I decided to leave and go back to my grandparents. My mom told me that if I went back to my grandparents, that I couldn't come back to house again and basically that she wanted nothing to do with me anymore. Given the situation, I decided to leave in the hope that everyone would calm down in a few days, but I'm really concerned that my family may have been damaged very badly. 

So, was I in the wrong here? Also, if you'd like to help me out, what do you think I should do from here on out to repair the situation."

Yesterday I snapped in the middle of her rant about how all men are the same and said to her that she isn't a great catch and should either take care of herself more and better herself or lower her standards because everyone around her is tired of her bitching, she stayed quiet and we didn't talk since.

1281,badt22,"AITA for ghosting someone who thought we were best friends? There is this guy who I met freshman year who seemed rude but had no friends so I felt bad for him. We never talked but then summer came around and he asks to video chat which we did a couple times. When summer came to an end we got brunch and he started crying in the middle of the meal talking about how he has no friends and how his roommates we assholes for not being his friends (even though they were random roommates). I tried my best to console him and give him a shoulder to cry on.

We didn’t talk for a while when he asked if I wanted to get food and a movie. This is where I began to get super uncomfortable.

He always seemed to get into some really serious topics and would say things like “if my kid was gay I would feel like a failure as a parent” and “I don't understand why girls are always afraid of men. I think it's just an excuse for them to be rude.” I tried my best to explain in a calm manner but I was honestly really upset during the whole dinner.

Somehow we got to the topic of dating and he said we might as well start dating cuz that’s what we were doing without the sex? which was kind of insane to me given this is the second time we were hanging out in like 4 months?  I kept telling him I wasn’t looking to date anyone right now but he kept insisting. He just wasn’t taking no for an answer and I was getting really uncomfortable. I was ready to end things until after the movie when he said that I was his best friend at the school which seemed so sad to me that I ignored my gut.

He asked me to go to a football game with him a while later. I spent the first couple minutes with him, then left to see someone. Coming back after the first quarter, I see him harassing a woman who was sitting next to her boyfriend. All I hear is her yelling “please just leave us alone” with a terrified look on her face. I asked him what was going on he explained that these fake fans were sitting when they should be standing for the team. He seemed to be totally proud of himself for yelling and invading this persons space after her repeatedly telling him to stop.

This is where I totally flipped the switch and listened to my gut and told him my friend needed me and goodbye. I didn't answer his texts and unfollowed/blocked him.

Near the end of the semester, he texts saying that he understands that he may have made me uncomfortable with the dating thing and that he’s sorry regardless if I respond. I thought this was mature but did not respond due to dealing with my own mental health issues that landed me in the hospital a few days later.

Yesterday he sent me a text that just says “You’re a fucking cunt.”

Am I the asshole for ghosting him? I feel really guilty but the whole “not having any empathy for anybody” and “not respecting boundaries at all” really scared the shit out of me. I don’t know where the “I’m protecting myself and having boundaries” and “Try to be as empathetic as possible” line is here.

The very first weekend Z had \~10 people over nearly all 48 hours. He told me that he was just really excited to have people over to see the place. The following Friday night, \~6 people come over, hang out all night and sleep over. That Saturday, 6 more people come over, sleep over.

At this point I polite-fully asked if he could try to limit the amount of people/people sleeping over. The following day, he has 6 people over (weeknight where myself and the other roommate had work the next morning) until midnight where I had to ask him to have everyone leave. After this time I told him no more sleep overs and to really try to limit people coming over.

The following weekend was good, however, weekend after that I come home and there are 4 people sleeping over again. I talk to him the next morning and he tells me that they got locked out of the place they were staying and needed somewhere to crash. I went on a business trip last week and the other roommate told me that people were over Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and then Saturday with multiple people sleeping over. I came home from my week long business trip Sunday night and get a text that people were coming over at 8:30 PM which they then stayed until 11:45 when I asked him to have everyone leave so i can go to sleep for work.

Finally, this past weekend I got a 3rd noise complaint in the last 1-2 months from my neighbors who are now threatening to start calling the police because my roommate had 5+ people over. 

There is no formal written lease in place and I told him today that there is now a rule of a maximum 2 guests at the same time allowed over. AITA for setting this rule?"
1287,dsp30c,"AITA for calling my boss out on sexual comments? I (20/f) got hired to a small town diner as a waitress about three months back and had always liked my boss (<50/m, let's call him B). He was laid back and funny and easy to talk to. I also loved his wife, who worked as a waitress with me. The only thing that irked me was tiny comments B had make that were a tad sexual (i.e. commenting about hickeys I had on my neck, telling me that I need to post on the diner's FB page even when I'm ""getting laid"", etc.) I loved the job so I decided to ignore them.

One day, I was scheduled to open the store and so I walked over at 9am and began setting up the store. Around 9:30 I get a call from B saying that I need to pack everything back up because the waitress won't be coming in. I pack everything up and begin walking home. I'm almost at the door when B calls me again, so I pick up, and he tells me to come back because the waitress had finally replied to him saying she's coming in. I was kinda pissed that I had to go back so decided to ask to borrow my boyfriend's car so I wouldn't have to walk again.

So, I texted B, saying ""Trying to get my boyfriend to let me borrow his car.

B replied a few seconds later with ""Good thinking I wonder what a young girl could do to help perswade a young man to do such a thing. Google Bop It, you might get some ideas.""

I was stumped on how to reply, so I called my dad and best friend, and wound up telling him that it's disrespectful to make sexual comments toward me. He replied backpeddling and then trying to pity me into coming in. I eventually gave up and wound up staying home, and later that day I got fired.

Am I the asshole?

TL/DR: My boss joked about me performing sexual favors for my boyfriend to borrow my car so I could go to work. AITA for not going in? Did I deserve to be fired?"
1288,e8t6ex,"AITA for not telling my family how much I earn? I recently got my first job (I'm 19) and received my first salary. I generally try to be somewhat private about myself because I have trust issues with my mom due to how easily angered she is over small things or how panicky she is whenever I am not home a bit later than she expected (a bit of a helicopter parent, to say the least), and when asked about how much I got paid I just said it's not important, which led to us arguing but me maintaining that I have a right to privacy and that it's my own personal information, and her arguing that because I earn above minimum wage, meaning she won't get alimony fees (note: where I live the minimum wage is NOT a livable wage), and that I am not telling how much I earn she can simply not make/get food for me or care for me at all, as well as threatening me with asking my country's IRS about how much I earn with the official reasoning of understanding why she should not get alimony (although I am willing to doubt they would provide such information). In a nutshell, she threatened to cut me off.

I just do not want her to take advantage of knowing the amount of money I have (which is still rather little), and believe that it is normal for a person not to tell how much they earn. And I don't tell anyone in the family how much I earn either, due to the fact that I believe it's private.

Am I the asshole here?"

And I'm not doing so because they happen to be hyperactive kids with no rules or discipline and their mom has a habit of leaving them under other people's supervision at family gatherings.

I told my parents I wasn't inviting them and they asked ""are other kids getting invited?"" And unfortunately, the answer is yes. There will be two other kids there close to the age of my god-kids, but I know I won't have to worry about them. (That answer btw went over like a lead balloon)

Except... the boss man has temperament issues. So the first day I worked with him he started slamming doors yelling and throwing things, and I admit, it was a bit scary. Today he did the same but twice as bad, twice as loud, and for a longer amount of time but directed at me, throwing personal insults at me and yelling at me, even though I didn’t specifically do anything wrong as far as I know, as it was about half way through my third day each day being 3-4 hours each. I feel bad because I left during a rush (which is when he started throwing his fit) and I also said “if you don’t f**king want me here I can go” which I admit was a bit rude, but not uncalled for then he told me to leave and I did. And I also feel bad about only giving it about 9ish active hours total before I quit and I know his business is suffering and I probably made it worse because he doesn’t have anybody to do the job I was doing (the girl I replaced moved away) and I just want to know am I the asshole for quitting so soon and leaving him in a bad position.

1291,arljs4,"AITA for cutting my family out of all family celebrations? Namely birthdays, but some other stuff as well.

Long story short, I was born on NYE and New Year is a fairly big thing in my family. As far as I can remember the only things I'd get for my birthday were a cake and a present with the line ""this is for St. Nicholas' Day, Christmas and your birthday."" Sometime during middle school I stopped giving a damn about the NYE and NY, and I'd spend most of the time either helping out in the kitchen or playing Diablo 2 (that became some sort of tradition for me).

Note: I'm in mid-20s, living in a family house. Not unusual in my area.

Fast forward to some years back. There used to be a bistro nearby which was going to close with Jan 1st. I found out around mid-November. They had this one weekly special which I always wanted to try - there's a large bit of prep time and the taste is never ""right"" if you make it at home. I pitched the idea to celebrate my birthday there to my mom, who thought it was a great idea and we pitched the idea to grandparents. Problem was the last good opportunity to do so was the next day. Anyway, Grandpa was silent, and the Grandma's response was ""We went somewhere yesterday so we don't feel like going anywhere tomorrow. I cooked food for two days. And it's not a good time to waste money. And next week [duties] start, so we won't have the time."" Later, mom told me grandma was right, that just the two of us will celebrate it at a similar bistro at some future point in time and it was left at that.

That year, between Christmas and New Year, I simply disappeared right before lunch. No notice or anything. It's something I just don't do. I went to a Chinese restaurant. The context is I've been trying to go with _anyone_ for years, but never did. My friends are either on the other side of the country or spread around the globe, so that leaves my mom who always stalled (for various reasons, some of them financial) until I gave up.

Next year I had a minor thing to celebrate, family tradition. From the start it was stressed as _my_ celebration. I got home one day from work, done surprisingly early, only to be greeted with ""I'm glad you're here! We're celebrating your thing on Sunday with Y, but no one feels like dressing and going there, so we want you to go there, pick up the food to-go and bring it here."" This was a month after we talked and I explained what and where I wanted to do/have. From everything I heard, I had no reason to think that conversation wasn't forgotten, so I went with my original plan.

That year's birthday party is what I count as the only birthday celebration I had with my family in the past ~8 years, rather than being present at a party celebrating my birthday (which was always pushed aside for sparkling wine and fireworks). I had to effectively emotionally blackmail everyone involved to get to celebrate how I wanted. No one complained about the food, ambience or anything, only had constructive criticism about some stuff.

And then comes the last year, where my mom asked me what I wanted to have for my birthday. I told her X, Y or Z. Her response was ""Those are okay ideas, but I don't like them for this occasion, so I'll make H and D."" I nodded, helped her search for the recipe she wanted and went to celebrate on my own two weeks later.

Each time except the first, there was a massive argument with my mom. I explained where I went and why I went there. Primary emotion driving me was always anger. In her case, she was always viscerally hurt by me excluding her from my birthday. Pointing out I always felt excluded from _my_ birthday... didn't help.

After the last time, she basically swore off ever doing anything for my birthday again - until I deem her worthy of celebrating with me. 

So... am I the asshole? And writing this did feel a bit therapeutic."
1292,dqe31x,"AITA for not telling my teacher he forgot about me during a test because he made me mad? To start, I hate one of my teachers. Hes super rude and sarcastic, and loves to embarrass people with weird punishments. 

  So, normally my high school eats lunch outside, but it was pouring freezing rain so we split into 3 classrooms to eat inside. I had class in the same room, so I just stayed there. At the beginning of class, he told us to scatter our desks for a test. I moved mine, then saw two people get computers so I figured he'd said to. I got my laptop, and then he said the desks were scattered terribly and for us to fix them. He then said he didn't say we could get our laptops yet ( even though I don't see why it matters because they were closed, but whatever. ) I didn't put mine up right away because I was fixing some other people's desks, then got some food on my hand from a desk and had to go get hand sanitizer. When I got back, he called me out while everyone was pretty quiet and told me I should have put my laptop up. He literally said ""I have some poetic Justice for you."" He asked me what number my laptop was, and I'm the last number in the class ( 20 ). He then said ""Okay, 1-19 get your laptops."" I sat at my desk, still kinda embarrassed and started doodling on my paper. Then, everyone started their tests. So I waited..and waited.. and he never told me to get my laptop. I didnt have any way to tell the time without the laptop, so I just kept doodling..then people started finishing their tests and I knew he'd forgotten about me. I didn't raise my hand or say anything because I figured his ""poetic justice"" was making me stay after school or something. I'll admit I also was pretty pissed at him. When there were 5 minutes left in class, he came to my desk and asked me if I was done. I said no, and he realized what happened. He said ""I am so sorry"" and waited for me to say it was okay, which I didn't. I was really mad he'd embarrassed me then forgotten me but I didn't say anything. He finally let me get my laptop. The tests we take are 4 super easy questions so I finished right before the bell rang in 4-5 minutes. I'm still really mad at him. He's been reported a bunch of times for being rude and unprofessional with his students ( refusing to call them their preferred pronouns, getting mad if they doodled then refusing to teach them the lesson, giving them the silent treatment if they talk in class. Another recent incident was him telling us we can't write notes while he put them on the board, which I find a huge waste of time, and when someone tried to write notes, he angrily snatched his pencil and threw it across the room, breaking it )

Tl;Dr teacher gets mad I didn't put my laptop up, doesn't let me get it for a test, forgets about me while everyone tests, I don't tell him he forgot and I don't forgive him like he seems to expect.."

Sometimes I have to at 6am in the morning or 9-10 pm after hours. All fine. Had to travel to a client visits which required traveling out on a friday and coming back on a thursday or flying out on a thursday and coming back late on Saturday, flying out Sunday evening coming back during the week. 

Now with Christmas coming up I asked for time off and HR told me I didn't have that many days left and I argued that 3 of those we in exchange for three days from weekends I worked with no pay. minutes later I get called into a meeting with HR, a senior manager I don't report to and the boss. The boss challenged me for asking for these three days as something ""unheard of"", citing that every company he worked for it was the norm that traveling included extra hours. As an important member of the team this would be expected of me. I argued that after hours or extra hours were one thing but working saturdays and sundays is entirely different. He said he needed time to think about this and later sent me a message to say that I can have the three days back. 

Now he barely greets me in the morning and avoids small talk. 

I enjoyed going to work but now I feel like shit when I come here. 

Colleagues had been in the same situation but instead of speaking up they complain behind his back.

1294,d61ak3,"AITA for not wanting to go hangout with my father? Okay the title may sound harsh but hear me out. I’m a 17yo male, and i’ve always had problems with my parents. All of my siblings are females so my father has always been pressuring me into becoming a “man”. I’m not supposed to cry, i’m not supposed to hangout with my friends or talk to them in a joking way, i’m not supposed to have a meme photo as my profile picture on whatsapp or other apps, and i’m supposed to always be serious. My father has an office-like apartment where he sorts his papers there after work or continue his work with coworkers (he works in court). He used to force me to go there since i was a child when he knew i never wanted to go. He used to force me to sit and listen to them talk to gain “life experience” from there when i can’t use my phone as it was deemed “inappropriate”. There is literally nothing for me to do there and everyone else 40-50yo. Also fyi I’d go there at 4:00 pm return home at 11:00 pm or midnight because thats when he returns home.

As soon as i started college, I used college as an excuse not to go there. He scolded me for not going, saying that I’m supposed to be with him when other coworkers would bring their children with them. My mother supports him and tries to force me to go too. My dad has taken my phone from me multiple times because of me not going. I tried to tell him i don’t enjoy it there, but he just tells me to shut up.

My sisters and mother call me an asshole for refusing to go and that i don’t understand how my father feels and he just wants to “bond with me”, trying to make me feel guitly.

So, am I the asshole for not wanting to go to that place and stay with my father?

TL;DR: My father forces me to go to his office-like apartment to spend the day with him when i don’t enjoy it or have anything to do there forcing me to listen to him talk with co-workers and taking my phone away for refusing to go sometimes. Mother and sisters call me an asshole for not going."

When I said I couldn’t afford to help them. I told her I can just afford our rent, and I would need to get another part time job to help pay their stuff and instead of getting another job to finish school I will need to use it on them. She got mad at me after I said that and said I was being ungrateful and she no longer wanted to talk to me.

1296,cogxw6,"AITA for being angry at an Avon lady? So I live in area that has a high volume of cold callers/canvassers knocking on doors and junk mail being posted. I find this very rude and annoying and plus my dog starts barking like crazy every time this happens, so I bought a sign to put on my letterbox (right next to the door knocker) that clearly says 'NO COLD CALLERS OR JUNK MAIL'.....so I was relaxing at home last Saturday when I heard the letterbox bang (my dog started going crazy again), so I went to investigate and noticed it was a leaflet that said 'Avon will be posting a catalogue at this address next week', so I opened the door and saw a woman with a satchel full of said leaflets, so I said ""Why did you just post that? Can't you read?"" whilst pointing to the sign. So she said in a rather smug and smarmy tone ""I didn't see the sign, and they don't apply to Avon anyway, we can post wherever we want thanks"", so I said ""Clearly I don't want anything from Avon if I've gone to the trouble of putting this sign there"" so I then handed her the leaflet back and said ""Do not post anymore junk mail here in future as you have set my dog off"", so she snatched the leaflet and said ""Whatever"" as she sulked off.

So fast forward a week later to today, and I'm sat here relaxing again, and again there's a bang at the letter box, and again my dog starts barking like crazy. So I go to the door and unbelievably there's a damn Avon catalogue laying on the floor, so I opened the door and it's the same damn women again, so I said ""What the hell are you doing?? I told you last week about this!!"" And she said ""And I told you that Avon can post wherever we want, signs don't apply to us thank you very much"", so at this point I threw the catalogue into a bunch of mud next to her and said ""Take your crap and don't ever come back here again ok?"" so she said ""What's your problem? I'm just trying to make a living like everyone else.....and if that catalogue is damaged, you'll be paying for it!!"" before picking the catalogue up and storming off.

1297,akx2df,"AITA For kicking a friend out of my house when she needed a place to stay. To start of this story I had just gotten out of the ER after staying in it for 2 days for mental health issues. It was also the day before the new school year started. My best friend at the time (Ryan) called me when I got home and asked if his girlfriend (let’s call her B) could stay with me for the night. His parents wouldn’t let a girl stay over but B really needed a place to stay as her parents were abusing her. The girl B was staying with before kicked B out as well so B was basically going to have to sleep outside. I said that of course she could come over as long as she let me rest. I still wasn’t feeling very well and I was sore from the IV I got at the ER. I picked up B from Ryan’s house and took her to my house. (My mom wasn’t home as shes a flight attendant and is never home). I had meet B before but only at parties or when she was with Ryan. I let her shower and borrow some clean clothes for the first day of school the following day. In the morning I took her to school and even bought her lunch. She told me that she still didn’t have a place to stay and asked if she could stay a couple more nights until she either went home to her abusive parents or found another persons house to crash at. I let her stay two more nights when I started to lose it. She started to act like she lived at my houses. She worse my cloths with out asking, took showers when ever she wanted and even moved things around in the guest bedroom she was staying in. I had even given her an old phone to use and school supplies, she never said thank you once to me. She also borrowed my prom dress , with out asking, to wear on a date with Ryan. The breaking point for me was when she told me ,not asked, me if I could drive her to Ryan’s house and then to her house to pick up some of her things. I was still dealing with my mental heath issues and I still hadn’t healed physically all the way. At this point her three day stay and turned into a week and my mom was heading home. I finally broke down told her I wasn’t her Uber and told her to get out. I told her to call Ryan and that she needed to leave. I needed space and I couldn’t support her anymore. This really impacted my friendship with Ryan as he thinks I’m an asshole now and now B won’t even talk to me. Am I an asshole for kicking an abused girl out? "
1298,c3030w,"AITA? GF(28f) of three months is livid with me (25m) for telling her I want to go to one of my good friends wedding alone So one of my best friends is getting married in October and I am a groomsman in the wedding. This is my first time being in a wedding and the first wedding of one of my friends to attend. 

Now my best friend is an ex coworker of mine so we don’t see each other as often as we wish we could however we have a great friendship and keep in touch and hang out every now and then. 

The girlfriend has met said friend and fiancé and attended their St. Patty’s day party they hosted. She didn’t really bond with them as she had too much to drink and crutched on conversation with her friend she brought to the party. She also went to an Eric Church concert that I bought 6 tickets for and invited my friend and his fiancé. I thought this would be a great chance for them to click but in reality she really only spent the night doting on me while I was trying to have fun with my two friends and their significant others. 

Fast forward to this past weekend. She knows about the wedding and that I am a groomsman. She already assumes that she is going to the wedding as my date but asks me to confirm. I tell her rationally that I would prefer to go alone and give her several reasons that are logical in my mind:

1). She wouldn’t know anyone there and I, being in the wedding, wouldn’t be able to spend that much time with her
2). I want to give my full attention and time to my best friend on his special day

In the past when I’ve hung out with her and old friends I don’t get to see that often I get caught up in conversation with them and she feels neglected and takes it personally. 

That is why I want to attend dateless. So I can roam freely and enjoy myself while celebrating my best friend getting married without having to worry about if she is having a good time or her getting upset over me not having my full attention on her. 

I told her all this but she is still pissed. After three months of dating I feel like looking at an important event (to me) four months in advance and getting upset about my decision is irrational. 

AITA?

Edit: reason number 1. worded poorly (was not representative of what I told her) so changed “she wouldn’t know anyone there” to current version."
1299,e754yk,"AITA for snooping in my roommate’s room when I thought they took my stuff, even if I was right? The roommate has been taking things here and there since they’ve moved in.  They used to eat my food, but stopped eating the stuff I labeled.  They used some of my skin care stuff I had in the bathroom but stopped when I sent a general message out to the house group chat saying that someone was using it and I’d like it to stop.  It really irked me but since it’s stopped when I said something (stupid that I even had to in the first place but w/e) I was getting by, but then they took my other roommate’s pillows from the living room and have been ignoring her when she’s asked where they went (which has been 3x now). We can see them on their bed when we walk past the room, so we know they are in there.  

I had a candle in the living room that suddenly went missing, and because of the past incidents I suspected them.  After looking everywhere I knew it had to have been taken, so I bypassed asking and went into their room and found it on their dresser.  I didn’t know what to do because I didn’t want to admit that I snooped, so I messaged the group chat asking if anyone had seen it.  They said no, so I said that it had to be somewhere because I looked everywhere.  They sent me a picture of it behind a cat condo and said that they just found it there, and I told them that I just moved the cat condo there yesterday and it wasn’t there.  Then they said that they actually pulled it out from under the couch with a broom, and I said that it wasn’t under the couch either... I only know that because I snooped, so I feel very awkward trying to confront this.  

I’m trying to grow out of being passive aggressive, and I feel like the way I’m handling this is super passive aggressive. I was too nervous to confront this directly because I just expect to be talked out of being upset because of past assholes conditioning me to accept that.

I live with two roommates, we grew up together in a small town and the three of us were great friends,so we moved to the mid-west together and rented a house . One of the rules was that if he has anyone stay at the house longer then two weeks they have to pitch in for bills/rent. The lease states that we are to be the only people living in the house(the 3 of us), roommate(A) and I would make the exception if the person was willing to help out. Now, roommate (B) is the classic shitty roommate, cooking and not cleaning up after himself and his GF, leaving nasty food in the fridge, he doesn't clean house at all and he eats our food. He has a Dog and he doesn't train him so he is constantly getting into everything and chewing up the balusters to the stairs and random things he grabs from our rooms. Roommate (B) makes all kind of passive aggressive remarks about the cleanliness of the kitchen even after he is the one who makes the mess.

We have asked him on more than one occasion not to have his company over constantly. He always makes it seems like he is with the idea claiming "" Oh yeah bro, totally, I need some time to myself anyway."" He gives it maybe one day where he stays at her place and then they are right back to it.the worst part is that he makes really passive aggressive remarks about anything he can, and he does things to be spiteful. She has been here almost every day for the 3 months we have lived here. Now I would understand if they were in a long term relationship, but they have only been dating for the 3 months we have lived here. I'm sorry this is so drawn out, I'm really tired and frustrated.

A little background...

As kids me, my sister, and our siblings endured abuse and neglect and are still dealing with the fallout.

My sisters first marriage was so bad that dcfs told her to leave or they’d take her kid (Ex gave kid a forehead laceration). She left and took her kid with her.

Fast forward to yesterday and I see some pictures she and my niece are tagged in on fb and I’m flabbergasted.

Right in the background of the picture is our sisters ex (father of her first three kids) who was recently released from prison after serving a couple of years for felony child abuse and neglect.

My sister excused his behavior by saying his 4th child had failed to thrive and it was the moms fault for not taking the baby to the doctor.

I said since the parents lived together and we’re equally responsible for the child they were both guilty which is why they were both charged.

She maintains that he’s never hurt them (her or her child) and I say that if someone has an anger problem and went to prison over how they treated their own kid they can’t be trusted.

I also pointed out that our sister has called cps on her in the past for petty reasons when she gets mad and when she gets wind that they’re hanging out she’ll probably do it again. I also pointed out that if dcfs realizes she’s hangin out with him they won’t like it.

She says I’m wrong and she pissed at me.

I told her to tell her therapist and see what they say about the situation."
1302,9tr2y9,"AITA for wanting my boyfriend to not be on his phone when we go to bed at night? I really like falling asleep cuddling my boyfriend. I cherish the time we spend together in silence, just listening to each others breathing and drifting off to sleep. However, most nights he likes to watch YouTube videos until he falls asleep. I usually just lie next to him and fall asleep before he does while he is still on his phone. Sometimes I spoon him while he watches. His lack of attention towards me at bedtime makes me feel a little neglected... I think that this also affects our sex life because when he is distracted by his phone he doesn’t get turned on or initiate sex. It’s not like this is a problem all the time though, we still have sex fairly regularly. If I try to initiate sex he sometimes doesn’t notice cause he is too focused on the phone.  I have told him that I really wish he could fall asleep with me without using his phone but he tells me this is selfish because he enjoys his bedtime YouTube routine and this is what he used to do before we dated. AITA for thinking that falling asleep is something for couples to do together? Or am I just being needy and wanting his attention when I shouldn’t?"
1303,bx5vaq,"AITA for publicly calling out a liar? I'll go for brevity with this but I tend to ramble, so big fat soz if I go on too much. 

A few weeks ago I was introduced to a friend of a friend, let's call her Polly. I'm a paranoid schizophrenic, and the mutual friend who introduced us told me that Polly was too. Smashing, I thought, someone who gets it. Don't get me wrong, my friends and family are beautiful, understanding people, but I thought it'd be nice to finally have someone to talk to who has firsthand experience. 

No such luck. It became apparent to me rather quickly that Polly was lying. Suspicions initially arose for me when inconsistencies popped up in how she described her symptoms: first she claimed to have only auditory hallucinations, then she claimed to have both auditory *and* visual ones; first she said she'd had symptoms since she was 10, then they didn't start til she was 16. I kinda let that slide because hey, everyone's experience is different, sometimes symptoms *are* inconsistent and people make mistakes with info. But then there started to be other things. She told two different people that she'd been diagnosed at two different ages and gave two entirely separate stories about how she *got* the diagnosis. What sealed it for me was when she started talking about her ""new meds"". I asked her what she was on, and she said lithium. Now, lithium *is* sometimes used in treating schizophrenia, but it's pretty ineffective by itself and is used as a sort of add-on to antipsychotics, rather than being used as the sole treatment. I asked what else she was on and she said nothing, just lithium. 

I called her out on it, then and there. We were in a group of friends at the time. She tried to defend herself at first, so I pulled up the studies that showed the ineffectiveness of lithium as a standalone schizophrenia treatment and the need for it to be paired with antipsychotics. She admitted to lying, then started crying and said she only did it to seem interesting. I was pretty annoyed and told her that it's not on and there's no excuse and it's actually kind of offensive to those of us who *have* the disorder to pretend you have it to seem quirky and different. She ran off in tears. Our friends are in two camps; some of them think I was harsh and mean for showing her up snd then not really caring that she was crying and still telling her how wrong she was, others are telling me I did right by exposing her publicly. I'm curious as to what strangers think."
1304,arhbmu,"AITA for sending my boss a text without telling my mom when she told me not to Here's some background. I'm currently in highschool and have been looking for job. I just recently landed a job but I haven't begun to work yet and will be starting next week.

So here we go...

So my brother and I bought tickets to an event a month ago and the event is the weekend I will be starting my work. So I was like...

I should text my boss before he sends the schedule that I wont be able to come into work on Saturday right?

But my mom's like, no, don't do that, you'll get fired

At this point I'm like why? Isn't it better to let my boss know as early as possible??

My mom explained to me and my brother that because I haven't started to work yet, asking for a day off before even working will leave a bad impression and will get me fired.

I thought of it was somewhat reasonable??? This is my first real job BTW

My brother then explained that it's better to let my boss know before he sends the schedule so that my boss can work it out with that in mind.

My mom reasoned that because I haven't even worked yet, it wasn't okay. But if I were to already have been working there for a bit it would be acceptable. And then she goes on about that she personally would tell my boss and just drop the event for work.

My mom and my brother would argue a bit and I would be sitting there listening and texting my friends about the situation. They tell me that it should be totally fine to text my boss, so I thought about it and decided to send the text without my mom knowing.

I asked my mom again why couldn't just text my boss and she reasoned to me, slowly raising her voice. And while I was trying to reason with her, I told her I sent the text anyways so there isn't much you can do about it.

Everything goes downhill from here

My mom goes pretty much nuts. She goes on about why the hell I didn't listen to her and that I don't prioritize my studies and work and always play instead. I tell her that I finish all my work at school, that's why she doesn't see me working a lot at home. She goes on again that she would drop the event to work and emphasizes that I don't work enough. 

I told my mom this
I got straight A's last semester, I have 2 AP's and I've been working on work at school. Which may not seem like a lot to some people, which includes my mom.

She says that I have so much free time, why don't I take up another AP?

So I had a 3rd AP previously and I dropped it because I couldn't keep up with the HW load and was 3 assignments behind only a month into the semester so I dropped it.

But anyways, the conversation goes on about my grades, my responsibilities, my priorities and etc.

I asked why she was getting so worked up about it. It isn't her job, it's mine so therefore it is my responsibility and if I do end up fired, that's my problem not hers.

So at this point my mom threatens me by taking out all the money from my checking account and telling my brother that he will not be taking me out on Saturday.

So I don't rly remember when my dad got into this but he always takes my mom's side when we argue. He was saying that I don't listen to them but previously I was seriously taking everything into consideration before texting my boss.

I get a text from my boss saying that it's totally okay and third schedule's are very flexible, meaning that u have Saturday off to go to the event right?

But my mom was like, whether you have Saturday off or not, I will not let you go to the event. And then she told me to cancel the plans I had for the next day and proceeded to take all my money from my banking account.

So yeah, that happened. I tried making it simple without going too off track like the argument did about my grades and shit.

Td:lr I had plans on a weekend do I wanted to tell my boss at a new job that I could work on that one day, but my mom said not to do it cus I will get fired. I try to reason with her and ended up sending the text anyways and she gets mad at me, taking all my money out of my checking account and cancels the plans I had for the week.

Also here are some questions I think will be asked

My brother paid for both out tickets and my mom said she will be paying for them

I can't drive

So I order food tonight and I see the driver is arriving near my location. So I go wait in the living room. I’m waiting for about 5 minutes and I’m wondering what happened. He was about a minute away. So I’m sitting there and I look out the window and I didn’t see anyone. I’m like wtf so I go back to my room and see he texted me like 5 minutes ago saying “I’m here”

I go back to the living room and look out the window and nothing. So I go outside and see this car parked like 2 houses away. I didn’t know if it was him or not but I went over to it anyway. When I get there he looks upset and says “I was about to leave. I texted you that i was here” and then I say “I thought y’all were supposed to deliver it to my doorstep” and he goes “no we don’t you’re supposed to pick it up outside your house” 

At that point I’m already done with this dude, so I reach into my wallet and get out a $1 bill and give it to him. I tell him thanks and walk away. I don’t know why but his attitude bugged me, had I known he was gonna be that way I would have given him a quarter instead.

Am in the wrong here? Should I have still tipped him more?"

My uncle had a bad break up two years back and so he was living with my grandma (mums mum) and he was living there rent free. My mum had a problem with this and convinced my grandparents to kick him out of their home. He got really mad and now doesn't talk to anyone in my family... apart from me.
Last year on his birthday, I found his phone number buried in my mum's old laptop. I messaged him saying happy birthday and we began talking frequently. A year has passed and he has gotten rid of his phone number and given me his private email address. My mum found out and she doesn't want me speaking to him if he doesn't speak to her.

On a recent trip out of the country, my wife and I were at the Vancouver airport. We had checked our bags and had some time so we went to the duty free shop to buy some cheap booze. We grabbed a bottle of wine and headed to the lineup for the checkout. I idly noticed a carry on suitcase on wheels by itself about 5 or 6 feet away from the last person in line but I didn’t think anything of it and I got in line. About a minute later I hear somebody say “excuse me” so I turned around to see a girl who says “I’m ahead of you.” So I asked her how she came to that conclusion and she said she had left the suitcase to hold her spot while she did some more browsing. My immediate reaction was to say that her suitcase was not her, and it was several feet from the end of the line. She persisted, saying that I was in her spot but I held my ground and eventually just ignored her protests, at which point she said I was rude or something to that effect, while I consider her rude for just leaving a suitcase in the ground and taking her time browsing, and expecting people to let her in front of them whenever she decided to get back in line. Is this a thing?

1308,b7m8up,"AITA For hating my mom for making me share a bed with her So my mom and I have been living in a 1 bdrm for some years. I turn 17 in a few months. My mom first couldn’t afford to get a second bed when we first moved but i was young (9) so it didn’t matter. Once I turned maybe 13-14 I started to speak up at how most kids my age at least sleeps in their own bed.

Let me clarify we are in no way, shape, or form broke. My mom earns a decent amount of money every week. Each time she has an excuse as to why she can’t get a bed for me. I know I might sound ungrateful but there’s many reasons why I NEED my own bed at least. 

For one she snores, so there’s nights i’m up til 4 am tossing and turning. 2, she likes to cuddle me and I do not like that. I’ve told her maybe a 10-15 minutes is fine but not no 2-3 hours. She’ll get angry at me and call me selfish for not wanting to hug/cuddle her. 

We’ve got a futon couch in the living room. But i can’t sleep there because she says it’ll ruin it... even though it’s made for sleeping. There’s been nights that I slept on the floor in order to get a good nights rest. 

I don’t want to make it seem like I hate her with every bone in me because i don’t. I just hate her for making me share a bed with her for almost 10 years. She even brags about it to others like it’s something to be proud of. “Well MY daughter and I still sleep together” it’s quite embarrassing.

1309,e76mze,"AITA for saying children's gifts are unfair to others in secret santa. I was asked to join a neighborly secret santa. I said fuck it, why not. We had a budget of 10 bucks. Okay fair enough. However one thing that irked me is that after we drew names, they mentioned the neighbors kids would also be participating, while also mentioning homemade gifts as an option. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now as far as i'm concerned I don't care if I get anything, but I feel like this is gonna lead to disappointment when we do the gift exchange and everyone is handing out gifts they bought and a few people are gonna be walking away with some kid drawings. It seems unfair due to the principle of the thing. I said that if children wanted to have a secret santa they should have their own with each other with only home-made gifts so it's fair. I mentioned this to some people and was called a greedy asshole, even after I said I don't care if I get anything. 

&#x200B;

I just think it seems unfair for some to be buying something nice or at least useful. (I have no idea what the person I drew likes so I bought a fancy box of chocolate I hope she likes it.) And you get some homemade thing that you'll probably pin to your fridge for a while."
1310,dxrp0l,"AITA For Not Letting A Student Participate In Class Anymore? I'm a prof and one of the classes I'm teaching this term is a business class focused on start ups. The class is a 4th year level class so I expected a lot of participation from students in class since they are upper years and because its worth 20% of their grade. I have one student lets call him Bob, Bob is always answering all my questions, always has an opinion etc. He's usually correct and has decent opinions on issues we speak about but its just too much. He basically can go on a monologue in class and by answering all my questions even when he puts his hand up and I don't say his name he basically hogs all the participation points from the class. Another thing to note its a 18 person class with about 3 young men and 15 young women and I feel like Bob creates an environment where the women in the class feel shy to participate because sometimes he'll have a counter argument to their opinion or answer and they feel weird about that which is understandable. I want to give the girls in the class more of a voice and show them that participating in these classes will make them more confident and provide a better learning experience.

The tipping point was last Tuesday where I organized a quiz show like class to test the class about the things we've learned over the semester so far. I put Bob into a group with 3 other girls and guess what he basically answered all the questions in the quiz where I had to say ""Ok Bob give another person in the class a turn to answer or another person in your group to answer"". I spoke to him after class and informed him that I'll give him 90-100% for participation for the semester but I don't want him really speaking too much anymore as I want to get others opinions. He seemed kinda bummed out but happy he's gonna get high on the participation part of his overall grade.

I told my friend about this and he said that was a asshole move and its not his fault that he's smarter than the rest of the class and wants to participate. He also said it was sexist because I wanted to get the young women in the class involved more.

I never really told my parents as I figured they knew (the dad is in jail for drug charges, and it was kinda a big thing in our small town)

2 nights ago I was going through Instagram when I saw that my sister had uploaded a Instagram story, it was her and the girls I mentioned walking around town. 
all the girls (5 of them) are all aged around 14/15 years old and it was around 12:00pm in the city. 

my sister did not look drunk but some of the other girls clearly did, so I used the I phone screen record thing and sent the video to my mom. 

they where incredibly thankful and sent the video to the mums of the other girls. 

my sister found out I did it and told the other girls, I am now the literal embodiment of satan (sisters words) and the other girls that got caught up in this absolutely hate my guts. 

my friends have also taken my sisters side telling me that I'm a snitch and need to back off. 

I did not do it to get her in trouble I just wanted her to be safe and as she refuses to listen to me I figured my parents had to know. 

I'm 17f btw

I've been messing around with my female friends but they know its nothing more then sex.
Now I'm more out and about in the world and while I am open to dating, that's just it. 
I'm open to dating. Not long term commitment,  not a full blown relationship. 
Just small dates like going to concerts, movies, chilling on the weekends and slowly go from there if I like her.

My friend introduced me to this girl who was a friend of his girlfriend.
 immediately I felt attracted to and i can tell she immediately liked me back once we started talking.
She told me about her exes and how bad her last relationship was and I felt a little turnt off. 
Not because she's a bad person or anything.
From how she was talking to me i can tell if anything happened between us, she's looking for a serious relationship and I'm not.
I figured I'd make my intentions known now and I told her I'm not really looking for a girlfriend. I honestly just want someone I can chill with, establish a friendship and maybe sex if she's interested and if I like her we'll go from there and she seemed like she was ok with that and asked me if I wanted to see a movie to which I agreed.
Fast forward. 
We been hanging out for two weeks when she texted me on last week how did I feel about her.
I knew what she meant and although I liked her, I  wasn't interested in dating so I friendzoned her.
I responded honestly 
""I think you're a great person, and I wish I could offer you more but, im just not ready for a serious relationship which I believe you want. Unfortunately, I can't give that to you. I would still like to be friends but if not I understand and will respect your choice"".
She wrote back asking if she did something wrong and I told her
""No, its not you. Im just not ready for commitment right now"".
She then tells me she'll wait for me and that she wants a relationship with me and she'll wait as long as she has too. 
I asked her not to wait for me and she ignored me basically. 
So she's been texting me and I haven't responded to any of them.

1313,d8yzey,"AITA for not letting my sister's friend have the TV? This happened a few months ago but I can't sleep tonight and it popped into my head. I love this sub but have never posted in it and I'm curious what an unbiased third-party thinks.

I currently live with my mother, sister and girlfriend. My sister has a friend named Jill. Jill comes from a wealthy-ish family. She never wanted for anything and she doesn't have many bills or responsibilities and it makes her a little bit entitled. (I promise this is pertinent.) 

A few months ago, Jill came over on a Sunday night to watch Game of Thrones. Our family has always been struggling lower-class but my mother has always been a huge TV person so we have subscriptions to most premium channels, including HBO. Jill had made a plan to come over and use our HBO to watch GoT, something she'd done before. My girlfriend and I were downstairs watching American Idol when Jill arrived and my sister informed us that Jill would be taking over the downstairs TV. (In our home, only the living room TV has cable hookup. The other TVs use Chrome Cast or Firestick for streaming.)

I said no. American Idol is a live show with voting and we wanted to watch it live. My girlfriend and I pay rent and that means we can watch TV if we want. My sister begins to get annoyed. I offer that Jill is more than welcome to watch GoT when Idol was over (since she knew she'd be running late, my sister DVRed the show.) Jill said she had to get up early and didn't want to wait til 11 and ""stay up that late."" (It was probably 10:20 by this time.) I told her I wasn't changing it and they both stormed upstairs.

5 minute later my sister texts me and says ""If she can't watch it down there, one of you needs to give her your laptop to watch it up here."" I was baffled because that isn't usually my sister's style. I ask her why Jill can't use HER laptop and my sister said it was because she was using her laptop to stream Walking Dead.

Now, my laptop is extremely old and cannot handle streaming. My girlfriend's laptop would have been fine but she barely knows Jill so it seemed really weird for her to just hand over her laptop for an hour while an acquaintance-at-best watches Game of Thrones.

I'm frustrated because Jill has her own laptop at home, and the capabilities to get her OWN HBO subscription, but she and my sister want ME to leave the room in the middle of something I'm watching to cater to her.

I tell my sister it's not going to happen and the two end up huffing and storming out to go to Jill's and watch it there.

And I want to know, AITA? Was I overreacting? Should I have just let her watch the show and gotten over it, be the bigger person? (I am the older sister, after all.) It just rubbed me the wrong way. At no point did anyone ASK for anything. Everything was demanded and EXPECTED. This was back in April or May but it still makes me wonder.

1315,dza8vb,"AITA: for not wanting to name my baby after my gf’s dead mom? My gf and I are expecting. We’ve been together for around 2 years and this baby wasn’t exactly planned but it also isn’t unwelcome. I am super excited to be a dad and we have good jobs, live in a big enough house, and are old enough to be ready to make sacrifices that a baby brings. 
 We’ve talked about mutually wanting kids and have made mention of agreeing on some things like discipline and such but as far as details, there was nothing. So as far as names I had never heard her have any preference and I’ll be honest, I’ve never thought about it much myself. 

When we told her family they were all overjoyed and immediately brought up how if it was a girl her named would be (for the sake of this post, this isn’t the real name) Holly. After my gf’s mom who passed away in a car crash when my gf was 15. I brought up (alone with her, not everyone) that we really wouldn’t be naming the baby Holly right? And she looked at me like I was crazy and said we “absolutely 100%” would be naming the baby Holly if it’s a girl. 

Now the issue here is Holly is my longterm exes name. We did NOT have a healthy relationship and in fact she for lack of a better term stalked me after our relationship was over causing crippling anxiety before I decided to attend therapy and get a restraining order. But let’s just say it was at the level where I had to move my home in the middle of the night so she wouldn’t know my address. The name only has absolute horrible memories for me and I do not want to name my child this. My friends & family also knows what terrible time I went through and I think they would be completely weirded out by me having a daughter named this. 

My gf knew my story with my ex and knew that her mom and my ex shared the same name but she had never in the past brought up the idea that our future child would have to have the name. Not once. 

We just did the gender scan 2 days ago and of course, it’s a girl. I’m super excited about having a girl but I won’t lie if I wanted to throw up at the idea of having to approach this subject again with my gf. 

So I really sat down with her and explained in detail how awful my relationship was with my ex. All the crazy she put me and everyone I knew through and how naming this baby her name is just not something I’m okay with. I said that I would be willing to name our daughter her mom’s middle name, shit, anything other then Holly. 

I was told that the baby is being made in her body and coming out her vagina and in the end I need to “get over my past” and realize this isn’t just about me but how her mom can’t experience this with her and how much the name means to her and her family. 

I tried to gently point out that this baby was also 50% me and how is it fair to make me this uncomfortable with something to dealing with my child and that got a response of, “You need to grow up.” And then she started to cry. 

So I guess am I the asshole here?"

My ex wife and I were married for 4 years. She had two daughters with her ex husband. They were 3 and 5 when we got married. After our marriage, I came to know that she basically cheated on her ex husband, which lead to their divorce. 

In retrospect, I think that our marriage was kind of doomed from the begging. Our marriage consisted of her wallowing in self pity about how her infidelity destroyed her marriage and her girls and me consoling her everyday. 

She refused to discipline the girls because she felt she was was responsible for hurting and I couldn't do anything because I was not the dad. 

Finally, she decided to get back with her ex husband and cheated on me with him. I was kind of relieved that our relationship ended. I did everything I could for the girls but their dad always managed to paint me as an asshole. So I stopped trying to do anything and just provided for them. 

Now after a couple of months, my ex calls me and tells me that her daughters want to see their stepdad. That's me. I was surprised because they never appreciated what I did for them. Long story short, things did not work out for the ex husband and my ex wife and they broke up again. 

So I told her that they only wanted to see me because their dad kicked them out and told her not to call me again. She called my mom about it and my mom thinks I was inconsiderate. AITA here?"

My parents went through my journal and found some stuff that they didn’t like (gender/sexuality).  Since then, several threats have been made, including disowning me, making me pay for school, psychiatric treatment, meds, etc, taking me out of school to work for them (basically slavery), cutting off all connection to the outside world, conversion therapy, and basically making my life miserable.  Obviously, I don’t like that, so I’ve been pretty frustrated with them, especially my dad.  I go to school, and my only sibling (m12) is homeschooled, like I was last year.  However, even though I now go to a school an hour from home, my chores haven’t been reduced at all, and between taking care of myself, homework, and chores, I’m often overwhelmed.  Thus, I’ve been slacking some on my chores because they’re what directly affects me the least.  But this pisses my parents off, and they say again and again that I’m not contributing enough to the family, despite not treating me like family.  Lately, my mom made me look into driver’s ed (I’m not eligible for a permit for 6 months), and when I protested due to the fact that we’re probably moving out of state soon and anything I did here wouldn’t count, she said that I had to so that she could get a job.  I asked why she needed a job, and she stated it was so that my dad would lay off of her and so she’d have more spending money.  So basically I would be a shuttle for my brother while in school and working. So I told her I wasn’t starting before the summer and I knew if we were moving.  She hasn’t talked to me all day except texting me all day to pick out flaws in my chores, room, etc, and then didn’t pick me up from school, meaning I had to go to my friends swim practice if I wanted to get home (did I mention school is an hour away).

1318,dvkxon,"WIBTA if I told my teacher about the work imbalance for my school project? I’ll try to keep this as short as I can. Last Monday in my high school, we were assigned a project for my health class where we had to research certain organ diseases and create a pamphlet on it. Partners were assigned randomly, and I got assigned with a jock. We did notes in class Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. I waited until Sunday to start working on it again (it was due Tuesday (today)). I told him I’ll do the design and I’ll transfer his notes over to the project, all he has to do is the citations (convert them to APA format). 


He was busy Sunday, which is understandable. On Monday, I spent over 4 hours doing the project and finishing the design. He sends me over his notes (which I had to correct because they were lacking- for example, one thing asked for three treatments, he only listed 1, etc. stuff like that. The notes weren’t horrible but they were lacking in some areas). I had no problem doing the design part if he could have just done the citations in APA format. 


I ask him Monday night if he’s finished, but he hasn’t and said he’ll send them Tuesday morning. Tuesday morning (today) I find out he couldn’t convert half of them on the converter, so he asks the teacher if he could get until tomorrow to do the citations; he said ok. I ask him tonight to send them over, and I’ll format them into the project so they can match it, low and behold- he hasn’t done them. I’m stuck doing all of them and I’m really mad I spent five hours doing this entire project over the past 2 days while he hasn’t done what I had asked him.


Like I said, I was ok with the work being slightly imbalanced- I was fine spending more time doing the design, all I needed was his notes and for him to do the citations. Not only did I have to correct his notes, I had to do the citations too. He also told me really late- I’ll probably have to stay up late just to finish the citations. You can understand why this is frustrating. This is a project worth 60 summative points, and since it was supposed to be partner you can understand how unfair it feels. 


I was thinking about telling my teacher tomorrow about the work imbalance, but I’m debating it since I’m afraid of looking like a tattle tale/ asshole, especially over a stupid high school project. Reddit, WIBTA if I told him?"
1319,ctcr0o,"AITA for refusing to comply to a customer's demands So I work at a coffee shop kinda similar to Starbucks so the quality of our goods isn't amazing and it's a bit overpriced for what it is but generally everyone likes what we have to offer and nobody complains too much.

Enters this family, roughly , eight customers, who proceeds to order a bunch of things during a slight rush. So I take everyone's orders, my coworker works on all the drinks. Everyone is served and hopefully happy. This guy then comes back with two of the drinks saying they weren't strong enough. I asked him to elaborate and he just said they didn't taste enough like coffee. Me and my coworker suggested to add an extra espresso shot to make it stronger. He agrees for only one of the two drinks. For the other one, he wants a completely different drink.

Here enters the debate. For context, I have a tendency to be passive aggressive when I'm asked to do something that doesn't make sense. In my opinion, the guy wanted a different drink because he didn't like the previous one and expected me to just comply to his complaints and make him this unrelated drink that has nothing to do with the first one. He also told me that he's never been to our chain of coffee shop before and that he's had the same drink but at different types of coffee shops. So quoting him ""I want you to turn this drink into another drink"". So I told him ""So what you're telling me to do, is to throw this drink out, make you a new drink, free of charge, because you aren't happy with this first drink?""

At this point, the tension is relatively high, I end up telling him that I can make him a different drink if he pays for it. He then explodes telling me I don't know how to run a coffee shop. That I have no experience as a barista. That I should make him a new drink. At this point I kinda stopped listening but I did hear him ask if him telling me that our coffee is garbage would make things any better? So me being me replies ""Well now you know not to order that drink anymore since you don't like it"" He demands a refund. I refund him the two drinks. His wife kinda butts in to complain but he just tells her that I won't listen anyways. Which is kinda true, I was set not to make him a new drink unless he paid for it. The family doesn't leave right away so I see him staring at me silently while typing something on his phone. Of course it's a negative Google review.

Here is the review: ""The kid (just have to say I'm obviously not a kid, not that it matters but I have a full beard and a lot of people tell me I look like I'm in my mid twenties) working here is under the impression that a refund is cheaper then correcting the coffee. He refused to fix what we found wrong with two of the seven drinks we ordered""

In my opinion, it's not refusing to fix a drink if you want me to make a new drink

AITA?

Edit: -None of the supervisors were working that day.
-The drink the guy wanted in exchange is at most 50¢ cheaper. Can't recall the specific prices"

We have a son together who is 5, and he isn’t exactly the more active co-parent. However, as I hope most of you will agree, it is not my job to influence the relationship they have together, so I don’t tell my 5 year old degrading things about his father as, quite frankly, that’s just fucking disrespectful. 

My sons birthday just passed, and my ex called and plans on taking him out at some point ( don’t know when because he tends to be inconsistent), and my son was upset about it. I explained to him before that his father has to work hard just like mommy so he has “ a great future ahead”. 

They just talked on the phone, and my son told him that he was upset that he missed his birthday, and he has a tendency to exaggerate so he said “ you missed too many of my birthdays!” And I didn’t correct him because it wasn’t my discussion, it was between him and his father. I did, however, tell him to watch his tone of voice. 

His father talks it out with him and precedes to get pissy because I didn’t intervene and correct him. I told him that it was THEIR DISCUSSION. Mommy isn’t always going to be there to be a social buffer, and he is nearing the time where he will be in conflicts and have to communicate his feelings. I think communicating your feelings, especially in boys, isn’t always taught, as men are sometimes expected to be “ strong and tough”; I don’t want my kid holding himself to that standard, and I want him to feel comfortable communicating how he feels and interprets things. 

So, am I the asshole for not intervening and letting them have their discussion and resolve it? "
1322,b19nmm,"AITA for breaking up with my girlfriend after he came out to me as being a guy? Heyo not sure if the title made sense but here's the jist of it

&#x200B;

Couple weeks ago my (Ex) girlfriend came out to me and told be that he was a guy (Gender wise, physically is a girl mentally isn't, and was a girl when i was dating him) . After a few days of deep thinking and a night out with the boys I decided that the best way for me to respect his decision was to break up with him for i am straight and i am a guy and therefore i like girls and he isn't a girl so therefore i'm not attracted to him.  I felt really bad and still do, i made sure to let him know to talk to me if he needed anything and he seemed to understand why i did what i did. But guess who didn't?

The GSA club at my school.

The GSA club at my school has a huge influence on who is hated and who is supported and can quickly ruin one's reputation, soon after i broke up with my gf (IBUWGF) his new GSA friends ( Since he was trans he quickly very much supported by GSA (As he deserves to be)) started to call me Sexest, homophobic, trans-phobic and racist (idk why racist i guess if i was sexist and homophobic why not add in race)  all because i broke up with a newly trans guy.  This made it so most girls at my school wouldn't talk to me and my friends were afraid to be associated with me anymore

&#x200B;

Am i the Asshole or are they (GSA)?

&#x200B;

(I have nothing against gay, trans or other LGBTQ+ people)

Edit 1: Please follow rule 1 of AITA and Please Respect his pronouns (use him he his)

TL;DR: Broke up with my girlfriend after they turned to a guy and the GSA club  at my school said that i was an asshole for it, are they right?

1323,bv9tzj,"AITA for not letting my abusive parents back into my life? I (21M) have been living on my own for three years now. The only reason I’ve been living on my own is because as soon as I graduated high school, my parents kicked me out. Our issues with each other go back a long way, ever since I can remember really. The majority of our fights revolved around minor issues getting completely blown out of proportion due to arguing, and my parents’ unchecked anger issues (I wrote a full, detailed story on this a month or two ago, feel free to go check it for the whole thing on my account). 

Some of the abuses included:

-Pulling me off of a school-sanctioned spring break, AFTER I had paid $1000 of my own money, and was never refunded. They used this as blackmail to get me to behave for months.

-Removing me from school clubs like academic quiz team or marching band (like, how is that even reasonable?)

-Throwing a kitchen knife at me during a heated argument 

And a few other notables. I have very few positive memories of actually interacting with them, and so many bad ones.

On the other hand, I’ve had 3 years to grow and change since then (they contacted me again about 2 years after me being kicked out to apologize and try to reconnect) and since then I went to one or two family events, mostly just to see my grandparents. In that time, I learned that they didn’t necessarily hate me, but they were very antisocial, impersonal, and argumentative people, and I was an argumentative child. They fed me, put me through school and kept me safe until I was at least a little prepared to be on my own. They had been threatening to kick me out for a long time, but seemed to wait until I had a job and a car before finally giving me the boot (could still be purely coincidence). 

They haven’t explicitly said that they wish they could see more of me (not really in their nature to do so) but I can definitely feel like I’m being softly guilted for not doing so. I don’t think I’m still angry at them anymore, and they have no more power to abuse me like they have, but after 18 years of bad memories, there’s no positive foundation to build off of. I know nothing about them as people and they know nothing about me.

So, AITA for keeping my parents in the dark about my life? Should I distance myself further or try to make amends?"
1324,ch3e2i,"AITA for walking out of a car dealership without any notice? I recently just got my license and was going to start looking at cars that I could afford to purchase. I have never been to a car dealership and my dad gave me warnings that the salesmen can be very scary and deceiving sometimes, and I should always have my ""poker face on.""  I went with my dad to a dealership and test drove a car that was in my budget. The car drove nicely, but I was not a fan of the color of the car. I expressed my opinion on the color, but the salesman must've thought it wasn't a big deal.

We eventually got sucked into the building where we starting to do paperwork just to see what he could do for me and how low of a price he could get. After filling out some stuff he got up and went into the back of the building, but I'm honestly not too sure where he even went. While he was gone I told my dad we should maybe go and look at more cars because I wasn't content with this car just yet. He didn't mind and told me to go and find the guy and tell him we were going to go look at other options for now.

Now I could not find this salesman at all. I went through all the glass cubicles they had and didn't see him anywhere, I walked back to my dad and he decided it was okay to leave the dealership and go look at other cars at other dealerships. We drove off and eventually started to receive several phone calls from the dealership. They also sent a text, but it was not the same salesman we had been with, it was someone else at the dealership. He basically asked us where we went, and I just responded with, ""So sorry, looked all over to try to find \[salesman\], but couldn't find him so we just left to look for other options for now."" He sent a text back saying how rude we were and how he's never had a customer ever do that to them and how we wasted their time. I understood we probably shouldn't have left without saying anything, but I'm not too experienced with car dealerships. AITA?"

1326,ce59bs,"AITA for not wanting a relationship with my mom anymore? I'm 21, and I was born with a severe medical condition that requires me to be on TPN for the rest of my life. Due to medical negligence, I lost all my sites as a toddler so my mom had to learn it all in a very short time period to keep me alive with the single site I have left. I literally owe my life to her, and for that I will forever be grateful to her.

After I married my wife my mom said she'd NEVER do my medical care because my mom didn't trust my wife not to mess it up and kill me. This didn't bother us because all our needs were being met at the time.

Then my dad died and my mom got remarried. My mom immediately dumped all of my care on my untrained wife and my 1 nurse. My mom refused to teach my wife because she was busy, so the nurse had to teach her on top of now needing to work 7 days a week.

My mom was rarely home, but when she was she and her new husband would criticize the smallest of things me and my sisters would do. It got to the point where we needed to move for our sanity, but we couldn't because she convinced me when I was younger that it was ""just easier"" if my SSI was deposited directly into her account. 

She also refused to consider my SSI rent (SSI increases if you pay rent depending on how much rent you pay), instead considering money I owed her as payment towards family expenses like toilet paper. Which she didn't buy anyway. We were given $85/mo to spend, this is all we had to spend for food, which was never available in the family fridge so my wife was basically forced to eat once a day, twice if we were lucky.

My mom didn't take care of me for free by the way, she got paid by the state for it, as well as getting 100% of my SSI which was over $500/mo.

She'd get pissed at home that she had all these disabled kids to take care of and refuse to deal with us, but the second she was with people outside of the house she'd play it for pity and sympathy. Even after she had nothing to do with my care she acted like she was some infallible woman who could do no wrong. Any disagreement was disrespectful and she'd gaslight us all constantly.

Once we finally ended up moving out we decided to cut her out of our lives completely for the way she treated us and my sisters. People are divided on this."

She was a great girl, super down to earth and a bit shy but we all liked her. So here’s a summary of the drama our cheater started to mess around with one of he’s coworkers and got caught by keila ( another friend of ours) at the movies with this girl that wasn’t he’s girlfriend. Keila told some people and eventually I found out,now I didn’t do anything at first because 1. I didn’t see anything, 2. I had no Proof 3. It wasn’t my business. Fast forward a few months cheater is still with girlfriend, and I am hosting a BBQ everyone was invited and this stupid piece of garbage brings his coworker to my place. At first we’re all shocked and just let things happen, they start getting all touchy-feely and I was done, I pulled him over and asked him what the hell was he doing? He told me to chill and to be a good friend and not say anything. I told them to leave and he got pissed to the point other people had to intervene to get him out. A few days later I texted girlfriend and asked her to please meet with me and that it was important. We told her everything Selene( another friend) shows her a video she took of them being all  touchy-feely and we all apologized. She broke up with him and almost everyone in our friend group deleted or  blocked him.  2 or 3 years has passed already and I ran into him and we had a little small talk. He asked if we could catch up sometimes and I immediately said no and made up the excuse that I’ve been super busy and have no free time. He told me to stop lying and if I really was going to throw away about 6 good years of friendship. I said  The only thing I was throwing away was a toxic person that I wanted nothing to do with. He Continues to say it was one mistake and how judgmental we all were to just stop talking to him. I told him that he has to live with what hes did and except the consequences. He kept arguing that it wasn’t fair that he lost all his friends and I just told him to have a good life and walked away.

I (F22) needed some cash so I was considering getting a loan form a bank. I am pursuing a Masters. I asked a friend of mine (M23) if he knew where to get a good rate, and to my surprise, he offered to loan me the $10,000 I seeked (1 year term).

He told me that he ""would beat the banks"" and offered me a rate of 1.75%. I was taken aback, since that is below inflation. I told him that it seemed low but he was okay, saying that he would ""rather help than exploit a friend"". I borrowed the money and very much expressed my gratitude for his help.

&#x200B;

However, my boyfriend (M22) said that I took advantage of my friend's socialism - that he would feel compelled to lend at a low rate since he always rants about billionaires, bankers, etc. And that I should have paid him a better rate so that ""I am not taking advantage of him"" and by borrowing at a rate under inflation ""I am coming out on top"".

However, I think I did nothing wrong. I didn't even ask my friend for a loan, he offered it. He seemed more than happy to give it at a 1.75% rate and I even checked that he was sure.

Today my girlfriend got a text from her parents saying that they’re coming to visit on Saturday, they’re driving down from their hometown which is ~4 hours away. Needless to say, this is completely untenable for me. I’ve got an exam next Tuesday that’s worth 35% of my final grade and it’s not an exaggeration to say that my hopes getting into grad school totally depend upon doing well in this class...I don’t have a bad grade, it’s over 80 but maintaining good grades is the hardest part of getting good grades. On top of that I’m also working on a 6000 word term paper. I haven’t had time to study for my exam cause I’ve got 2 exams this week Thurs/Fri that I’ve been studying all week for. On top of that I have a directed studies research project that I’m working on.

This is made even worse by the fact that they want to spend the whole day at a winery and I just. Cannot. Do. It. And she doesn’t get it. She said, “are you seriously going to skip out on this to go do whatever?” And I was just floored. I mean completely floored, because I felt like she isn’t respecting my needs.

They were going to stay at my girlfriend’s house (they’re wealthy and bought it for her to stay in while she’s  in uni) and they weren’t flying so there’s not anything to rebook. I tried to communicate this with my girlfriend and she didn’t take any of it in and painted me as an asshole who wants to blow off her and her parents. She even had the nerve to say that since I’ve got an 87 in the class then I won’t need to study at all.

That was honestly the last straw for me and I excused myself saying I need some space to think about things for a while and she’s been blowing up my phone ever since.

1330,ctyqwf,"AITA for not attending my sister's wedding? So I've always had a rocky relationship with most of my family. I moved to a different state as soon as I turned 18 and to a different country after I finished university.

For the last year I've been trying to strengthen my relationship with my family after years of non-communication. It's been difficult, but I thought fruitful.

I recently found out from an extended family member that my sister is engaged and had a date set. This isn't something she told me about or invited me to. When my dad brought it up to me (assuming I'd talked to my sister) I told him I wouldn't be able to attend.

Her wedding is scheduled for my first week at a brand new job. On top of that, I live on a different continent than them. This company is a huge step up for me, and my sister's wedding is scheduled during the most important week of the year in my work.

I've spent the last four years working my way up in my field and know that requesting this week off would sincerely jeopardize my job and possibly my career. On top of that, attending the wedding would be an extravagant expenditure for me- about 2 months of salary, as it's a destination wedding. 

I was able to have a discussion with my sister who did not take the news well. There were a lot of tears and it was emotional for both of us. She was pretty angry and told me how embarrassed she would be not to have me attend.

She told me that my parents would help me fiscally but I don't want to take their money. I don't feel comfortable with the way it changes their relationship to me and I don't feel comfortable with that at all. My mother brought up a bill for the ER she paid for three years once.

I've tried to compromise by saying I'd visit at Christmas, but that didn't seem to be a happy resolution on their side. In the end, she told me she didn't want to hear why I couldn't come, just that I couldn't come. She also apologized for never telling me she was engaged. We both promised to try to keep in touch more. Since then I've sent her two or three messages and have had pretty tepid and delayed responses. She hasn't reached out at all.

Since then, my mother has sent me more than a few emails calling me ""hurtful, embarrassing, angry, etc"". So I think it's safe to say there's some unresolved anger on their side.

It looks like they aren't happy with my decision, but I'm not willing to risk my job / go into emotional or fiscal debt for this. AITA?"
1331,c8e3mj,"AITA for not giving my ""friend"" a ride home with a malfunctioning car? Last week a group of friends and I went to a college orientation about 3 hours from our hometown. Our parents drove us.

In the middle of orientation, my mom says she has an urgent meeting immediately after orientation ends, so we can take my friend Rachel back home if she wants. I tell Rachel this before she buys a more expensive bus ticket (she already bought a cheaper bus ticket beforehand) and she says 'sure'. At the time I didn't know there was an expensive bus and cheap bus. All I knew was that she already had a ticket and it didn't cross my mind as to why she was buying two tickets.

Hours later, I get a message from my mom saying that the car broke down and wasn't safe. Knowing Rachel's family, I knew they wouldn't like this, and since Rachel's mom is a lawyer, I felt that her family would very much sue.

So I told Rachel (honestly last minute) that we couldn't take her. Unexpected things happen so I thought Rachel would understand that the car situation was out of my control. Rachel would be fine since her future roommate would be on the bus, as well as Rachel's friend, Veronica, and Veronica's older brother who had ridden that bus multiple times. Rachel gave me the impression that it was okay I couldn't take her.

Fast forward to the last day of orientation. I call Rachel at 1 pm to tell her I was leaving, and my family and I did run into some major car problems on the way home. 

At 5 pm Rachel texts me asking if I'm still at orientation. I immediately think this is weird because she knows I left. She explains they missed the bus and have to wait for a 10 pm bus. I knew she was trying to guilt-trip me but I didn't see how I did anything wrong.

Fast forward to today. I talked to her about it with her. I knew before we started this conversation that Rachel didn't want to work this out. She just wanted me to admit it was my fault. I apologized to her, but I didn't say that I thought I was in the wrong. Rachel has problems with her friends for only seeing things her way, and ignoring them if they don't see her way. Nobody has the guts to stand up to her or argue with her, and we're all annoyed by this. We **never** call her out for her behaviour and the way she treats us.

So I stood up to her.  She could have gone home with her boyfriend, but she didn't want to and chose the bus. Because I wouldn't admit how wrong I was for ""ditching"" her, she hates me and all of this was my fault.  I've never had anyone hate me in my entire life. She's been one of my bffs for 4 years and just threw it away in a 15-minute convo. Why would I give her a ride knowing full well of how dangerous it is? She already had the bus ticket originally so I don't see how I screwed her over in any way.

Some of my friends are saying good riddance and that she was unreasonable but idk I just wished I didn't offer her anything in the first place. At first, I was upset that she was mad at me, but now I'm just really disappointed and shocked."
1332,dyp8fy,"WIBTA if I stopped letting my friend come to my concerts Backstory: I’m a musician in a cover band. We play out pretty regularly (4-6 times a month usually) and pretty much all of our gigs are at bars and clubs. We have one friend, let’s call him Pete, that comes to basically every single show. We appreciate the support, but at a certain point, it’s a little odd since we play the same songs and he hasn’t really missed any shows in the last year.

When we first started playing these shows, we really appreciated Pete coming out so often. We know that he doesn’t have a lot of friends, he had a rough childhood and coming out means a lot to him. Over the last year or so of Pete coming out to these bar gigs 4-6 times a month, he’s developed a pretty extreme drinking habit. Sometimes he controls himself and doesn’t get too sloppy, sometimes he falls asleep on the bar or gets sick in the bathroom or just gets really difficult to take care of. 

This would all be none of our business considering he is an adult and he should be allowed to drink as he pleases on the weekends to let loose and have a good time. That’s why we play our shows in the first place. But the problem is that Pete always drives to our shows. We have had to take his keys or just generally get mad at him and hope for the best as he makes his way home. He has a very large budget for weekend partying, so all of us have suggested that he pre-game at home and then spend what he would have saved on drinks getting an Uber home or something. He refuses and assures us that he can take care of himself. But at least for me, I’m getting pretty sick of worrying about him and I’ve been feeling like an enabler by allowing him to keep coming out to our shows and doing this. It’s not that I don’t trust him or that I think he has bad intentions, but it’s hard to trust anyone in that state of mind. 

So my question is, WIBTA if I stopped letting him come to our shows? And if not, how could I bring it up to make it seem like we aren’t trying to dump him as a friend? 

Tl;dr my friend has a habit of coming out to my shows and getting drunk and driving home."

He suddenly goes ""hello??"" I told him I was listening, and he responded with ""well make eye contact with me then"" in a kind of aggressive tone. 

I have NEVER had a customer complain about this before, and it's not like I NEVER make eye contact, I just tend to make it for a second and look away, because constant eye contact makes me uncomfortable. 

Another customer kind of laughed and told him ""good for you"" and that just made me wonder, am I being an asshole for not making constant eye contact when a customer is talking?

My husband (31m) and I (27f) have been married for a little over a year, been together for about 4. I wanna start off by saying that we are also best friends and haven't really had an issue like this before.   

   My husband, who we'll call Allen, is on the autistic spectrum and struggles with his emotions and with negative thoughts. He's been on a medication for the last couple of years that helps him look at issues more objectively and without as much clouding, but I noticed lately he has been getting more distressed at things I consider minor inconveniences. Whenever I notice these behavioral shifts, I ask him if he is okay and if he took his meds he always says yes of course and that he is just having a bad day. He has never lied to me before that I know of and I usually feel I can trust him.   

  It all kind of came to a head this morning when we were getting ready for work and he was getting super frustrated over a small leak under the bathroom sink. I decided to ask him flat-out if he had taken his meds that morning, and he said no and shuffled around in the drawer for them and pulled them out of a tiny travel bag I know he doesn't use daily. I asked him if he had been taking them consistently and he finally admitted he hadn't because he doesn't like them and doesn't want to and he has the right not to. 

     I got really upset over it and definitely cried a little bit (I'm a crybaby, I'll admit it), partially because I feel he lied to me repeatedly for weeks and primarily because I feel like he is sabotaging his mental health. He sees it as his right to not take them if he doesn't want to and that I am the asshole for being so upset over a decision he feels is his alone to make. I can definitely understand his want for freedom, but I feel like this affects us both. Reddit, AITA?

My cousin ended up having to come over and take care of them and it was awkward because they thought I was going to leave to work but never did.. but then later the day my sister called my boss’s wife  (I work with my neigbor and basically my neighbors wife is friends with my sisters)and asked if I had work and she said I did not l.

1336,dmuqix,"WIBTA if I told an irritating person that his crush hates him to the core? Names changed as the persons mentioned here browse reddit.

I (17F) met Alex (17-ish M) only this year, and he's already unbearable. We go to the biggest coaching institute in our town together, and he creates the most disturbance amidst class there, though he has repeatedly tried to convince me the otherwise. All of my fellow female friends there, and many male friends hate him like me, though the person who hates him as much as I do is Annie (17F). Plot twist? He has an obvious crush on Annie. The boy and I share all the tuitions, and whenever he sits next to me, he *has* to include Annie in the conversation. He was upset once when I hinted to him that Annie thinks he is irritating. He refused to believe me when I said that in a test I had supplied her most of the answers and she still got more than me, insisting that she **must** have solved them on her own - even boasting that he had checked her paper himself (papers were distributed at random for checking) and had given her a few extra marks. And he's always going Annie, Annie, Annie. Annie as of now doesn't know this.

Reasons for hating him? His blatant sexism and high thinking of himself. He's a ""gamer"", and a Call-of-duty ""expert"". He told me that girls, like me, a GOT fan, won't be able to stomach Call of duty, and that's why I haven't played it, even though I told him millions of times my PC is too outdated to play it. When any boy mentions a game, he listens eagerly, but when I asked if he had played Dark Souls, he proudly said ""I don't play wimpy games like that."" When I said that I watch cricket but not enough to name a favorite cricketer, and read cricket reports on the paper, he assumed that ""like any girl"", I had only heard the name of cricket and proceeded to ask me if I knew cricket was played on a field and if I knew Sachin Tendulkar existed. He is apparently a cricketer-cum-footballer-cum-kabaddi-cum-badminton player, *he* always saves the day. He proudly says that he watches ""adult movies"" like Jumanji 2, said since I like ""Forrest Gump"", it must be a wimpy movie and claims that he is not scared of me *only because* I am a girl, even though once I had almost come to blows with him. He wouldn't believe girls could be dirty-minded and know bad language until I swore at him. Still believes Annie is an innocent girl somehow.

My friends are urging me to tell how much Annie hates him just to make him shut up temporarily, and personally (I may be biased), I think it will be better as he then wouldn't make any advance towards her, her hatred + his mindset would only be harmful. But somehow, I think it would be too harsh on him, after all, he is just an immature learning teenage boy and sometimes I feel pity for his mindset and what led him to this. WIBTA if I told him about Annie's hatred for him?

Edit: Because of you guys, first thing on my to-do list is to talk to Annie first thing in school on Monday about this. Thanks!"
1337,6utnp2,"AITA for calling my best friend out on blowing me off while I'm home on leave? So I went home for a very short period of time after being gone over a year for. Only a very small handful of people knew I was coming as my very short time was dedicated almost strictly to family and family only. I told my best friend of over 5 years over a month prior to mark these dates. She also is holding onto something of mine she's had for 2+ years that I was trying to get back. I knew she was having financial troubles so I told her she should spend a night at my parents' with me, so we could get some time to just bullshit about life and throw back some drinks. I'd drive to pick her up, drive to drop her off(one way is almost an hour). She agrees.

About a week later I bring it up again, and she says she shouldn't spend a night because her mom already takes care of stuff for her a couple nights a week, she shouldn't throw another day on top of her. I reluctantly say I understand (because she had agreed prior) and we can work it out. 

So the time comes I'm home, it was the day I had originally wanted her to spend the night with me and I want to take a trip to say hello to her mom. She tells me that she's not certain her mom is going to be home either, as she herself won't be home because she's out doing other things and spending the night elsewhere. I pump the brakes and get irritated immediately. I fully admit that my fuse was short here, but this was the text I sent her: ""well you knew the nights I was going to be here, said you couldn't spend the night with me, yet you're going to spend the night in (place)? And I'm still not going to get my (item) back? Awesome."" 

She responded that she forgot it was tonight, that I can still get my item back, and ""today's not your last day here, is it?"" I told her that she was missing my point. That my point was I gave her my dates, she told me she couldn't spend a night with me, but that she could spend that same night elsewhere. When she responded she explained how she was going to be closer to home, (it's almost an hour between our places), she was sorry she forgot, and ""if I remembered you were gonna be home this weekend, I would have told you we could hang out."" 

This is a friend I've spoken many many times with about the frustrations of coming home on leave, and how everybody expects you to go to them, despite driving/flying x amount of hours and spending x amount of money to get home in the first place. She's had a full understanding of all of this and has seen it firsthand as she has family in the military. She knows she was one of the few people I told I was coming home and didn't make any effort despite me saying I'd spend over 3 hours transportation to pick her up/drop her off. I'm genuinely wondering if I'm the asshole with high expectations.

TL;DR: I tell best friend month in advance I'll be home on leave and she should spend a night with me since time is very limited. She agrees, a week later says she can't, and ends up forgetting I was coming and spending the night somewhere else the night she said she couldn't with me. I got upset with her. AITA?

Edit: thank you for your thoughts. I genuinely have a hard time sometimes figuring out whether my military side of my expectations is coming down too hard on my civilian friends, if that makes sense. I really appreciate it!"
1338,emol4p,"AITA for pressuring my boyfriend to let me meet his friends? My (25F) boyfriend (26M) and I have been arguing about his friends. It’s been a rough week and he barely talks to me. We are together for 11 months now and I don’t know any of his friends. I think they know about my existence, but I can't be sure. When I talk about this he still keeps saying that when he meet his friends there are no girls around and it’s all guys and don’t make sense for me to be there but I know that’s not true, because sometimes he visit a friend’s house that live with his girlfriend, so that excuse doesn’t apply here. When it’s some friend’s birthday, mine or his, he don’t want me to go with him or don’t want to go with me if there is a birthday of one of my friends. I don’t get it, I don’t understand why it’s so difficult to him for us to do things like that as a couple.

At this point I am pressuring him and I am feeling more insecure about his friends than ever. Besides this, there is an ex-girlfriend (6 years) that was part of the group and all of his friends know her and it’s freaking me all out, because they know her but they don't know about me! Is it because of her? Why can’t I meet them? What’s the problem?

Its just his friends, because I know all of his family and we spend so much time together, but with his friends he keeps shutting me!

1339,eodw8x,"AITA for not tipping and complaining about delivery drivers who refuse to come to my door? I feel like an asshole already, but I thought I'd ask some other people just to be sure.

So, I recently got a promotion at work that has me working crazy hours from home after I get home from the office. It pays well and I'm single, so I'm digging it. I haven't had much time to cook though, so I've been ordering delivery a lot. This is our busy season, so I'm only going to be working 80-90hr weeks for the next 2 months or so, then I plan to get back to living like a normal person.

I live in a very small apartment complex with about 12 buildings and 4 apartments per building. The buildings are arranged in a circle, so if you drive around, you'll eventually find the building you're looking for. Here's where my dilemma comes into play. I use a few different delivery apps, and I have written very clear instructions in both my address settings and the extra delivery notes on how to find me. I'm in building 7, apartment 2. It's an incredibly easy building to find, again - my apartment complex is literally just a circle. There are no offshoot streets or alleys or anything. However, 9 times out of 10, the delivery driver goes to the wrong apartment and pounds on the door, then calls me to tell me they're at my door. I get that directions can be tricky, but this is where I start to get frustrated. Every single time this happens they don't believe me and I have to convince them to go outside to check the building number. When they see it's wrong, they tell me to come to them. I always say no, because I'm paying for the food to be delivered to my door, and I'm usually in my jammies. At this point they get irritated with me and sigh before asking directions to my building. I tell them it's just a big circle, and again, they don't believe me. One guy made me stay on the phone with him until he could find his car, drive to my building, and drop off my food.

I used to tip well for delivery on apps, but I'm honestly sick of this. I'm terrible with directions and I found my way here when I first moved in with no problem. None of my friends or any restaurant delivery drivers have ever had a problem with it. I've started not tipping and in extreme cases, like the guy who threatened to leave with my food if I didn't come to him, emailing customer service and telling them what happened.

Believe me, I hate this. I never want to be an asshole to somebody just trying to make a living, but I feel like I'm not getting the service I'm paying a premium for and I'm tired of it. AITA?"
1340,e90gtk,"AITA for Calling My Mom Out for Being Hypocritical? Today PSAT scores came out for my state and I got a 1320, which is an awesome score, but it's a big drop from last year for me. I had been feeling pretty upset about the drop in my score the entire day. When I came home, I told my mom about my score and how upset I was and she gave me this speech about how my score didn't matter to her and doesn't really matter in general until 11th grade. It made me feel a lot better and I continued with the rest of my day feeling pretty happy. My mom's opinion means a lot to me, and always has, so hearing this from her really made me feel better.

A few hours later and she's on the phone with my uncle and he was telling her that my cousin (who's basically a math genius) had perfected the math section and only got 3 wrong in English. I overheard him tell her that he's a failure and 3 wrong is awful. He was telling my mom that my cousin had been celebrating and how angry he was with him. My mom was whole heartedly agreeing with my Uncle. She proceed to talk about how bad my score is, how she's disappointed in me, that I'm never going to get into any college, and that I'm a failure.

I just found that SO hypocritical that she just gave me this speech about how my score didn't matter until 11th grade and that she's proud of me for trying my best and then proceed to completely trash me.

When she was done talking to him, I told her, ""I was kind of hurt about what you said to Uncle. You had just told me that it was ok I didn't do that well and then I heard you tell him that you were disappointed. It really hurt my feelings."" Somewhere along those lines, I started to cry. I told her that she should have stood up for my cousin.

Fun fact about my mom: crying makes her VERY angry. The hulk can't compare to her when she's angry.

When she started to see me cry, she cut me off and starting to yell at me about how I should mind my own business and that I shouldn't have been listening to her conversation (which I guess is true) and that I was trying to control her. She said that I was being too sensitive and that she regrets having me and that I'm a massive cry baby. She also said that she only wanted what's best for me, so I should't take things so personally. I tried to explain to her that I wasn't trying to control her and that I was crying because it hurt hearing this from her.

She has refused to hear me out and has taken my phone (fingers crossed this one doesn't get smashed to pieces).

She's super upset with me now and I'm feeling incredibly stressed, guilty, and sad. I know that I shouldn't have talked to her the way I did, but I just couldn't help it.  I feel bad about how I reacted, but don't know if I'm the asshole for what I said."

My fiance and I have been together for almost 4 years and engaged for just over a year.  We decided to have a little longer engagement so we could have a nicer wedding in August 2020.  I've got my dress, we have booked our venue, and settled on a lot of the small details.

Now in the past month my sister has decided that she wants to have her wedding June of 2020.  She already lives with her fiance and they have a child together so I really don't see the rush of planning the wedding in under 6 months anyways, plus only he works so I don't know where they think the money will come from.  I have expressed how I feel about her planning it so close to my wedding and I seem to fall upon deaf ears all the time.

She was talking in the group chat we have with the wedding part about wedding dresses and showing pictures of the one she wanted and it had a very similar open back with lace detail that mine has (I've had it since August 2018).  I asked her again to maybe reconsider one of the many other options she has because it is the main reason i purchased and loved my dress and i just don't want hers being the same especially since we will be having many of the same guests at both weddings. I also went through the same problem with center pieces with her picking ones that are almost the same as mine.

I don't really know how to feel/ react half the time to things she says and wants to do and my parents don't seem to find any of this a problem either.. but I just can't get over it.

I'm not. I have my own reasons why I dont believe as they do, but they wont leave me alone about it. I dont bring up religion or political views on purpose because I know my views are very different from theirs. However my dad constantly tries to convert me. Just earlier he came in with a sheet of paper and told me he signed me up for a few Christian events for people my age. I told him I wont go because I dont believe in it, and he finally sits down and asks me why. Before I can get through my first point he interrupts me and tells me I need to get off the internet because none of the things I am talking about are in the bible.

After he left for the store I took out my grandmother's bible (the only meaning it has for me is she wrote in it. Seeing her handwriting is very comforting to me and it's the only thing of hers I have. The only words that matter to me in it are hers) and bookmarked the verses I was taling about. I picked out maybe four, all neg6and hateful verses that I strongly disagree with and are part of the main reason I reject Christianity as a whole.

What I want to know is WIBTA if I left the bible with its bookmarks on the dinner table where he can find it and see for himself that I'm not just pulling random things from the internet? I just want him and his wife to leave me alone and stop trying to shove their views down my throat.

I would leave the bible out with the bookmarks and a note saying ""Read the verses I bookmarked, because I did. I understand this is your faith, but please understand it isnt mine.""

I'm going to put this here because it seems like every other person commenting thinks I am trying to convert my dad and stepmom.

A few days ago my girlfriend forced me to finish inside her when she's not on birth control and I didn't want to. After I realised how fucked up it was I got pretty uncomfortable with the whole situation. It wasn't malicious from her - she was tipsy and it was a lack of judgement because it hasn't happened in so long so I wasn't angry, but I was/am definitely uncomfortable. Considering she's also a big advocate against abuse and that sort of stuff, it was very hypocritical and I'm still not quite over it.

I've been making a few joking comments about how she r-ped me, or about how if she gets pregnant it will be a baby born of r-pe. They're said in a lighthearted way (I know that the subject is fucked up) so it's clear that it's a joke and I'm not angry about the situation.

1346,aw6qj9,"AITA For telling my wife and son, to leave me out of buying his next car?   

First some background, I am a Disabled Vet with PTSD that manifests as anger, that is how I came by my handle. 

My son who is in his young 20s, had his 1st car accident last week.  Ever since the accident, my wife and son have been taking the word of the insurance people over me. Case in point, I told them to request a mobile adjuster to come to the house, so we have positive control of the vehicle until we sign it over to them, did they listen, no it is sitting in the lot of a local body shop.  We got word that they totaled the truck last night, now my son and Wife want to me go to the body shop (because my son works during their business hours) and pull all the Stereo Equipment that my son and I installed for Christmas. When I asked my son if he remembers what all tools, we needed to get the stuff out, he said no. When I said, that if the truck was still here, he could do it when he got off work, and I would not have to drag half my installers tool box with me and work in the cold, I was called an Ass.

The final straw, was when we were going over vehicles for sale, and came across an ad for a 2013 New Beetle. He said we should sue them for false advertising. When I asked why, he said because the 2019 model is the new beetle. I told him that it was VW that calls that body style the new beetle, to which he wanted to argue with me. When I spun my laptop around to show him where Wikipedia shows every beetle made since 1998 was classified as a new beetle, I was called an ass and he walked away. 

After I calmed down, I decided that maybe, since they where not listening to me, I would just remove my self from the situation. Besides, they have asked my dad (who knows several people in the used car business) to help, this would be another stressor (not bad one, but one none the less), so I know they are in good hands. When I told my wife this, this morning, she said I needed to get a grip, that my son is going through something and I was just being an ass because I was not getting my way.

So Reddit, I know I can be an ass but, am I an Ass(hole) for wanting to remove myself from a situation that I see is full of PTSD triggers?"
1347,cmmbse,"AITA for refusing to let my roommate vent to me? I have two roommates who just started sharing a room; let's call them Alice and Bob. For the past week or two, Alice has been coming to me to vent about her problems with Bob. Mostly she talks about clutter (bed unmade, clothes on the hallway floor outside Bob's closet, etc.), but they also seem to have major problems getting along personality-wise.

The first time she came to me, I listened and was sympathetic. But she kept coming, and it became clear that she doesn't want sympathy or advice, she just wants to vent her anger (which to be fair she seems to have a lot of), often using the same phrases over and over again with increasing vitriol and disgust for a good 45 mins or so each time.

It leaves me feeling really, really drained to listen to her, even if I'm completely silent. I just feel sucked dry and generally awful for hours afterward. It might be affecting me more because of personal idiosyncrasies, but I still can't keep doing it.

Tonight she knocked on my door and started up. I'm going to try to write what happened out as a dialogue.

Alice: "" ... clothes on the floor. How do you live with this? *\[rushing on without letting me answer\]* You know what it is? It's a lack of BASIC consideration, basic consideration. How can someone just -- ""

Me: ""Please, I'm sorry, I'm not okay with being vented at like this.""

Alice: ""I told you, I'm not angry at YOU, you're good, you're -- ""

Me: ""I know, but I'm sorry, I just don't have the energy to handle this.""

Alice: ""How is it that you don't want me to vent to you if I'm not complaining about you???""

Me: ""It's just a lot of negativity and you're saying all these bad things about Bob. I can see them for myself, but all this negativity coming at me -- I don't mind if you do it once, but -- ""

*\[Repeat the above lines once or twice with minor variations and increasing vehemence.\]*

Alice: ""*\[going back to her rant\]* But it's just like every time I go in the room I see her things all on the floor! How hard is it for her to -- ""

Me: ""*\[upset and knowing she won't pause for breath for a long time\]* DID YOU NOT HEAR WHAT I JUST SAID?!""

Alice: ""Okay but there's just no one else here to vent to. There's no one else in the apartment. It's too late to call \[hometown in another time zone\]. I just need to let it out.""

Me: ""Then I'm sorry, but you can write it down or make a voice note. I can't handle this right now.""

I had to use a contractor from a specific list, as a home warranty I have requires it. The contractor I decided to use was an older gentleman, that appeared to be a hard worker and genuinely concerned with taking care of his customer. He even added refrigerant to my existing unit so our house could be cool while we waited for installation. 

My wife didn’t get a great vibe from him off the bat, but I told her that he seems like a great guy. Installation date was set for this past Wednesday. On Tue. night I hadn’t heard from him so I called to see when he would arrive on Wed. He asked me if we could reschedule to install on Thurs. as he was so tired from a previous job he had just completed. I agreed, and he said he would drop off all the materials Wed. afternoon. 

He did not drop off the materials and I hadn’t heard from him at all Thurs. morning. I called him him around 9 am. He asked asked if I could do him a “favor.” “Can I drop the materials off Thursday and install the unit on Saturday?” He said he was just so busy. Frustrated, I agreed again to that plan. He randomly showed up at my house on Thurs. with everything to drop off. I was at work and my wife was running errands. I gave him my garage code so he could get the materials inside, at this point I want to do anything to move this along. 

30 min later my wife pulls into our subdivision and sees him passed with his head hanging out of his drivers side window of his creeper van. My wife at this point wants nothing to do with him. I decided on Friday I would reach out to him. I told myself if he tried to reschedule I would pull the plug on this entire job. I texted him at noon and received no response. I called him at 2:30 and left a voicemail. At 5:30 I called again and left another voicemail. By 9:30 pm I still had not heard from him. This was our 5 year anniversary and my wife and I were sitting in the hot ass house. I sent him a blistering text message telling him how unprofessional he was and how much of my time he had wasted, admittedly I was aggressive, and slightly vulgar. 

Sat at 11:00am he finally responds and asks me if he can come over and start work? I said no way. He “guaranteed” completion on that day. After a lot of back and forth I tell him to come get his shit and don’t come back. Now he was trying to tell me MY pick up schedule didn’t work for him. 

In the end he comes and picks up all his shit from my garage and leaves me this note: 

“Just want you to know, that I work hard everyday to support my family. Just one more thought. Before you judge a person no matter how it appears, take a moment before rushing to judgment. Maybe there is a physical reason out of their control. Sleep issues or just working long hours”

Since the baby has been born, I’ve been getting more upset about this. It’s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. 

Fast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he’s done and doesn’t understand why I’m upset. 

I told him at this point I’m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other person obviously doesn’t care that his actions upset me. 

He thinks I’m picking a fight. I’m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that’s fine but other than that it’s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn’t care, or doesn’t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? 

So?  Am I the asshole? 


Edit: just a couple words misspelled. 

Edit 2: I just want to add this in... when is DOES spend time with her, he’s an excellent father. He loves her a lot and he cares about her very much. I don’t want anyone to get the wrong impression there.  But the key word there is ‘when’ because it’s only ever ‘when’ it suits him... Ie he’s not in the mood for a nap, or a game, or scrolling his phone etc 

Edit 3: his solution to all this was to smash his PlayStation. Obviously dramatic, but whatever works. I told him I don’t want him to stop playing, I just want him to learn when the appropriate times are, like after baby is in bed.  Or, even, if he said “hey I’m kind of feeling up for a game, you good for an hour or two?”  That would work, too. Instead he chose to smash his PlayStation, so to each their own.  He is now crying saying “this sucks it’s the only thing I like to do”.  I’m trying to be sympathetic but honestly we have a four month old and two dogs (border collies, very high energy), so there are a ton of things he can do instead of playing his games. 

Edit 4: apparently he didn’t smash his PlayStation... he just put it away and the loud smashing sounds I heard was him accidentally knocking over a shelf on the bookshelf as he stormed over to his PlayStation. He said he was storming over to it to smash it but changed his mind because it’s an expensive piece of equipment. 

So I proposed counselling with him. I said for both of us, for me so I can learn how to convey my point better and for him so he can learn how to process what I’m saying. According to him, it’s just that he hears me but it doesn’t click in his brain right away. he thinks it’s the stupidest idea he’s ever heard and is completely unwillingly to even entertain the idea. 

My issue at this point, I’ve realized, is that every time one of his actions is bothering me, I have to tell him so many times that it bothers me to the point that I am crying and yelling and really really upset before it changes.  I asked him why this time he put the PlayStation away but not any of the other million times I asked him to stop with the gaming... he said because it’s what he likes to do and he had a hard time choosing but now he realized that I was serious about how upset I was. After I told him I was at my breaking point. 

I really appreciate him putting away the console. He is making an effort in doing so and it doesn’t go unnoticed but this has all really opened up my eyes to the fact that he doesnt take me seriously unless I have tears streaming down my face from being so upset. So now I ultimately need to decide if I can live like that, having to cry my eyes out before I’m heard, or if I am just going to end it now to save us all the heartache later. "
1351,dipt2j,"AITA for not saying good morning? I recently went on a vacation with my family. For context, I’m in uni (F), my brother is in high school, and my parents are in their early 50s. We are East Asian, and we were part of a tour group of around 40 people, all of whom are white. 

Now, most of the people were pretty nice, but there was one couple who seemed kinda off. They were rather rude on the bus, talking really loudly when everyone was trying to sleep, and blocking the aisles so they could get off first all the time.

Every time my mom would try to greet them or talk to them, they would ignore her, but they had no problem talking to anyone else. 

What really pissed me off was when the guy literally elbowed me in the spine and didn’t apologise. 

One time, my parents went down for breakfast ahead of me and my brother. When we got there, they were sitting next to the couple. My mom kept insisting that we say good morning to them (not in English, so they didn’t understand), but we refused. She got mad and later went on a rant about how our bad character reflects poorly on them as parents, and how greeting people good morning is part of being a decent human being. 

AITA?"
1352,e57u1u,"WIBTA for making a big deal about my little brother's preferential treatment? I have 2 brothers; one older and one younger.  Being the middle child I don't feel like I got the same attention or privileges as my other two siblings -my younger brother in particular.  For instance, he studied abroad in 2 different countries, took every school trip available, and got a car (which he sold and pocketed the money) all on my parents dime while in college.  

All of this incredibly irked me because my other brother and I never got any breaks as soon as we hit college. My parents (rightfully so) made us foot the bill on everything.  At the time of all of his subsidized globe-trotting, I was struggling to make my minimum student loan payments and rent.  I had assumed when my younger brother finished college, the safety net would be taken away and he'd have to start fending for himself. 

Of course this was not the case.  Right after college he decided he was going to live abroad in Thailand and once again my parents paved the way for that.  One year and lots of cash from my parents later, he's tired of Thailand and moves to Australia.  Another year after that he moves to New Zealand.  He has a very low-paying job in all of these countries and uses my parents' wallet to keep this lifestyle up.  Back home, I had gotten laid off after 2yrs with a startup and had to move back in with my parents and also put my loans in forbearance because they refused to help me out money-wise.  

So we get to the present and he has been out of college for 3+ years and has done nothing but traveled and partied around the world the entire time.  I come to find out recently that my dad has been paying his student loans for the past year as well...something I was told they couldn't help me out with when I was really hurting.  On top of that my little brother now plans to quit his job, buy a van, and tour the country for the remaining 4 months he has in New Zealand.  I know full well he will find a way to get my parents to once again fund this. 

I realize it's petty, but I'm livid at this point.  I've been able to hold my tongue on all of the disparities in the past but I'm so close to calling my mom and dad up to tell them they're being ridiculous.  My brother is a 25yr old who has had everything given to him for nearly a decade now and I'm sick of both him taking advantage of my parents and their inability to tell him no.  I know it wouldn't benefit me at all, but I want to tell them to cut him off financially.  Would I be an ass for doing this?  Or should I just forget about it like all the other instances and just live my life?

Update: Thanks everyone for your responses, it's honestly making me feel a lot better about the situation. I believe reading those and venting about it a bit really helped. I've decided to let it slide and not bring it up to my family as much as I want to bitch and moan about it. As some of you have mentioned, I am financially stable and I can afford my own plane tickets around the world now, so I should be happy that I'm in my own shoes and not in someone's who can't say the same. Thanks!"
1353,9qubt3,"AITA for not giving my friends free rides? For context I’m a broke high schooler who works under the table jobs whenever I can. I recently just got my own car and have decided that since I have to buy my own gas, I can’t be giving my friends free rides whenever they need them anymore.

Now I used to drive my parents cars around a lot, and every time someone needed a ride from anywhere, school, home, some random ass location, they’d call me and I’d be there. I’d drive them around and then go home, didn’t usually expect anything in return. Eventually it got to the point though where I kinda felt like I was being used, they’d call me just because they were feeling lazy and couldn’t walk literally 3 blocks to get to their house. Still, I tried to be nice and help out when I could.

Come a few months later, I finally bought my own car with $500 I managed to scrape together. I have to buy my own gas now so it costs me out of pocket to drive places.  Because of this, I finally asked my friends to help out with some gas money so that I could keep helping them out. They never did despite me driving them around a few more times anyway. One of them finally caved and gave me pocket change recently, like $6, but I thought that was kinda rude after the year I drove him around for free. So I haven’t been giving any rides since, and I’ve decided I won’t until someone helps me out a bit in return.

My only problem is, I feel like I’m not being a good friend anymore. I feel greedy. I try to justify it to myself because I don’t have an official job and make about $100 average every 2 weeks, and I got some other expenses, but I still feel like a bad person now. Am I the asshole here reddit?"
1354,c6ko6a,"AITA for making my stepfather starve throughout a day because I save my own money in case of emergency? Just a quick heads up, the relationship that I currently have with my stepfather is great, although we've met ourselves with some difficult situation sometimes. This is simply one of them and I am interested to hear some of your thoughts about it. 

Small background: My stepfather is some kind of preacher and also a businessman who goes on various cities on a daily basis. I managed to meet him every week or so and we spent time together talking about various things, usually about my future. It's safe to say that I need him and that feeling's mutual.  
I woke up in the morning and prepared myself to attend my lectures. My stepfather then messaged me to lend him about 35$ so he can go out and do something that he didn't specify. I had full intention of giving him that much until I checked my actual saving. It was no more than 60$ (It was the end of the month). Earlier this month, I already lent him 100$ for his necessities but, he spent all of that money and his own so quickly. Apparently, it was for the salaries of his workers, his medication, and for his own transportation fee.

So that 35$ request was not so surprising, but still, I have necessities on my own. My (nondegree) course fees might be coming, so I couldn't spend my saving mindlessly. So I told him to wait till next month for me to lend him more money. He hasn't specified his need for that 35$ so I assumed that it was nothing urgent. Then he said to me that it's ok and he would stay at his home instead of going to work for the day. 

He told me later that day that he went outside the city to attend some lectures, with almost nothing in his pocket. He ended up not eating for the whole day, except for some snacks in that event. He then teased me about that 35$ request and how it would've been really helpful for him. I asked him back about why he didn't tell me that he would go to work and the urgency of that request, but he went silent. I felt bad but also annoyed at the same time.

TL: DR AITA for not lending my stepfather 35$ for necessities that he didn't specify earlier and then ended up starving himself for a day because I keep my own remaining savings for emergency?"
1355,7akmcj,"AITA for wanting to complain about a screaming child? So I moved into my very large apartment complex a few months ago, and I am fully aware of and fine with the typical noise issues expected in such a building. Overall it's minimal, such as the dog above us scampering around and frequently dropping something hard (assuming a bone) on the hardwood floor. It's annoying, but fine. 

The issue I have is with a family that has what seems to be a very difficult toddler/ young child. She is constantly screaming. I can't imagine what the family must be dealing with, and I don't know if she has some sort of condition, but it is constant. Now, she isn't my next door neighbor, and actually lives down the hall. Not only is she loud enough to hear down the hall when their door is shut, but her parents let her ""let off steam"" by running and playing in the hallway multiple times a day. Yesterday afternoon (I work from home) her mother was playing catch with her outside my door. Last night, her father was with her and was pushing her on one of those bikes with a long handle, encouraging her when she was shrieking and laughing. 

Now I applaud them for playing with their daughter, but our hallway echos, A LOT, and while the walls are thick, noise travels through our doors very easily. You could probably play the bagpipes next door to me and I wouldn't hear it, but if you clear your throat in front of my door I would. It sounded like she was in my apartment shrieking. 

Am I the asshole for being sick of this, and thinking it is incredibly rude of this family to not take her outside to play and instead lets her use the hallway as a playground? Am I the asshole for thinking this child, who appears to be around 3 or 4 should know what an inside voice is? It was in the 70s yesterday and there is a playground around the corner, if they can spend 40 minutes in the hallway, they can take the time to go to a real playground. 

Is it an asshole move to ask them to stop next time or complain to the building management about this issue? I have a few recordings of the noise (not of the child, just of the sound) in case I need proof of the disturbance. 

Obviously both parties have the right to enjoy the space they pay for in reasonable comfort. Technically my building does have quiet hours which would excuse the issue I have during the day (frustrating for work, but fine), but I still think there has to be some reasonable difference between being in your private residence and the public shared space. 

TLDR: AITA for thinking an apartment hallway is not an acceptable playground for a difficult and very vocal child and that I (and other people on my floor) are entitled to living in peace?"
1356,cxzyln,"WIBTA if I yelled at my dad for his carelessness with our cats/disregard for their safety? EDIT: added tl;dr at the bottom, also I worry this seems like a ""validation post"" but I'm genuinely not sure if my anger is warranted, since he's not actually deliberately doing any harm. 

Title makes it sound worse than it probably is but here goes: I'm 21 and live at home (while at uni nearby) with my parents and 2 cats (~8 years old, twins). Both my parents are big drinkers, but my dad tends to be more irresponsible when he's drunk. Also, slightly relevant: I'm autistic and the idea of danger to animals, particularly cats, really upsets me. Both parents know this. 

Lately my dad has, when drunk, been a bit of a dick towards our cats. It started off with ""jokes"" about them coming to harm, which is in bad taste but overall harmless as he was never actually violent. Just fairly upsetting to me. Lately though, he's been really careless with how he handles the cats, in particular he picked up one of them (Oscar) with one hand under the front legs and another around his neck (like, gripping him round the neck, not carrying him by the scruff like a kitten), so I had to run over to him and grab the cat and tell him off. Every time I get upset though he and my mum just sort of laugh it off as One Of Those Things. I'm a young autistic woman and thus how I feel about people not respecting my pets' safety clearly doesn't matter, right?

This evening in particular, I was taking a nap and our other cat Ollie had caught a mouse, so dad woke me up asked me where the Nerf gun was (bought it as a gift for a younger cousin years ago, his parents said no so it's sat in a spare room, packaged and unused since then) as he wanted to use it to scare the cat. I got upset and told him off, and he insisted that he wasn't going to shoot *at* the cat, just near him to make him drop the mouse. I still said I didn't want him doing it so he said okay and I went back to sleep. I've just woken up and come downstairs to see the Nerf gun sitting in the kitchen, and I'm just sort of quietly seething. Because sure, he might not have shot at the cat, and the Nerf gun itself might be physically harmless, but I really can't trust that he didn't try to cause him harm (or at least didn't care that he might). At the very least, there are better ways of dealing with a cat who caught a mouse than scaring him with a projectile weapon. 

So, Reddit, WIBTA if I gave my dad a proper piece of my mind about his overall behaviour towards the cats/lack or respect for their safety? I'm not normally capable of much in the way of anger, nor do I believe in it, but reasoned discussion along the veins of ""please stop being horrible to the animals in your care"" hasn't worked so far. 

(Also, I know there are mixed opinions on whether cats should even be allowed outside. I personally stand on the ""if you live somewhere you can *guarantee* their safety then go for it"" side. We don't. But again, my opinion on their well-being doesn't seem to matter, also they were rescue cats so were already accustomed to life outdoors.)

TL;DR my dad is pretty careless with my cats and doesn't respect their safety, I feel like getting mad at him is the wrong choice but also seems to be the only solution."
1357,bo5u0z,"WIBTA for telling my STBX I don't want to accept the Mother's Day gift he got me? My STBXH gave me a Mother's Day gift yesterday... it was supposed to be from our daughter, to me, but she's in preschool, and obviously needs some help.  I was thinking he'd help her pick out something small.  Maybe a bath soap and lotion set or chocolates, nothing outside of the $25-$35 range.

Instead, he got me an annual pass to a popular local theme park (over $500).  In the card, he wrote that it was so I could take our daughter to said theme park.  However, he did not pay for her annual pass.  He expects us to ""split"" her pass.  WIBTA for telling him his gift is inappropriate?  Yes, he spent several hundred dollars on me (and I neither expected nor wanted that much spent on me), but on a gift that forces ME to spend several hundred more dollars before I can use it as intended.  And that money is before we factor in $25 parking for every visit, plus ridiculously overpriced concessions.

1358,asfd12,"AITA for cutting my friend with poor mental health out of my life? I've been friends with Tim for 20 years. We grew up together and have always been best friends. We went to different colleges and during that time he was diagnosed with depression and bipolar. I stuck with him, helped as much as possible. During this time he would have meltdowns and run away from campus, destroy his room, cut himself. It was a dark time and heartbreaking for me and his family. He eventually found medication and therapy that works for him which is great and he's been stable for about three years. 


These days, he rarely speaks to me, and when he does he has a rude comment to say or some condescending opinion about my life.however he always talks about me calling me his BEST friend. We had plans last week, at a set date and time and when I called to confirm he just said ""I'm spending tomorrow with my girlfriend sorry"". He belittles my own relationship and makes fun of my job even though his is very similar. 


This is all stuff that has annoyed me in the past, but the last straw was yesterday. He has a small YouTube channel and and he posted a video going into great detail about his suicide attempts over the years. In the video he talks about it in a very upbeat tone with happy music in the background. It was honestly very disturbing. I had no idea he had ever attempted this. I've recently lost someone very close to me to a suicide and he knows this. He knows I watch his videos as I always talk to him about them and comment on them. 


I understand using a video as a way to vent out your ideas and experiences and he isn't obligated to share anything with me. But he didn't warn me of the content in the video in any way, knowing I had just lost a family member to suicide and the wound is still very fresh for me. Continuing to be his friend is now effecting my own mental health, as I went into a panic half way through the video and couldn't continue watching.


Whenever I tell someone of the rude things he says or does they say he probably doesn't realize what he's saying is hurtful but I don't believe that. Especially because he is capable of treating his girlfriend perfectly fine. I genuinely believe he may have become more socially awkward as his issues developed, but I also believe he uses his disorders as a crutch to say and do what he wants with out consequence. 


I don't want to be friends with someone that doesn't take me and my feelings into consideration. I realize this may make me an asshole but I just can't do it anymore.


Tl;Dr 

My friend who is bipolar and has depression is rude to me and does things without taking my feelings and experiences into consideration. It's taking a toll on me and I want to cut him out of my life. "
1359,dmkdp4,"AITA for telling my GF I've stopped caring about her insecurities? I already feel like a bit of an asshole but I'm not sure what else to do so I wanted reddits opinion.

A little backstory, my GF (28) and myself (34m) have been together for nearly 10 years now. Our relationship has been pretty solid up till the last few years where this problem started and has grown to being a nearly daily occurrence which is driving me mad. We met when I was just finishing university and she was just starting, we hit it off instantly and got serious pretty fast. It was a little weird as she was just starting full time studying and I was entering the workforce but we were really happy together. Fast forward to now and we own a home together and were talking about marriage/children until recently.

When we first met I was at my heaviest (300lb+) as full time studying and bad eating habits had caught up with me, she has pretty much stayed consistent with her weight since we met. A few years ago I decided I wanted to get back into the shape I used to be in, since then I've been pretty consistent with eating/working out and have dropped about 140lbs. this is something we've been doing together and she seemed pretty happy that we were both eating healthy. When I first started losing weight she used to occasionally joke about I would fine someone better looking than her but this has now grown to be part of most conversations we have.

At first I would just joke back that after being with her for so long it would be too much effort to find someone else to put up with me but as it became more constant I stopped doing that. I tried to reassure her how I wasn't interested in anyone else, how I loved her and that she was beautiful but it doesn't seem to make any difference. She will just bluntly state in both private and a public setting how she looks ugly compared to me and that everyone must wonder why I'm still with her and she wouldn't be surprised if I was cheating on her.

At this point I wasn't comfortable anymore with her openly saying that I was the type of person to cheat on her so we sat down and had a serious conversation about what I could do to change how she feels and if there was anything that I was doing to cause this. She said that it was nothing that I had done and this is just how she feels, I suggested that she could go talk to a therapist to work through her issues or we could go together to work on this but she declined that as well.

Last week was was my final straw when I got home from work late and the first thing she said to me was ""Oh so you'd rather spend time with your attractive coworker than come home to my ugly ass"" and I just snapped and replied ""I honestly don't care about how you feel anymore, this has been going on for over a year and you refuse to tell me what I can do any differently or help you work on this. If you don't do something I will actually leave"". She stormed off crying and hasn't spoken to me since Monday. I feel like an asshole for how I replied but I’m just so tired of it."
1360,er3q9v,"AITA for saying I would never join a frat My friend who I’ve known since sophomore year of high school has been in a fraternity since our fist semester of college (we are sophomores now) and yesterday he tried to get me to “pledge” and join his frat. I politely declined and just said I’m too busy. 

He called me out and asked for the real reason, so I told him. I think frats are bad. They promote binge drinking, drug use, and other unhealthy behaviors that I’m not interested in. I made sure to say I know he’s responsible and that I have nothing against frats or sororities, but I would never join one. He took offense and left my apartment after. Today he texted me saying that it was rude for me to insult his “brothers” like that.

1361,cjfywz,"WIBTA if I started blatantly recording my creepy neighbor when he stares at me? My Fiance' and I bought our house 3 years ago. I'm a paramedic and actually had visited my now-neighbor quite a few times in a professional capacity (that's as specific as I can be). We got along swimmingly and he came across quite nice, although a bit strange. I was warned by my other neighbors to be careful around him, as he can be quite hostile at times. He once called bylaw and forced the old homeowners to pay for snow removal because they shoveled their snow onto his half of the yard. Petty stuff like that. The first ~year went by fine, then the complains started coming in.



- We're too loud (we never have people over past 11). 

- We keep littering cigarette butts into his yard (neither of us or any of our friends smoke).


- Snow fell from my roof and hit his fence, so we better replace the damaged board (it had a small chip, but we replaced it anyways).




- I was being inconsiderate and rude by not checking on them, as they're both elderly and unwell. Apparently because I'm a paramedic I'm the guardian of the neighborhood?







Up until this point we were annoyed but absolutely civil - would always smile and wave, etc. Then about a year ago we had our roof replaced. The roofer texted me around 8pm one night saying he had a cancel and can squeeze us in tomorrow - he agreed and because of this we forgot to give the neighbors notice (not an excuse, entirely my fault). I was at work and I got a call from my fiance' crying. Neighbor stormed over, pounded on the door, barged into the house and started screaming at her. I can't remember the exact details anymore, but he called my mom a bitch (because she was over to pick up my dog and wouldn't entertain his antics), said we're terrible people, screamed about how he's hiring a lawyer because the roofers stepped on one of his plants (would have been happy to replace it if he asked nicely), and even attempted to grab my fiance' after she told him to get out and closed the door in his face.  Called the cops, they didn't really do much.




Fast forward a year and here we are. We haven't spoken to them since then. We both do our best to ignore them, however the one neighbor **blatantly** stares at us. Out front? Standing in his door staring. Shoveling the driveway? Watches us the whole time. My friends and family have picked up on it too - he does it whenever anyone comes over. Just last weekend we had ~8 people in our backyard around 9pm for a late-night BBQ. The creep stood on his deck and kept intermittently poking his head over to stare at us. 




I don't know what to do. I don't want to go nuclear because of my job and the fact that I may have to deal with him down the road. WIBTA if I were to blatantly take out my phone and point it at home, as if I were recording him whenever he starts staring at me? What else can I do? He's technically not breaking any laws."

My wife (23F) and I (25M) were out shopping and decided to take my daughter (2F) over to a nearby frozen yogurt shop. Pretty standard place; grab  your cup in the back, fill up the yogurt, toppings, then pay. However, when we got to the counter the employee (probably about 17\~19F) that was previously talking to who I could assume would be a friend/SO on the phone was no where to be seen.

After waiting for about a minute or two I leaned over the counter a bit and saw them in the back texting or something, I decided to to say ""Hey, is it possible for us to checkout here real quick? We're in a bit of a hurry."" The girl glanced up at me and said to give her a minute. After about five more minutes I decided we'd just leave the yogurt on the counter and got my daughter some ice cream from the Target next door.

1364,e8bc2i,"AITA for screaming really loud when drivers come close to hitting me on my bike? I've started biking to my job, to the gym, to pretty much everywhere to get in shape. 

It's been mostly great, I've lost a bunch of weight and gotten a lot stronger too. 

But the one stressful thing is how drivers around here aren't great... Lots of dumb driving, speeding, road rage, texting, etc... And I've had a couple close calls.

Just a month ago for example, I was driving on a 2 lane road, in the right lane. People in the right lane are allowed to turn right or go straight. People in the left lane are allowed to turn left or go straight.

Well, a guy in a SUV took a right turn from the left lane, and nearly hit me from the side. And that's just one example of dumb driving.

I always try to avoid those situations from the start, and evade them if I see them happening. But sometimes something takes me by surprise.

I can't really honk because I'm on a bike, and nobody in a car is going to hear a bike Bell. I also don't want to scream angrily because I'm afraid someone might react bad to that and hurt me. 

So if a close call happens, I just scream as loud and high as I can. No words, just AAAAAA. Like ""girl getting murdered in a horror movie"" like banshee style shriek. 

I've got a real high voice and great projection. I was a soprano in my school's choir and I can belt it. And every time I've done that, whoever was driving slams the breaks or slows way down to look around. 

I never thought there was much trouble with that; I gotta do something to keep myself safe. But then yesterday I was going to work and someone in a pickup truck ran a stop sign and had a close call with me. So I swerved and shrieked, and kept shrieking till the driver had fully stopped. He seemed spooked. 

Then I saw some of my coworkers on the sidewalk, they were going to get coffee together, and they waved me over and asked if I was OK, what had just happened.

I was like ""yeah I'm good, just didn't wanna get run over and needed that truck to see or hear me"" and they were like ""girl everyone in a half mile radius heard you""

I was kinda joking around and went ""Thank the finest vocal training at (my hometown) Junior high"" 

And a couple of my coworkers said it wasn't that funny, I'd given them a scare and probably everyone else in earshot too.

AITA for screaming when I have close calls on my bike? It's more to draw drivers attention than out of genuine horror or pain."
1365,bxm3pt,"AITA for wanting to play an online game with my friend? In terms of the game, all you have to know is it has a ranking system, teamwork and is strategy based.


This happened very recently, and I decided to make this post because I think there's a good chance I am not seeing straight and I need another persons perspective.

Long time ago my friend invited me to play a game with me, I joined and he made a discord server in the hopes we could both go professional one day.

Eventually he realised I couldn't keep up and the team idea was scrapped. The server was repurposed, I made a bot for the server and we had a pretty good time still.

The trouble starts now, I had moved and my aussie internet is complete garbage here. I can only really play the game when noone else is on the internet (limiting when I can play) as well as I lose 10% of games from it anyway.

I was already bad before but I actually went down a rank around this same time. I would still ask my friend if he wanted a game and even though he could say no (and I told him that). Repeatedly we would play together and lose since I could not fight such high ranking players. Losing clearly annoyed him, and others have pointed out how he gets annoyed by it to easily.

From his perspective I am deliberately trying to lose, I am actually trying my best but he's just so much better than me. It doesn't help that I sometimes pick the more fun strategies over the most efficient. I will always argue its a game and I want to have fun, but he will argue isn't winning fun?

During these matches he will sometimes mute his mic and clearly get mad. End the game complaining about what I did wrong and play solo.

This brings us to the recent event, where on a game both of us picked a fun strategy over a more efficient one. After the game he uses his privileges on the server to make it so I can't hear him. Talks shit about me. (I have external confirmation of what he said)

I bring this up with him, denies it then he blames me for not doing a role I was trying my best to do and gets up me for the fun strategy. Says he should have listened to a friend who says don't play with people who deliberately try to lose.

AITA for not realising he just wants to win and go professional? AITA for wanting to play with him? What should I do to mend this relationship?"
1366,cm5a4g,"AITA for sitting with a different ""team"" after mine kept ditching me? Pretty much all in the title. And sorry for any formatting, I'm on my phone.

I've been at a competition for the last 5 days. We compete individually but each region has a ""team"". Starting the very first night they left to see if they wanted to do duo's and be back. Ok, cool, sure go do your thing. Another team invited me to hangout with them, so I did and had a blast. They never came back

The next day I'm sitting with my team and taking videos of our team's performances, since our director asked if we could. And then it just sort of became a repeat of ""I'm just quickly going to so this, be back in a minute"" and then I'm alone for an hour. It really hurt because I thought of one of them as my friend and we've known each other for a couple of years now. So I got fed up and hung out with the other team again, they invited me to party with them after and had a great time again. By then the other team had already ""adopted"" me and said I was part of their team now too.

The 3rd day is just another repeat. I get left alone, other team is more than happy to have me hang out with them but I would go back to my team's table whenever they showed up again. And take videos when needed

So day 4 shows up, I start hanging out with the others while waiting for my team. When they did the other team invited the rest of my team to join them, but they just just went to another table. I joined them for a bit but of course they went off, so I said fuck it, went to my new friends and stayed. I still took the videos they asked me to when it was their turn but other than that I was with the other team.

Throughout the night, the other girl on my team kept giving me looks over her shoulder, while I'm back there having a good time. I just shrugged it off, thinking ""well can you blame me?""

When I look back, while I still stand by my decision, I am wondering AITA for pretty much just leaving them to join the other ""team""?"
1367,bjox7z,"AITA for being annoyed about my gay friend making straight jokes? I have a lot of LGBTQ friends, many of them are really chill and we don’t insult each others preferences (I’m straight).  However, in this group chat, there is this one friend (lets call her A) who says things like “ew hetties” and “lets stone all hets”.  Today one of my bi friends (lets call her B) sent photos of this boy, calling him cute.   I said he looked pretty.  A said “why do straight people have horrible taste” and then said “i’m talking about (my name)”.  I got annoyed and said “heterophobia be like” (which probably wasn’t that cool of me now that I think of it).  Afterwards, A kept saying “hetties be like” and “yes, i, the heterophobe is making a comeback”. I just laughed at the comments and acted like I saw them as jokes, but I was kinda annoyed.  This one girl who is very close friends with A kept hearting her comments and saying “god i’m so happy that A, the heterophobe, has made a comeback”, which B sent a dislike in response.  Idk, AITA here?

EDIT:  I think I need to add some more context.  My friend group doesn’t really know A, she was added into a group chat a week and a half ago without the person who added her asking the entire group first.  Most of us have never met her in person.  I called her a friend because we had a few funny conversations over text, but besides that my friend group and I don’t have much history with her."

So a bit of back story: I've known this girl for a few months and she's honestly perfect, like she's everything i'd ever hope for in a girlfriend. But about a month in to our relationship she was at a house party and got super drunk and super high and cheated on me. She says it wasn't intentional and she was heartbroken when we broke up. So a few weeks go past and we starting talking about it and long story short, we're back together (I know, im a mug).

But she just told me that on Friday she is going to a nightclub with one of her guy friends and a bunch of other people that she doesn't know, and she also plans on getting super fucked up. She had been pretty secretive of who she was going with all week but she only says that's because she thinks i'd go mental if she told me, which I inevitably did.

My sister has been casually dating recently and one day I come home and I see she’s snapchatting him. Since I stopped having anything to do with him and haven’t said 2 words to her in about 5 days.

1370,b24mx9,"AITA for causing my wife to be Baker acted So previous post git removed because of some of the details. So I'm going to omit some of it to make it comply with rules.

So tonight someone that I considered a friend came around for some drinks. After a couple I went to bed because I have work early.

She had previously kissed this friend (whilst drinking, never sober) and I was somewhat paranoid, so I when it went quiet I got paranoid and sneakily poked my head around the corner and it turned out my gut was right and they were kissing. So I confronted them there and then, I told him to fuck off and told her that we wouldn't be hanging out/seeing him again.

She ran outside to 'check that he wasn't driving' because he was drunk. I didn't know but she took a razer...

(hopefully that's vague enough to avoid being deleted, sorry mods if it isn't but it's kind of a important point)

I go to the medicine cabinet to get medical supplies (trained first aider) and she sprints out the door, and manages to lose me around a corner.

At this point I had no idea what to do so I rang the police, who found her 30mins later about half a mile away and decide to Baker act her. I didn't get to see her before they took her away.

I feel like an asshole for doing this and I'm scared she's going to hate me when they release her. "
1371,cyzx5j,"AITA for trying to tell my neighbor she needs to keep an eye on her dog? Forgive my grammar**

I tried to approach my neighbor to talk about boundries between her dog running on my property and I may have just stuck my foot in my mouth

Background: My husband and I bought a house last fall and our neighbors across the street seemed garbage from the start. They took things from the house left behind by the previous owner after we had already bought the property, then denied it and said the previous owner gave them things as they were moving out. Which is for sure a lie but it didn't really matter because we were just happy to be moving into our new home. 

We live in the sticks and it's been made pretty clear that the neighbors are taking our mail and packages so we got a POB in town. I've tried to be friendly nevertheless but they completely ignore me which really wouldn't matter but I have a territorial rescue dog and I feel like I owe it to my neighbor to make them aware so we can both avoid any issues with their dog.

They're hard to get a hold of so I saw them on the porch and approached them, she had her tiny dog and I tried to explain about how one of my dogs is aggressive but she took her pup inside and got angry. I wasnt trying to upset her but I did probably come off aggressive, I've been trying to meet you for months. If I'm going to be living next to these people for years I want to be on good terms and if we can't then we need to have rules. I just wanted to actually face to face with her and let her know I have an aggressive dog and would appreciate if she wouldn't let her doggo run across the rd in my yard anymore. She didn't get it and took offense within 3 seconds of my saying it. 

I just felt horrible for upsetting her and shamed for trying to speak up for my pups because all the men (old woodchucks and young bucks) laughed at me. I'm trying to see it like I understand where she's coming from. I might not like her household but I didn't mean to make her feel unsafe in it.

My uncle, who has been ""dieting"" for many years, has finally lost a bunch of weight. Mind you, it was because he had to get lapband surgery. He proceeds to tell me that I'm not losing weight fast enough and says that I'm not doing enough to lose it. I point out that the only reason he lost weight is because he got the surgery. Now my family thinks I'm being an A-hole for calling him out. AITA?"
1373,dkd1xf,"AITAH for being upset with my sister? My sister is mid 30s and has 2 kids (15 &10) who I'm very close with. I'm early 30s and have a small home right on the water, where everyone is welcome to use the outdoor equipment I have. 

In the last year or so, there's been a change in my sister. She only really calls me when she needs something (usually for the kids, so I don't mind). She borrows things and breaks them, and doesn't even offer to replace them. She comes to my house when I'm not there to go out on the water (again I don't mind), where she leaves my front door wide open and my dog gets out (which I only find out when I get a phone call from a neighbor).

Several weeks ago, her and her boyfriend came to my house (again while I wasn't there), and I immediately knew because my door was, again, left wide open. As I come into my house, I notice my dishes were mysteriously done and someone was also in my bedroom and had clearly rummaged through my nightstand. Now, I generally don't have an issue with her coming into the house to use the bathroom and such. But my bedroom has always been off limits.

I called her to ask her if she was there, where she originally lied about it, then admitted to doing the dishes, then finally admitted to being in my bedroom ""looking for a lighter"". The whole thing didn't make sense. Anyway, I made it clear that I didn't appreciate her being in my bedroom, she gets all mad, pointing out that she did the dishes (which I didn't ask her to do), as if that excuses the invasion of my privacy. So, we get into an argument where she tells me I'm no longer allowed to take my niece to our parents the following weekend.

My niece, the 10 year old, calls me later, in tears, very upset that she can't see her grandparents. She asks if we can go out the next day to cheer her up. I said yes. 

Now, I did try to call my sister that night to let her know our plans, but she didn't answer. So, the next day, I pick up my niece and I text my sister that we're going to lunch, where we'll be, and what time we should be back. A little while later my sister calls me, screaming that I kidnapped her child, don't f* with a mother and her kids, threatens to call the police if she's not home in 10 minutes, etc. I'm so freaked out, and my niece could hear the entire conversation, so I rush her home.

The next day we talk, where she explains that she was so upset because I didn't clear the outing with her first. Nevermind that's never once been a ""rule"", but whatever. By the end, I apologize, and she's on her high horse. She clearly had no idea how much her reaction had hurt me. To think even for a second that I could ever ""kidnap"" her kid...

Anyway, am I the asshole because, since then, I've ignored her calls and texts, unless absolutely necessary (like when she told me she's going to be late on the car payment that's in my name because she couldn't get approved)?

EDIT: I want to make it clear that I have, historically, always been able to pick up the kids at any time and hang out with them, never needing to run it by my sister first. The only exception, understandably, has been anything overnight."
1374,azdt46,"AITA for asking a guy how big his dick is after he asks how much I weigh? So there's this guy in our friend group who asked me out on a date. Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.

It stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said ""excuse me?"". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said ""you weigh more than me"".

I didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, ""What was the point of that question?"" and he said ""I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything."" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.

In the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was ""just a question"" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about ""a damn question"". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this ""double standard""?

So I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said ""Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?"" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. ""Tell me, how big is it?"" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.

They said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?"
1375,cno4cu,"AITA for wanting to distance myself from my father? Ever since I was a kid, I liked the approval of my father and his company. Until I was 12 and we were in a ""poorer"" condition (middle-lower class) we played games together and spent time together, even if he only had me for a day a week (He had shared custody with my mother, my mother having me during the weeks except wednesdays and alternating weekends). 

&#x200B;

That all changed after. I kept the attitude and inviting him to play with me and spending time with me but he started saying he was too busy and could not. This went on for 2/3 years until I had to leave my mother's house because she was mentally unstable and I was a victim of mental abuse for close to 2 and a half years. 

&#x200B;

I moved to my father's house and the situation worsened. He stopped coming home most of the days, was always ""working"" from 5 am - 11 pm and always far away. We stopped doing things together and eventually I started to wonder if something was wrong with me or with my actions. Eventually I broke down in front of him when I told him I finished the year with very good grades (European, on a scale 1-20 I had 16,5 avg) and he didn't tell me praise, he just asked me why didn't I have better and that I should not be proud. I told him we stopped being together and I just wanted a little bit of positive energy from him and that we should work on our communication problems. He told me that if there are any it was only from my part and that I should work on them privately. He's an ""old-school man"". I have only seen him crying once, when my grandma passed away. 

&#x200B;

Ever since the only thing that changed was that instead of spending time with me he just gave me material presents. A new laptop, a new gaming console, new games, all things that a teenager and young adult loves and wants. The problem is that I would have preferred his attention and to spend time with him. Also, he got a new girlfriend when I was 18 and he changed for the worse meaning he always puts me down and is even less time home. 

&#x200B;

I went to uni far away from home and I just didn't feel homesick, except for my girlfriend that went to the same city I did for university. I am 21 now. I have given up on my relationship with my father and I don't expect anything more than just ""acquaintance"". Now, whenever he wants to do something I just refuse and I just stay home on the weekends. I got tired of his refusals so I don't invite him anymore to anything and I don't want to spend time with him because I know it won't be happy for me. It makes me sad that he valued more the Money he earned and spent than time he should have had with me.

1376,bqog41,"AITA For Not Wanting My Friends At My Home? My boyfriend and I have been living together for almost two years now. We have a set of old college friends we invite to our apartment from time to time.  Recently, it's become a weekly affair. They come here to drink and watch Game of Thrones.

Now, that's perfectly fine, but a part of me dreads having them over because of the clean up required after every session. The dishes mound and there's just so much dirt everywhere.

Sometimes, even though we tell them to eat ahead of time for GOT night, some of them come without eating so we're forced to offer food meant only for two people. At the end of the night, I have to buy extra food for myself because birth control pills will make me feel nauseous if I'm left hungry.

There are times they don't respect my concerns regarding space (our dinning area can only host 8 people comfortably). They had a party once and invited more than 12 people despite my concern over space. When I expressed that concern, one of my friends me they had no problem with it at all, that I didn't have to worry about not having enough space - something which really irked me because this was my home, and not theirs, and it felt like they weren't respecting my boundaries.

Last night, I snapped and threw a little tantrum. We had gone on a beach trip with our friends, and suddenly, everyone but us decided to come back to our house to finish the left over food. No one even asked whether we were comfortable with the choices they were making. I would have preferred going our separate ways because I wanted to rest and deal with the remaining house chores that come with every weekend trip.

Instead, 12 people (again more than the house can comfortably accommodate) squeeze themselves into our home, cook the leftover food, use up all the dishes, and muddy the floor. What's worse was that there wasn't any water at home yet (the water service is unstable during summer). I snapped because I was tired and would eventually have to deal with all the mess left behind.

My bf and I occasionally fight about this issue I have with our friends, because he says he doesn't mind doing the extra work for them. Personally, I'm just tired of playing host.

Sure, the bf helps out in cleaning from time to time, something which I'm grateful for, but most of the time, I take the brunt of the work. I wouldn't mind doing the clean up, but they come over every week (sometimes twice in a week) and it exhausts me. I am introverted and I am very particular about the space I live in.

Am I the asshole for wanting a clean and comfortable home?"
1377,awxpy5,"AITA for expecting my wife to still agree with the deal we made 5 years ago? This situation is complicated. My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always ""in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family."" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.



The summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still ""in the future"" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.



A few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. 


So here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.



So that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.



When I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.



Edit1- thank you to everyone who commented so far. I am trying to respond to anyone who requests more information. Something that I think was misspoken in the original post is that I would not be hooking up with these women. It would be a direct sperm donation. For my one friend, her husband would be present."

My brother has been seeing a girl for close to a year now. He really loves her and is planning to propose but I’m still getting used to her as a person. For me, she’s very overwhelming and somewhat difficult to tolerate (she’s loud, interrupts a lot, always needs to add her opinion instead of just listening.)

Every year we have a family Christmas dinner. Just my parents, brother and me. Even if we are in our own relationships, it’s always only the 4 of us. My parents said we “have to” invite her this year. Despite the fact that she’s already spending Thanksgiving with us and inviting her brother and his girlfriend (who we’ve never met).

On top of this, my brother and I were planning on going to Disney World next year. We were supposed to go this year but couldn’t because of work. Last week he said to me, “Hey I know you wanted to come but I’m taking the girlfriend instead.” My brother is my best friend.

1380,bystwj,"WIBTA for ditching a friend because she is still friends someone I hate? So basically, there’s this girl, S. S was my first friend at my new school, and as a result I’ve known her for a lot longer than this other girl, X. X is my best friend (though I’m only one of hers), pretty much my only friend, and I love hanging out with her.  X is also very good friends with S.

The trouble with S is that she’s recently started to ignore me. When I’m in a group with her, she’ll only talk to the others; she won’t look at me, and will basically pretend I’m not there. Because she won’t talk to me, I can’t really confront her. Through mutual friends I found out that she’s doing that because apparently I’m bad for her mental health - I’m over-competitive, constantly arguing, always trying to one up her. Which is funny, because that’s what she’s been doing to me. 

I had decided to just let S do her own thing, but I wanted to remain friends with X. So X invites me over to hang out, and I say yeah sure, but just before I actually leave to go over there, X tells me that S will be there too. I can’t back out, and I spend the night trying not to engage too much with S. Then S all but tells X something I didn’t want ANYONE to know, something I didn’t want S to find out, and something I expressly told her to keep secret: that I actually had sex with my now ex boyfriend, who is now dating S. I have a lot of regrets there, and would prefer to say that it didn’t happen. 

Eventually, I just decide to leave. Then X posts a whole set of photos of her and S being friends, dressing up together, all stuff that they’ve done since I left. In addition, the only class I share with X, I also share with S, and S makes an effort to sit between me and X every time. Altogether, it feels like S is trying to cut me off from my other friends. I’ve tried talking to X about S, but X wants to stay friends and be nice with S. I can’t really fault that, but I do know that I can’t handle S weaselling away all of her attention while cutting me off from her. 

So, reddit, WIBTA if I decide to stop being friends with X because she is still friends with S?

1381,eqiy1p,"WIBTA for asking my manager and co-workers to stop mentioning and discussing the fact that I’m pregnant? I applied for my dream job shortly after I found out I was pregnant. The interview/language examination took a couple of months, and I started the position at 17 weeks along. At first, it felt like people were really supportive of me following my dreams even though I’m pregnant.  Lately , I’ve noticed that there have been some comments made that don’t feel all that supportive. I was introduced at a big meeting as the “new team member who was hired permanently but will be leaving on mat leave soon” , tasks seem to be delegated unnecessarily around “well you’re leaving in a few months so we won’t offer you this”, and since my job involves travel and time on my feet, people are unnecessarily assuming/telling me I can’t do certain things. It’s really making me angry, as I spent 8 years in university to obtain this specific job and am perfectly healthy/capable of fulfilling my duties until I go on maternity leave. WIBTA if I asked everyone to just forget that I’m pregnant and go about business as usual until a medical professional decides differently?"
1382,evzkf3,"AITA for not wanting to share my late grandmother's sunglasses with my brother?  My grandmother passed away and my family  went throgh her stuff a few years ago. I found these nice vintage sunglasses she had from the 80s and I kept them. I wear them from time to time and keep them safe in a sunglass case when not wearing them bc I want them to stay perfect.

My brother (who lives out of town) was not there when we went through her stuff. The next time I saw him he noticed the glasses and I was happy to tell him they were our grandmother's. He said he liked them too and he started asking to wear them sometimes when he's in town. This last time (last weekend) he asked to wear  them and then took them back home with him to his state even though I told him no. 

I texted to ask if he really took my sunglasses and he says they're ""family heirloom glasses"" and he needs them for vacation 😑.

1383,c4eqd3,"AITA for asking my roommate and his girlfriend to split the rent 3 ways? This happened about 3 years ago, but it still bothers me cause I lost my best friend cause of this. 

My best friend and I decided to move in together after we both got out of long relationships with our SO.

Initially I was apt hunting for myself. I never had a roommate because I never really wanted one. One day we were hanging out and I had an appointment to view an appointment so I decided to bring him along. I didn't like the apartment so didn't take it. While on our way to play basketball he suggests we should roommate together. Now I wasn't against it, but I love my space and agreed if we got a big enough spot. We found a spot. A four bedroom duplex. Downstairs was 2 bedrooms 2 baths upstairs 2 bedrooms 1 bath. I agreed to pay more cause I had the room with the bathroom. Fast forward 2 years he gets into a relationship and asks if his girl can move in. They had also bought a dog together who stayed with us. He purchased the dog without even asking me if it was ok. I didn't say anything just like ""oh cool"". I would like to mention the apt was under my name my deposit and all my furniture. He only had his bedroom set and never bought anything else. When he asked me if she could move in I said yes but we would have to split the rent 3 ways. He was upset and said why if they were going to use one room. The extra room upstairs was already filled with her clothes and other of their personal belongings dog cage ect. I made it clear that it was going to be their room as well. He didn't agree called me selfish and moved out 15 days later with her and stopped being my friend.  AITA for asking to split the rent 3 ways?"
1384,ewjsru,"AITA for telling my husband he needs to see a therapist if he’s unemployed? My husband and I have been married for just over a year, together for over 4. 

At one point, I had gotten an offer for a job far away from home, a good 6+ hours of driving away. The opportunity was good, so I asked my husband (boyfriend at the time) if he would mind moving. We would be away from friends and family, but I would be able to support us. He hated his job, so he quit and we moved. 

In the nearly two years I was at that job, he couldn’t find work. He’s in tech, so it was competitive, and we were in a place with not many jobs. He got so low during that time. He was constantly depressed, gained weight, talked about himself poorly, wouldn’t leave the house for days. I worked, cooked and cleaned, and took care of him. I’ve never said this to him, but it was a terrible burden on me. I was terribly depressed then and it still affects me, because I felt like I was his caretaker and not his partner. 

Fast forward to now, about another two years later. He has another job he hates, while I mostly provide. I plan our meals, our social outings, what we do with our evenings, grocery trips, chores, etc. but he is able to financially contribute (I pay our bills while he saves what he makes.) We have talked about him quitting, and I told him he needs to start planning. He doesn’t have a solid plan in mind and keeps joking about it. 

I told him he needs to have a deadline, and that, for the sake of both our mental health, he needs to see a therapist or counselor if he’s off work (we are covered by my insurance). He didn’t take kindly to the suggestion and initially ignored me. In the past, he’s told me he doesn’t like therapy and he doesn’t want to “dig anything up” by going. I have a much more positive outlook on mental health and treat therapy like a check-up for your brain. 

He also told me “I can talk to you” when I mentioned he needs someone to talk to. When I told him it was requisite for him to see a therapist if he’s unemployed, I asked “do you understand?” after he started ignoring me to browse the internet and he snapped “yes, I understand”.

AITA? I hate acting like his mom but I can’t stand the idea of continuing to act as the sole provider AND his personal therapist."
1385,bnt0hx,"AITA for getting mad at my SO for him not letting me hang up a picture of my dead best friend? Using a throwaway account because my boyfriend knows my actual username. 
My boyfriend and I recently moved in together.  Today we were hanging up pictures in the apartment.  We created a photo wall of family, friends, etc in the main hallway.  When I went to hang up a picture of one of my best friends from high school that passed away 10 years ago, my boyfriend stated, “That can’t go there.”  Thinking he meant that it shouldn’t go in said spot, I moved it to the other side.  “No,” he said, “I meant on the wall.”  I asked why, to which he said he doesn’t feel comfortable seeing a picture of me and another guy on the wall.  Mind you, my friend has been gone for 10 YEARS.  My boyfriend isn’t typically the jealous type, and he’s always pretty chill with what I do.  But, this is something I never thought he would say, so I’m pretty pissed and shocked.  I snapped and told him that I’d put his picture wherever I damn please.  I understand that it’s his space as well, and he absolutely has a say where things should be placed.  His reasoning behind it is what’s bothering me, though.
So, Reddit, am I the asshole here?

1386,bt906j,"WIBTA if I push the issue and risk losing my female employee her privilege of wearing shorts at work? So last fall I became the business manager at a small toy store. The two old men that were running the place don't have the energy to keep up with it anymore and I needed a change from my banking/analytics career path.

Both around 65 they have very... interesting opinions about things. The topic of summer dress code came up and I learned that the guys (myself and one college part-timer) have to wear long pants throughout, while the girls (one college part-timer) can wear shorts should she choose.

I think that's fucked up.

The explanation I was given was that they come from a time where men wear pants when they work, elderly customers expect the men to wear pants and that nobody wants to see a man's legs.

My thoughts on these reasons are as follows: 
1. My legs should be sculpted from marble, they are glorious.
2. It's a goddamn toy store.
3. Does it follow then that the reason she is allowed to wear shorts is because the owners and customers DO want to see this 19 year olds legs?

The owners have a history of big ol fuck ups when it comes to customer relations. For example: yesterday one was loudly telling a store about kids looking up a skirt at a tattoo parlor.

The three possible outcomes I can see here are that I get myself and the other guy the ability to wear shorts, I lose my female employee the right to wear shorts, or I'm fired."
1387,dbuodt,"WIBTA if I cut my sister out of my life Using throwaway..

  I don't think I am in the wrong but just wanted to check with the sub if I am overreacting. 

  My older sister (49F) is a bit of a loudmouth. I (47m) have two other younger siblings. We are all pretty close but a realization just dawned on me  that my older sister has been a bit of a saboteur all my life. This realization came because of an incident that happened recently. 

Background: When we were younger, my sister used to be really good singer.  I loved to sing as a child but every time I tried, I was told by my sister how horrible I was at it. My mom backed her up too. So, I always assumed I couldn't sing and that it was a skill one was born with. 

  This stayed with me all my life. About a year ago, I decided this is something I really have to give a shot. I did some research and learned that with enough training and practice one can get reasonably decent at it.   I have been taking lessons for over a year now and have improved quite a bit. I recently sang at a large gathering. People really liked my performance and I got a bunch of kudos for it. I sent the video to my family. My sister called and completely flew off the handle. Telling me that I was wasting my time and that I couldn't sing. She ranted for quite a bit. I told her I was not looking for her encouragement or validation. This is a hobby and I am happy with where I am at and hung up. 

  But then I got thinking. I was taken aback by her reaction. I started thinking back to all the things that have ever transpired between us and came to the realization that she has always been sabotaging me. Not in a super obvious way but very strategically placed sabotages here and there. She would ruin my relationships with some well placed 'harmless' comments here and there. Nip away at my self-esteem at every opportunity. She even had me believing for a long time as children that I was adopted (She claims this was a joke). This has been a pattern all my life. She is not even self-aware to know what she has been doing and will absolutely not acknowledge any of it if I brought it up. She will laugh it off and gaslight me if I bring it up. 

  I don't doubt that in her own way she loves me. I am just perplexed at this behavior since I have had the realization of her sabotaging behavior. On my part, I think I have been great with all my siblings. I am very successful in life and I have made it a point to help them out as much as possible monetarily and in other ways. She has borrowed from me in the high five figures over the years and I have never even asked her to ever repay it. 

About ten years ago, I started cutting out all the toxic people from my life. This has worked really well for me and made my life much simpler. Now I am wondering if I need to dissociate from my toxic sister. I am considering severing all contact with her. 

Would I be an overreacting asshole if I did that?"
1388,bzjyks,"AITA for not even trying to force my teen/preteen kids to pick up after themselves? I have two boys, 14 and 10 years old. One year ago we moved in with my boyfriend, into his very beautiful house. 

My side...My kids leave stuff around sometimes like cereal bowls, socks near the couch and backpacks by the door. If I ask them to clean up anything, help with anything or do a chore, they do it right away, no complaints, ever. I achieved that with a system from when they were little where if I asked them to do something and if they even non verbally complained, I gave them three more jobs. So this works for me. About once a day, I look around and ask them to come get their things. The house is generally very clean and organized. They also clean their rooms at least once a week and they handle their own laundry when it’s clean and dry. They make their own lunches every day and take the garbage out whenever I ask. If they forgot to bring a dish to the sink etc. I just ask them to come and get it. They help out a lot. 

His side...My boyfriend says I am not doing enough to teach my kids to handle any messes as they go. He feels he is being disrespected if they leave items around the house. If he sees something they left he yells about it to me. He says he is not necessarily yelling at me, but I am usually the only one in the room when he discovers something left behind that does not belong in the common areas. He does all this with a very offended tone and it is stressful for everyone. He has even thrown items at me when he found them, disgusted. He is especially mad that there hasn’t been much improvement over the year that we have lived here. 

I do care about his feelings. I have worked with the kids quite a bit on expectations in the house. However, I am honestly asking AITA, because I do feel like having to immediately check on everything you are doing is something you do when you are a guest, and not when you are at home. I feel very satisfied with their level of responsibility and help. I do get mad at them, but I choose things that are more important for me to focus on like grades, homework, kindness to one another, being a part of the team when I ask. 

My boyfriend is very kind and supportive to them outside this issue. It causes the most conflict between us rather than between him and them. I find myself constantly worried he is going to bring down my whole night because somebody left a shirt near the couch. You would think if I was so worried about it that I would work more with my kids on it, but I just don’t really know how to get them to have all their stuff cleaned up real time. AITA?

Edit: he threw them in my general direction because he was frustrated. He was not aiming to hurt or even make contact with me."
1389,axcl2j,"WIBTA for wanting to cut my mom off if she keeps smoking/drinking I've (25f) been debating giving my mom (50s,f) an ultimatum. Im tired of her chainsmoking when Im around and not having respect for my health. She also drinks 2-3 beers/alcoholic drinks on her normal days. This wouldnt be a problem if she didnt underestimate her limit (she weighs a lot less now but thinks she can handle it the same).   She becomes so overbearing when she drinks and I always just want to leave. I do not drink or smoke, so this is important to me.
I was pushed over the edge because of a trip I took with them over the weekend to visit my brothers family. Its a 10ish hour drive to and from and the whole time her and her bf smoked 1-2 cigarettes each an hour. Its their car, they're driving, I toughed it out on the way there.
Now on our way back, Im sick (Sore throat, runny nose, etc.) They lit up the entire time. I told them when there was about 4 hrs left, no more smoking. I was getting seriously nauseous at that point. 
Im just so tired of her addictions and how she acts when I confront her about it. I just dont to be around it anymore. Would I be an Asshole if I cut her off because of these things?"
1390,efx51t,"AITA for saying that I want a specific gender when I have a baby? I (26f) am not pregnant. When at my sister and brother in laws (28), my SIL asked “What (gender) do you want to have?” I said a boy without hesitation. She seemed surprised and asked again if I didn’t want a girl, and I said again “I only want boys.” 

To me, this was like the convos I have with my mom or sister etc where it’s a very surface level preference, and not an end all be all topic. 

Later that night, my SIL/BIL sat me down and said they were disappointed that I would say such a thing out loud in front of my niece and other women in the room. SIL said that her mom (my MIL) once said that if she had a boy first, she’d stop having kids and that statement left her feeling sad ever since. They said that they’ll all remember this conversation and that “when you’re ‘stuck’ with a little girl, we’ll all know you didn’t want her,” and more ultimatums of the same. Context:  They have a 9 month old daughter after having two miscarriages. 

To be clear: I DONT CARE what gender my “baby” is, if I ever have kids. AITA?

Editing to add: when I answered, it was while making gingerbread houses and in what I thought was a lighthearted conversation, so it was more of a joke and less of a serious answer. I didn’t know they were going to take it seriously at all, and I definitely didn’t mean that if I had a girl that I would love or treat it any less.

I (32f) and my long term partner (36m) have been together for around 7 years. We BOTH have friends of the opposite sex. It’s never been an issue... except for one.  

She and my partner have been friends since college and she has always had a “thing” for him. Until recently it’s never really played out. However, for some reason lately she has been really aggressive in her pursuit of my significant other. She has been critical of our relationship and myself, has tried to convince him to cheat on me, and when he said he would not cheat on me, she became verbally abusive towards him as well as me. 

They haven’t seen each other in probably 4-5 years, so this all is going down via text message. After the last tirade, she went silent for a few months. He and I talked about her behavior and agreed that she was out of line. However, earlier tonight her name popped up on his phone notification screen.  I don’t snoop. The text tone went off and I saw her name when I glanced over. 

I know if I ask him he will be honest and tell me what she said. He always has been.  My problem is that I don’t forget and forgive as easily.  I’m thinking about asking him to end the friendship, something I would never think to do prior to this situation. Which makes me think that I might be the future asshole...

Edit: I forgot to mention, she recently lost a sibling. And while the pursuit was there, it was after the death that she became VERY aggressive about it. It’s part of the reason I think my partner doesn’t just cut her out completely."
1392,b70hkk,"AITA for disliking a man I willingly donated money to? Mobile + Throwaway account. 

Recently, I joined a small, tight-knit community with people from all places and situations. 

One of these guys is a pretty active member of the group, he’s going to college and understandably, there is some financial strain on his family, and they’re already not the most well-off. At this time his house turned out to have some pretty serious issues with the roof. They’ve been having leaks and need over ten thousand dollars to have it entirely redone. This, on top of supporting a kid in college, is tough.

He voiced his concerns in the group, and those who could pitched in. I had some money left over, so I donated 40 bucks. A pittance, but I’m not officially employed, and when I do make money, it’s far below minimum wage because it’s not an actual job. All of us working together barely got over 100$, but we apologized for not being able to help out more. 

Not even a few days later, he’s in the group chat bragging about a new gaming laptop his grandparents just gave him. The thing costed over a thousand dollars, brand new, and he wasn’t shy on showing it off and telling everyone about what it could run. I was a little hurt and confused when I heard this. Turns out his grandparents aren’t on the best terms with his parents, and so they didn’t chip in for the house redos. I understood that.

But what I didn’t get at all is why he didn’t sell the laptop and buy a cheaper work one, adding perhaps 700-800$ to the family funds to pay for the roof so that they wouldn’t have to go online to ask for donations. The grandparents would understand because they adore him, and why not use this as an opportunity to convince them to help them as a favor to their grandson, who has to live in the house?

He also has both PS and Xbox gaming consoles, alongside a dedicated gaming pc and now this new gaming laptop, as I later found out, which just adds to my confusion. He currently, to my knowledge, does not hold a job, not even part-time or on campus jobs.

I will NOT be asking for my money back. They still need that tiny bit of money I can give, and I won’t shame them for choosing to do what they do. I just involuntarily get a sour taste whenever I see that guy again, knowing that my money may have served as a justification by him to keep his expensive new gaming laptop. 

I voiced my concerns once, but he dismissed it as “it wouldn’t sell for as much because it’s used now,” which is very true, but you’re still looking at something that could fetch over 800$ (at that time, he had it for less than a week.)

AITA for not wanting to talk to him and for thinking he’s not doing the right thing and being selfish and shortsighted? I would never say these to his face, but I feel guilty for thinking these thoughts.


TL;DR Guy who needs money got my donation, has expensive gaming equipment lying around, isn’t contributing to family funds. AITA for thinking he’s selfish and lazy?"
1393,etw18a,"WIBTA if I started my own phone plan? Okay so this is actually my first time posting on here and I’m on mobile so please bare with me. I’m gonna try and not make this super long. 


So I (19,F) was living with my mom and my brother, as my parents are divorced. My dad, per their divorce agreement, was responsible for paying the cable. At the time, we didn’t have WiFi. So I got WiFi, and me and my brother split the cost. No biggie. So after a few months, my dad asks if I can add cable into my WiFi bill, and he’d pay for the cable each month. No biggie, so I said sure. Everything was fine for a few months, he’d pay me the money, all good. 

After a few months, me and my boyfriend started renting a house together. My brother moved out shortly after. My dad then basically told me I had to pay $45 towards the cable for my “cell phone bill.” I was like “okay sure that’s very reasonable” A few more months go by, and my dad hasn’t been paying his share of the bill. He gave me $100 back in October (it is now January) The bill has changed and costs more than originally, my brother moved back in, and the cable bill is currently negative $300. I was trying to pay all of it so it wouldn’t get to this point, but I ran into some unexpected financial issues & had to move in with my in laws. Still trying to get back on track. 

I am the only one on the bill, so I know I’m responsible and this will soon effect my credit. I still no longer live there. I told my dad about a week ago about different options for him to do, and that I want to cancel the cable and WiFi, return the equipment, and set up a payment plan to slowly pay off the -$300. And I of course would still send him the money each month for my phone bill. This is where it gets tricky. 

After I told him this, he said “well I don’t feel like dealing with your phone anymore” “As long as I am paying your phone bill then you can pay for cable.” “If you want to keep your phone number, you have to pay me $100 a month” So I told him, “Nah I’m fine, I’ll get my own phone plan. I’ll drop my phone off to you after I switch it over. Make sure you have something figured out for the cable so I can cancel it and return the equipment. “ So after this my dad got mad because he realized I’m serious. Dad says “And now your going to stick me with your phone bill and phone that I’m going to have to pay for” 

So this where y’all come in. He basically told me I could pay him $75 a month for my phone bill, just so he’s not stuck with the whole thing. WIBTA if I told him no thanks, and just went and got my own phone plan? I feel very conflicted because I don’t want to screw my dad over, but he’s screwed me over as well, as I’m still left with the -$300 cable bill"

My next door neighbors are going out of town for the holiday season and want to know if they can drop their cat off with me. They’ll be gone about two weeks in another state, and can’t bring the cat with them. I love animals, and have a cat of my own who would love the company, so I enthusiastically agreed to the arrangement. However, apparently, their cat has a habit of getting into the toilet paper, and running all over their house with it in his mouth and ripping it up - basically just wasting their TP. To correct this, they want me to hit the cat with the cardboard part of a wire hanger whenever it shows interest in TP while at my house. They say it’s been working for them and thanks to this technique, he hasn’t gotten into the paper as much and they think they can break the habit if they keep it up. I do *not* want to do that. I’m not doing it. But I also don’t want to tell them I won’t do it, and have them go ask someone else in the neighborhood who *would* do it. They also do other minor nonos, like bathing the cat once a week, letting it outside when it’s not fixed, and feeding it dry food rather than wet which my vet tells me is better. WIBTA if I basically lied and told them I would do what they wanted, but instead just... not?

ETA: Commenters have told me dry food actually *isnt* all that bad for the cat, and changing his diet suddenly would make him sick. I thought most cats eat wet food, my mistake. I’ll leave his food be.

ETA 2: I’m not saying I’m going to change his whole routine. I’m willing to do everything the way they do, except hit the cat, and maybe not let him outside, because I would hate for him to get hurt on my watch."
1395,aznj1x,"AITA for telling my mom how much I hate being a girl everyday? So I'm 15. Yeah, pretty rocky start, eh? Teenage hormones and stuff.

So I think I might have gender dysphoria. It hits extremely hard sometimes, to the point where I start hyperventilating and crying and shutting down. I don't have any mirrors in my room anymore, and I try not to be in any pictures. It just pains me everyday. I'm extremely depressed over this.

Anyways, I don't like confrontation. I don't like talking to my mom about this in real life because it pisses her off. At school, I text her a lot during my breaks and open up about how much I hate being a girl, and how I wished I had been born a boy instead, and asking my mom for what to do. My mom keeps ignoring me, and trying to point out that women are better than men, or saying stuff like ""Yeah but we can cover up our flaws with makeup! And have kids! And do all wonderful sorts of things!"" and other ""advantages"" that aren't actually advantages, or anything I'm interested in.

I don't have anywhere or anybody else to vent out to , so she's my only option. The thought of a diary popped up, but I don't want to have a typically feminine hobby like that.

So obviously, I'm extremely depressed over this, right? And whenever I text my mom to vent, she just gets angry and says ""Why can't you just love yourself? I love myself!"" ""It's just a phase that all girls go through, give it some time."" If she's true about the phase thing, what an awful fucking thing all girls have to go through, yet another reason why I hate being female.

I honestly truly hate it, and my mom doesn't want me ""talking shit about her own gender"" and making her ""feel a bit upset"" about how I'm feeling. She acts like she wants to do what's good for me, but all she does is make me feel worse, and she knows it.

(She won't let me see a doctor for this, but I don't think this is a necessary point in this story)

Idk I've just always been really uncomfortable with pda and I have some trauma that makes things of a sexual anture hard for me too so when I hear them borderline going at it it makes me really upset. I'm too scared to confront hem about it because it might cause a blow up and their relationship is questionably toxic as is AND they're long distance so they don't see each other in person very often besides when our friend group meets up. There's three others besides them and we're all becoming increasingly uncomfy. We don't know what to do and I feel like a total asshole telling them I'm uncomfortable with them being together at night in the adjacent room or on the couch with those of us trying to sleep.

1397,bbk8pu,"AITA For being scared of someone whose done nothing wrong? WARNING: LONG POST

So for background, I recently became friends with a new student. He's in all my classes, and we became friends immediately. Nothing odd here.

We soon found out we had a LOT in common, down to what instruments we learned in primary school, what order we learned them in, and when we started/quit them. Same with playing soccer. it became a joke to write them all down, and the list was huge.

So recently, he confessed to having a crush on me. He didn't ask me out, just admitted it. I politely told him I didn't feel that way, but that I really valued the friendship we had.
He wasn't really touchy feely before, but just before he fessed up, and especially after, he started getting really close to me physically. Poking me, putting his hand on my shoulders. When I flinched away he'd just pat my shoulder again. 
Today, actually, was sitting with other friends, on a table with benches, that sits 3 on each long side, two on the short. He and I were just on one side, and I was practically on the edge because of how close to me he was. Thankfully, another friend casually pointed out how much space there was and he moved.
The real kicker, the one that got me, was in Biology. I made a paper boat, and then a smaller one. I wanted to see how small I could go (bored in class) and I ended up making a TINY one. He snatched it and practically crushed it. Laughed and held his arm away as I tried to get it back. It was serious to me, I was really proud of it because I'm not usually good at arts and crafts.

The next day, in another class, I was making boats again. He stole some of my (special) paper, made his own and tried to add it to my pile??
Like boi, you can't mock me for this and then try to join in.

He has been over my house twice, while I was tutoring him for Chemistry (before the creepy stuff, it's  unrelated - nothing happened)
But now he wants me to come over to his place to see his new puppy, and I'm kinda freaked out. I don't know if we'll be alone or not.

He doesn't seem to listen when I'm (mildly) upset, and gets a little too touchy-Feely. I'm kinda worried he'll try to tickle me or something like that, something he thinks is harmless, but at the same time he won't listen to me when I ask him to stop and it'll end up something worse. I don't know if I'm overreacting or not.

TLDR: Friend started making me uncomfortable, wants me to come over to his place possibly alone and I don't know if I'm overreacting or not.

Any comments would help!

EDIT: A lot have people have told me that he seems creepy, but I genuinly don't believe he's intentionally doing it. He just doesn't understand my boundaries"
1398,aifr3w,"AITA I got with my boyfriends best friend Ok, let me break this down... this is a long one sorry ...

I was with my former boyfriend, lets call him A for two years. The last year of those two years we were long distance (he dropped out of university and moved home) and his family weren't too keen on the whole long distance thing. By the end we were seeing each other 1 day a month. 

During our relationship he lied, stole money from me, always victimised himself, cheated on me ... when I called him out on it, his answer was 'I'm a 21 year old boy. If another girl gives me attention, I cant help it' 

I should of seen the warning signs ! But I'm kind of old fashioned and i like the idea of working at and fixing relationships when they go wrong. 

So I was leaving University and our plan was for me to move up to live with him. It had got to 6 weeks before I was moving up. I saw him on the weekend and left on the Sunday... and on the Monday he calls to break up with me, saying things didnt feel the same.

This was devastating as suddenly I had no future stability ! It was strange but after being sad for 3 days, I realised I had gotten over him. 

Cue 6 months later where I have fallen in love with B (his best friend). We would hang out a lot as best friends during mine and A's relationship cos we lived close and there was never a single sexual intent. 

It hit me like a ten tonne truck when, after I became single and A broke up with me, that all these feelings would rush into me regarding B. We would continue hanging out as friends and my crush for B would grow and grow. Like the most organic love that I have ever felt.

So me and B fell deeper and deeper in love (honestly 4 years later and he is still the perfect man) and decided to be in a relationship. 

So B had to ring A and explain what had happened. Obviously A did not take it well at all. I was travelling at the time and didnt get the full scoop... and didnt want to pry. 

So a year later I contacted A saying things about extending an olive branch, and him telling me he went to therapy over the whole thing. And friendship between him and B was beyond repairing. 

Fast forward another year, A keeps sending me this cryptic messages at 3am and 4am that dont make much sense. About him being unhappy. He asked me next time I'd be in London so he could talk about his life and stuff and I replied 'but I thought you didnt like me much ?? And he replied 'yea maybe I dont.' And then said he broke up with his current gf and I said 'ouch :(' and he snapped 'I dont need sympathy from you.'

 He even tried to call me twice but I didnt pick up. 

I ended all these messages by telling him harshly to leave me alone and delete my number and let me live my life. 

I mentioned it to a friend the other week and she laughed said I really screwed A over. 

But from time to time I still think back and wish things ended differently...

Am I the asshole ???"
1399,d6ynfu,"AITA (28/f) for not letting my mother (55/f) use my car? I guess I’ll start from three months ago. I left for France to work. My mother’s car is broken and she asked me could she pay my car payment that month and use my car, I said absolutely.

Long story short, she continued to use my car while I paid the payments. 

When I got back into the country I found that not only had she been using my car everyday, but they had also taken several long road trips using my car. My car was packed full of things from their road trips and dirty. 

I am living here at the moment rent free, so I made a small comment, but wrote it off as a fair trade because of the living situation. 

We have been planning all week to go to the farmers market and placed a big order to pick up. I’ve been excited all week. We get in my car and she starts shoving coolers in almost tearing my seats. I say “are you making sure they aren’t snagging the seats when you put them in?”. She says “yes”. She continues to do this, so I show her where it’s pulling my interior. She then yanks the cooler out (just as carelessly). I ask her what she’s doing and she says putting it in the trunk since I’m worried about my seats (pointless since it was already in, but ok). 

She gets in the car and I ask her can she please respect my car, It’s still fairly new and I’m still paying payments, and I feel that she needs to remember that it’s not her car and treat it like you are borrowing someone else’s car. 

She says she is respecting my car.

We both take a second to press the mental reset button.

I ask her if we are going to use the gps on her phone to get where we are going. She says yes and pulls out her phone. I put the car in reverse...but I’m sitting there for about 2 minutes before I look over. She’s texting her friend. I ask her if she’s going to pull up the gps because I’m sitting in reverse waiting on her. She tells me to “shut it up”.

Now I’m upset. 

I put the car in park and ask why she is sitting there texting after we just talked about using her gps and I’m waiting on her so I can drive. She starts telling my how her friend texted her and she wanted to text back before we left. I tell her she has no respect for anyone and only cares about herself. 

After this she says something else nasty to me (I honestly can’t remember because I was getting so upset and just trying to hold it together). So I turn off the car and tell her I’m not going. She doesn’t seem to care and asks if she can still use my car. I tell her no. She was visibly taken aback and then said “you’re setting something in motion right now”. I said “good”. 

After a few minutes I told her I had been really excited to go and that I was upset now at how nasty she was being and that I felt like my day was ruined and she didn’t care. 

She ignored me. I made a comment about her not answering, and she said “what exactly do you want me say back to you?”.

I told her she was a nasty person, she told me to look in the mirror, and I went inside.

So....AITA?

Edit: She left in her car, I didn’t leave her stranded."
1400,dq1lfs,"WIBTA if i stopped hanging out with someone who has a crush on me? EDIT: I cut it off with her. I told her i seriously didnt appreciate the fact she outed me, and i didn't really want to talk to her again. She asked if we could possibly be friends and i bluntly told her 99% no, you outed me. She said im sorry, i said sorry back. She then said sorry again and asked why I was saying sorry and she was calling herself a bitch. I didn't respond.

&#x200B;

basically, im bisexual. One of my (ex)friends is also bi, and i trusted her enough to tell her. I don't (romantically) like her, never have, probably never will and she knows it. on wednesday, she went up to me and told me she had caught feelings for me. It was awkward, of course, but i just told her ok, its fine, you'll eventually get over it.. I told her i dont like her and will most probably never date her. She took it ok, cried a little, but it was ok. I sound like a total asshole, i know, but i later found out this girl had told a SHIT TON OF PEOPLE about her crush. thats fine, her feelings not mine, but she told them about me too, and people assume. This crush involves me too, and i dont think she understands that you have to be more careful w same-sex crushes. She's out, I'm not. She told some of the people (about 6) i'm bi, and basically forced me to come out to them. people. i'm currently secrretly extremely mad at her, and i'm honestly thinking of just never talking to her again. Coming out is hard, and i dont want a girl who i'm not even that close with anymore casually throwing around i'm bi when im not even out.

Summary: girl has a crush on me, i tell her harshly i dont like her, find out shes told some people my sexual orientation and i want to stop talking to her because of it."

My husbands brother asked if we can come a couple days earlier so we can make it to the baby shower. 

We decided to go with our initial plans April 1st and booked our tickets. 

Here’s the reasons I don’t feel like going. 

My brother in laws girlfriend does not talk to me but will talk to everyone else. 

This will be my brother in laws 3rd baby shower. 
The first was for a pregnant girl he dated and they broke up right before the baby was born. I knew this girl from high school. We had a class together. 
The second was for a girl faking her pregnancy who managed to fake the full term. She took all of the attention away from my infant son at the time. 

And for the third-
This girl seems nice. They have been dating for... Maybe it’s been a year? 


I also don’t feel like going because I was pregnant- a week ahead of them and had a missed miscarriage and surgery. We were both due in April. I’m now pregnant again. 

I felt kinda of bad about not going but we can get them a gift after. We just found out we were flying out for my MIL major surgery and my young sister brain surgery. We are mainly there to support them

1403,c6kz9s,"AITA For Asking My Brother For Money? So last year I sold my old car to my brother and agreed to do payments since he's in a bad spot. While I wanted the full sum of the car then (about 2000), I looked at how much I owed on various things and decided I could take payments. I had planned to sell the car third-party and use the money to pay off credit card debts.

For the first few months he paid on time but then this past May he basically fell off the face of the planet. I didn't hear from him at all for about a month and when I finally did, it was from his manager at work telling me he was doing something for work and couldn't use his phone. About two weeks later I get a text from my brother saying he's back. I ask for the payments he missed ($450 total) and he said maybe and that he wasn't sure and had a lot of stuff going on financially. I then asked if ""he's just not going to pay and just ghost me"" and he told me to ""calm the fuck down and stop with the dramatics."" He then called and told me to be patient and that I was being dramatic and insensitive. Today I asked if he'd be able to make his payment for June and he told me he doesn't know.

1404,blnp24,"AITA for not wanting to let my Mother get their gas in my name? So for context: I'm 20 years old right now and I still live with my parent's. I'm currently going to college and I plan to leave and move out whenever I graduate and get a full time job. Now for what's going on I have to explain how our house is set up. 

Originally the house we live in right now was my step-grandmas house, my mother and step father moved in to ""take care"" of them and built them a nice house out of this barn. It sounds bad but it's a really nice house, but the thing is my mother constantly fuels her life with drama and is causing shit constantly with them for every. little. tiny. thing. She's going nuts now since apparently my step-grandma posted a picture of my step-brother and his mother, apparently this is very bad to my mother and my step father as it should've been a picture of my step-father and my step-brother? 

So apparently to try and kick them out and to get them to leave they're going to be dropping all the utilities on the house that belongs to my step-grandparents. Somehow this means that they are going to put the gas in their names so my mother casually says ""Yea, we were thinking about just putting it in yours."". I told her I don't want this and that she's not signing me up for something I didn't agree to, she then goes nuts saying that they're going to pay a massive deposit now cuz of it but I don't see how that's my problem.

My mother doesn't have a good track record of paying stuff, her credit score is destroyed since she tried to scam my sister for thousands and my sister threw it back into her face. I also have a $3k medical bill they never paid and never told me they didn't pay so it skyrocketed in price and now is affecting my credit score. So point overall: AITA for not wanting to put their gas in my name?"
1405,cxbwfz,"WIBTA if I didn’t invite my sister’s husband to my wedding? Context: my fiancé and I are getting married next year. My sister is kind of a train wreck: she dropped out of college after a semester, got married within MONTHS of being engaged, announced her pregnancy weeks after the wedding, and never really got around to doing anything. Her little family lives with my dad (rent free and he’s OVER IT) but here’s why I don’t want to invite her husband: he’s an awful person. He’s extremely immature and thinks he knows everything and honestly no one else in my family likes him. The biggest issue though is that when he and my sister got married, he got involved in a fight between my sister and my mom (their relationship has always had extreme ups and downs) and said some really messed up things to my mom. I’m VERY close to my mom and I’ve never forgiven him for the things he said + I hate him and all of his terrible hair choices. I do like my sister but since they’ve been together, our relationship has gone down the drain. I don’t want him at the wedding. AITA for not wanting him there? Or for sending my sister an invite without a plus one?

Edit: His hair and the fact that he’s annoying aren’t the issues . As annoying as he is, I would tolerate his presence but my issue with him started when they were getting married. my sister and mom got in an argument. For some reason he decided to step in. He called my mom a Bitch and said that she’s a terrible mother  and my sister deserves someone better. Now even if this were true (it’s not, she’s a saint) he had no place and will never have a place talk to my mom like that. He never apologized nor addressed it."

1408,eleptx,"WIBTA For Reporting Animals Neglect? I have been friends with Philip for a long time. While his dad was alive, the house was always clean. When his dad died, his mom kind of lost it. She went to work and came home and stayed in her bedroom the whole time she was home. At 14, Philip had to take care of everything, including the cats. They were fed regularly but there were 3 or 4 cats and only 1 litter box. It would get to the point where the litter was completely solid from urine and it still wouldn't get cleaned. Then, they got 2 more cats, for a total of 6. And no extra litter boxes. After a few months of having 6 cats, they decided it would be ""for the best"" if they let one go to. One of their kitties was mostly an outdoor girl - so his mom drove her out to a random place and let her loose.

In college, Philip developed seizures. They decided to get a service dog. So they bought TWO Golden Retriever pups from a breeder. However, the service dog training was ""too difficult"" so they both became pets. The pups are kept locked in the family room all day every day. They have a 6x5ft fenced in area in the yard where they're allowed out to potty but they still have accidents in the house constantly. They are not walked ever. They aren't trained, they rarely see other people, they aren't exercised or disciplined. They are ignored, plain and simple. I've tried talking to Philip about it and every time he says only one of the dogs is his responsibility. I told him that he should at least care for his dog and he says it wouldn't be fair to the other dog to favor one, and that it wouldn't be fair to him to take care of both because if he moves out, one will be neglected.

I've been feeling very upset about this wole situation already. I love animals and I've always had an issue with how they treat their pets. But I felt like it wasn't my place to say anything because I was a teenager. Now I'm an adult with my own home and animals and I'm devastated every time I think about those poor boys. I hoped it would get better but it's getting worse. I should also mention that Philip's mom is out of the house at Welding lessons, glass blowing classes, etc. several times a week. So time and money aren't a factor for why she doesn't care for the dogs herself or hire someone to walk the dogs.

2 weeks ago Philip told me that his mom got 2 more cats. She did pick up one more litter box but that's it. 7 cats, 2 dogs, 2 litter boxes, in a 3 bedroom ranch style home. I feel like those poor dogs are being neglected and that they would be happier in another home. Obviously it's not my decision to make, but I'm hoping that either they'll be told it's not acceptable and someone will keep an eye on them until the situation is better, or that the dogs and cats will be seized and taken to a shelter to find loving homes.

1409,d8htx8,"AITA for exposing my coworker of not being a military veteran? Backstory. I worked at an agency, (one that helped military vets), and I met a guy that started talking to me because he heard I was a Marine veteran.  We made small talk and he let me know he was a former Marine as well, so of course we hit it off.  Now I didnt think much of it because this guy knew his stuff...weapons, different units, deployments, he knew the info better than I did.  Fast forward a year later...I was on his Facebook for some reason and noticed there wasnt a single picture of him in uniform, (very odd as most military vets have something to show as they are usually proud of their time in).  I asked him about it and he says...""My Mom doesnt like seeing pictures of me from when I was in so I dont post them).  The wheels started spinning now, but i let it go for now.  Fast forward some more and I'm at a bar where my coworker happened to work before he served.  Got to talking to one of the workers and they told me some info about this person...said hes a compulsive liar, and that he worked there during dates that coincided with his military service.  Again, the wheels are spinning but I still dropped it as he was considered a pretty close friend now.  It wasnt until I was talking to another friend one night that i found out guy in question used to date his sister.  Apparently he told her he was a Marine as well but she worked for a National Archives agency and she looked up his info to find he never did serve. 

I'm heated.  Hes now been a good friend of mine for over a year and he works at an agency that heavily benefits military veterans.  I couldnt let this go on any longer as I am extremely against false valor.  I brought it up to my boss and an investigation insued.

Recently he has started talking about having children. I'm past the menopause, I can't have anymore naturally. But he is a teacher, and he recently told me about a student in his class with a very strict, religious family who is pregnant. My husband wanted to adopt this baby.

Now my husband is mad at me, and when I told my friend, she said I was selfish. Am I the asshole here?

Edit- Thank you so much for all the responses. I am very grateful and feel in some way relieved that I am not entirely in the wrong. I spoke to my husband. He said I am only thinking of myself, that by refusing to look after this baby I am robbing him of the chance to be a father.

I adopted a dog from her that she really really loved. It was very hard for her to be separated. And (being the idiot that I am) I suggested that he can go over to her house for a sleep over once a week. She immediately jumped on it.

So for about five or six months, I’ve been allowing my dog to go to her house and stay the night once a week. 

As a side note. She’s made it very clear she doesn’t care about me as a person, she’s only nice to me so she can continue seeing my dog. She is very rude. She’s never thanked me for letting him over. She doesn’t care about anything in my life. She really just cares about the dog. Nothing about this transaction is benefitting me and it really feels like I’m sharing custody of my pet with her and I’m being used. I’ve decided I want to do what’s best for me and no longer have him go to her house.

I know it will really upset her. She’ll probably stop being nice to me. And I really really don’t want to tell her in person. She is terrifying and gets angry easily. I have seen her scream at people at work. It is not fun. I don’t know if it’ll get that far, but I know it’ll be terrible.

I really just want to shoot her a text and let her know that I don’t want to do it anymore and I’m sorry.

Would I be the asshole if I did this? Do I have to do it in person?

Another side note: she has six dogs of her own that aren’t fosters. So. She’s definitely good on dogs."

Car 1: 1 person who who can only stay Friday to Monday

Car 2: 1 person who lives further away who can only stay until Wednesday

Car 3: Group of people leaving early Friday morning.  This group took PTO for Friday and all of the following week, so they want to leave early.

Car 4: 1 person leaving early Friday but who insists on stopping in Philadelphia on the way to eat at Reading Terminal Market.  Nobody from the other ""leaving early"" car wants to add another stop and 1-1.5 hours, plus parking/eating time, so this person would probably be in a car by himself.

Car 5: Me, leaving after work on Friday.  I'm also picking up someone along the way.  I already took PTO for the week we'll be in DC and don't want to take an extra day of PTO.  Everyone else thinks I should take an extra day of PTO so that everyone's schedules match.

I was very appreciative, though given the recent trend with R's barking, I didn't think it would be an issue. Unfortunately, when Z and R returned, R barked so much that some of the moms complained. Z asked what I would do next week if no one was around to take R out. I said that I might let R outside in our fenced backyard (with water of course).

They reassured me that I am within my rights to let R outside or cover R's kennel with a blanket (this has been effective at keeping R quiet in the past). An officer also let me know that X&Y can be given a warning for R's volume. Fed up with the way this situation was unfolding, I agreed.

1414,dlljgo,"AITA for not wanting my brother to hangout with me and my friends? So a little context, my brother (13) and I (15) are both homeschooled and have been forever. We have always been very close and even shared a room til I was about 12 and decided it was time for me to move into the extra room alone. 

The entirety of this problem started when I was almost 14 and I got my first serious girlfriend (who I’m still with).  He would always get upset whenever I wouldn’t want him to come over with me after letting him the first few times I went to her house. Both her and I got tired of him coming to her house with me so that ended. That made my father (an important part of why I posted this) upset at me and even yelled at me about not inviting my brother to things multiple times. 

As of now I’ve been with my girlfriend for almost 2 years and the chapter of my brother getting upset when he isn’t invited over has ended. Over the summer (about 2 months ago) I started Inviting 3 of my friends over almost every weekend or biweekly. My brother would always tag along with my friends and I anytime I invited them over which I have no problem with. The problem started when summer ended and I wasn’t able to see my best friend as often since I’m homeschooled. About 2 weeks ago one of my friends (I’ll call him N) invited me and the other 2 friends in the group over to stay the night for his birthday. This is the first time he’s ever had more than 1 of us over at a time due to his bedroom being very small. When my brother found out he wasn’t invited he was sad but not angry or upset. My father and mother however both got unreasonably upset at me (atleast I feel it was unreasonable) and called (N) a dick and said that he was just a fake person who I’m gonna end up drifting away from anyway, and that my brother is the only person who will ever be there for me. They talked to me angrily (not really yelling but they where mad) for about an hour. My brother even chimed in saying that he didn’t mind not going because they are my friends and he understands that. They still didn’t let up though. He eventually ended up going over to N’s house for the day and left after dinner. 

I plan on going to see a movie with N this week and don’t plan on inviting my brother even after I told me father i would see if he could go. Am I The Asshole?"

As I'm walking home a guy, who looked to be mid 20s, drives up behind me and hits a puddle of water right on the street, hitting it at a perfect angle to splash ice cold water all over my clothes and my face and hands. His window was down just a little ways for God knows what reason and I could hear him laughing as he drove away. I immediately start running full speed after the guy, and while I'm not fast enough to catch a car as it's driving top speed down a road, I got lucky that he was turning into a neighborhood and I catch him. I stop the guy and absolutely light into him, using all forms of profanity that I won't dare use here. AITA?"
1416,ellfpe,"AITA for telling my boyfriend not to lend money to his mother? My boyfriend (27M) and I (26F) have been together for 8 years now (been together since college). A year ago, we finally moved in together. 

Everything was pretty okay until my boyfriend started making late payments. His share of the rent, electricity, gas, groceries, etc. It's never been a big deal because I've been able to cover his share and he hasn't not paid me back so far. This had been happening for the past 2 months so last week, I finally asked him what was going on. He said that he'd been lending money to his mom to pay off her cr

We had a long, long, *long* discussion about that, but we basically agreed he wouldn't do that anymore. If his mother needed to borrow money from him, fine, but not at the expense of his own household bills. He also said he'd talk to her and tell her that.

Well today she sent me a text calling me a selfish bitch. She said it was her son's duty to look after her. I got pissed off and replied that she has a job, so why can't she pay her own credit card bill? She then said that she's still raising another kid (my boyfriend's half-brother) and that I wouldn't understand because my money only goes to me. I then told her she could argue all she wanted but my boyfriend was done prioritizing giving her money over paying his share of the household bills, then I blocked her number. Now all of my boyfriend's relatives are posting vague statuses about me on Facebook.

Am I the asshole?"
1417,crdm6s,"AITA if I take a job over a friend's wedding? One of my friends got engaged 2 years ago and  pretty informally asked me to be in her wedding as a bridesmaid which I happily accepted. Fast forward since then and I started/finished grad school and started my dream career path. I also moved to a different state than her halfway across the country (pertinent information for later). Since her engagement there has been very little talk abut the wedding which is supposed to be this November. I was added to a group chat where the other girls have been sharing dress ideas/bachelorette party ideas but nothing has panned out successfully. 

Two days ago I receive an invitation in the mail for her bridal shower which is next weekend. I texted her mom to let her know that this is super last minute and I won't be able to make it since flights are super expensive. Her mom said she was super disappointed since the bridal party is going to all be there (all but one girl lives in the same town it's taking place in). Then, this morning, I got an insane job offer that will contract me October 26-November 9th. I called my friend to talk because she never locked down a specific date for the wedding in the group and I wanted to see if I could make it work. She flipped out because she decided it was going to be November 2nd and demanded that I have to come because I made a commitment to her and I would ""ruin the entire flow of the wedding and photos"". 

I feel bad because I did tell her I would be there for her on her day but I also think it's pretty disrespectful to not give your wedding guests proper advance notice of when events are going to take place. Flights are expensive and I'm just starting out in my job so I don't have a lot of money to spare, especially if I don't take this assignment. If I had even received a save the date I would have blocked out my calendar 100% and gotten flights months ago. I really am torn because this is a life changing opportunity for me but my friend is pretty pissed. AITA here?"
1418,e56exa,"AITA for wanting my roommate to sleep in his own room? I'll keep this brief: I (23F) and my husband (29M)  were together for almost 5 years before things went south in our marriage and we broke up. We still live together due to the economy being what it is, and are civil, but there's no denying there's some lingering resentment. Still, I'd like for us to remain friends and hopefully someday put the unpleasantness behind us.

He has -always- hated naps and going to bed. Honestly it reminds me of a two year old. He doesn't get enough sleep, and doesn't go to bed at a reasonable time. I brought this up frequently during our relationship, as it was causing problems, but I understand now that we're broken up it isn't my business anymore. He can go to bed whenever he wants. The issue is, because he doesn't get enough rest, he nods off all the time- usually in the living room. Why is this an issue you may ask? Because he snores like a bear yodeling into a garbage disposal. He'll also fall asleep while playing video games or watching movies, which is a waste of electricity, and I would prefer not to have to listen to the media noise if no one is paying any attention to it.

Thus, when he does this, I will wake him up and gently inform him ""Hey, you're falling asleep."". He will wake up for a few moments, them fall asleep again. Around the 4th time I will gently suggest ""You seem tired. Maybe you should go in your room and take a nap."".

All of this not only pisses him off, but the majority of the time he will completely deny he was asleep. Even though he was sitting there slumped over, snoring, drooling, and dropping his controller in the floor. I have to admit it irks me because he's so immature about it, but whatever. I don't want to listen to him snoring, I don't want to have to tiptoe around in the communal area- and if he's just going to nod off, maybe I want to use the damn TV.

So, give it to me reddit: AITA for wanting him to go in his own room when he's falling asleep?"
1419,chtubp,"AITA for telling my future (at the time) mother in - law to pay for her out guest at my wedding Here’s the backstory, my wife’s Parents made a deal with her that they would either pay for her wedding or college if it is out of state but not in state. My wife chose college which sucks for me in the future but oh well haha. My wife went for two years of out of state college which was paid for by her parents and then two years in State College which I am still paying for with student loans because they refused to do it. So when we got married my wife and I had to pay for it and we are both fresh out of college with extremely low paying jobs. We both had friends that we wanted to come and family so of course we’re gonna pay for them to come. Here is where the AITA part comes in. My wife’s mother wanted to invite all of her friends, coworkers and her boss which she just started working for to the wedding and we could not afford it so I told her if she wants them to come she has to pay for them. That started a huge fight that now even 15 years later still comes up from time to time. Just wondering am I the asshole?"
1420,ash45a,"AITA for calling a guy out for being obnoxious and causing a group of friends to become awkward? So, for a bit of context, I'm an English major, but I've educated myself a lot in regards to vegan diet because 1. I'm fascinated with biology and anatomy, 2. I believe you can never have too much knowledge and 3. Because my ex was a vegan and I wanted to be able to cook something that would be nutritious and appropriate for her diet. I'm not claiming to be an expert, but I'm not oblivious either.

&#x200B;

In my year, there's this guy, let's call him Seb. He's tolerable. I have no choice anyway, since we have a lot of mutual friends in our year. From the very beginning though, you knew the guy is vegan (one of those who can't shut up about it). And I'd like to stress, I have absolutely nothing against vegans or vegetarians.

&#x200B;

The situation happened some time ago when me, Seb and couple of other people from uni went out for a couple of beers. The convo goes on as I remembered I had a ham sandwich in my backpack. As soon as I take a bite out of it, he goes ""What are you doing?"". Confused, I answer ""Eating?"" to which he goes ""Would you mind not eating this in front of me?"". 

&#x200B;

To just calm his bitching, I go ""Oooh, okay. Sure"" and get up to sit elsewhere. As I get up, he goes ""I can't believe you can eat that. That's disgusting."" So me, being a smartass that I am, I answer ""Actually, it's quite tasty."". He starts ranting about how I'm eating something that used to be alive and slaughered, how he hasn't eaten meat in three years already, yatta yatta yatta. Tired by his lecture, I just go ""Look, I respect that you don't eat meat, good for you Seb. Could you respect the fact that I don't eat fake meat?""

&#x200B;

He starts yelling that he's not gonna ""respect"" someone eating a murder victim in front of him, that I'm disgusting and how can someone claim to love animals if they eat meat, that humans don't need meat and that's just our barbaric nature to murder and eat the flesh etc. I replied that if I had a week I wouldn't have time to explain how wrong he was, that if he's not replacing the proteins he's not consuming from meat by something else he's killing himself, that if humans weren't omnivores, we wouldn't have fangs to shred meat etc.

&#x200B;

The argument went on for like an hour, to which he, when he ran out of things to yell, just got up and left without word, leaving everyone baffled. Now, any time somebody is offering to hang out, he's asking if the ""murderer"" is gonna be there, and refuses if the answer is yes. People who witnessed it feel I was right in this regard, but the situation in the group has become very awkward. Should I've just kept my trap shut and let him rant to not spoil the evening or did I do the right thing for calling Seb out? I'm confused at this point, cause the aftermath is just tiring at this point.

&#x200B;

Tl;Dr: Called a guy out for being an obnoxious vegan asshole, should I've bitten my tongue and let him rant or was I right for standing up to the wanker in question?"

She broke her leg on a cruise, resulting in eventual termination at her job and has been unemployed, living on disability and her pension since. Our relationship has been a bit strained since she started dating her bf almost 3 years ago and has recently gotten much worse. Due to her job situation and an outright lack of financial responsibility she has found herself in quite a bit of debt and is struggling financially. Right around the time I got married my mom asked me to co-sign a personal loan so she could get back on track..I agreed; then, about a month later I noticed about $300 missing from my savings account. I asked her about it and it was chalked up to a mistake and was told she would take care of it the next day; she did not. Fast forward to today, she has asked me to borrow another $500 to help pay her bills. My husband and I have the money; however it would come from our savings account which is for emergencies and to pay for our honeymoon. Based on my current relationship with my mother, the fact that she never paid me back the $300 she took earlier, and not knowing how she’ll afford to pay us back another $500, I’m hesitant to lend her the money; however, I feel extremely guilty not helping her when she needs it.

1422,einmv0,"AITA for being mad at my boyfriend for playing poker So basically what the title says, I’ve been in a relationship with my boyfriend for a while now. Somewhere in that time he picked up a gambling habit, namely blackjack and poker. I didn’t have a problem with it at first and I would even join in a few games here and there, but I feel like it’s gotten significantly worse and I’ve grown to resent it. It seems like almost every day he’s having friends over for a poker game and in the last few weeks he’s gone to the casino with his friends every couple days. A few weeks ago I talked to him about it, how I was worried about the amount of money being put into it, how I feel like I get put on the backburner when he’s playing, how he’s playing far too much to just be casually playing. I felt like he understood, but he just continues to play both at his house and the casino every. single. day. 

Basically, on New Years Eve he tells me that he’s going to the casino for the New Year and he invites me to go along. I really didn’t want to go, I’m not interested in it at all anymore and I didn’t want to be stuck an hour away from home while he and his friends play poker for hours on end. Plus, he’s already aware of how I feel about casinos and gambling. I declined, and he went to play poker instead. So I guess I’m just mad/disappointed that we didn’t get to spend new years together, but I also had the choice to spend it with him. I don’t know if I’m really justified in being mad and wanted to see what people think. I just wanted to spend the new year with my boyfriend and I felt really neglected, even though I had the option to see him. So, AITA?"

It was $75 and the only backpack I will use and I use it everyday. I absolutely adore it and it’s still in perfect condition. I don’t allow people to use things that are super close to me and my mom knows that. The backpack and the rest of the line including the shoes and clothes were limited edition and aren’t sold anywhere anymore except for buy/sale where they’re $200+ and I don’t have the kind of money for that if something were to happen for it and my mom told me she wouldn’t replace it. She was going into surgery. (Not a big one) and said she needed a change of clothes. Her hospital stay lasted literally only 3 hours and she didn’t use a change of clothes and I told her she wouldn’t need a change of clothes. She’s calling me selfish for not letting her use my backpack even tho it means everything to me. Me and my mom also don’t really get along. I say she’s selfish for not seeing this from my eyes and not asking my brother for a backpack or using a reusable grocery style bag. There’s tons of other options in the house but she wanted my special backpack. And now she won’t talk to me. So AITA?

1424,ejp799,"AITA For Giving a Worker The Exact Amount He Billed? Today I had a guy come to my home to sweep my chimney. When I made the appointment I asked him how much the total would be for an inspection and sweep and he said $149.  I asked him if he accepts cash and he said he did.

So I gave my husband $149 cash in an envelope and asked him to handle the chimney sweeper so I could work in another room. I didn’t rush out to the bank to get exact cash or anything, I just happened to have it on hand.

After the guy left my husband was pretty upset with me and said he felt embarrassed by what I did. He said the guy gave him a look that said “seriously?!?” without actually saying those words when he took the money (a $100 bill, two $20 bills, and 9 $1 bills) and “smirked”. I wasn’t there so did not witness this myself. My husband said we looked like “cheapskates” for not just giving $150 or $160.

I’m confused. Am I supposed to tip a chimney sweep? I honestly didn’t know. I thought the price he quoted was the price I was supposed to pay? Also, if the worker wanted $150 or $160 for his work, why not charge that?

I am very shy and have social anxiety and generally don’t do well communicating with people I don’t know very well. I am also an extremely direct person and have trouble understanding when people beat around the bush and play what I call “social games.” Just say what you want. If you want $150 for your work, tell me that.  I find dealing with people, especially in service setting where you have to negotiate, exhausting. I am always unsure of myself.

My husband pointed that out how I don’t understand social cues, how I should have known that $149 was just what they say because it sounds better than $150 for marketing purposes. I should have known that I needed to give $150 and possibly even tip to not look cheap and avoid bad service. He was also pointing out how this translates to my professional life. I’ve had a hard time with job interviews and office politics in the past and don’t have any of my own friends or close family.

This really hurt my self esteem and really had me questioning myself/my judgement. I also feel bad if I am supposed to tip and didn’t.

AITA for giving the chimney sweep exactly the amount he quoted/billed? Should I have rounded up to $150 for etiquette purposes?

1426,bin3fw,"AITA for hiding my [20F] stuff from my mum? Apologies in advance as I'm on mobile. TL:DR at the end.

So my mum has no sense of boundaries. She's one of those people who's like 'what's mine is yours' and I'm all for sharing but this is getting ridiculous. We're the same size in shoes and clothes so naturally sometimes take things from each other's wardrobe, but not often. But she's taking it too far. I can't have makeup on my dressing table as it'll go missing, and when I find it in her bag she just says 'oh but we always share!' when it's been completely used and I've not had chance to even wear it. She does the same with food - if I buy something nice to eat for later, I'll come back to it and it'll have been eaten or put in the bin without me knowing. 

It's gotten to the point where I have to hide new purchases to stop her from taking them. If I buy a new top or an expensive perfume, it goes missing! I recently bought a gorgeous new pair of shoes for my birthday, and she's already told me two events she wants to wear them to. The final straw was the Easter eggs, and it's pretty petty tbh.

So at Easter we had a few Easter eggs, and we've both been eating them. My boyfriend got me one, and my boyfriends parents bought me a big Easter egg which I was trying to savour as it had some lovely extra chocolates. She ate it. She ate it and didn't tell me, and I'm pissed off ngl. She could have had any one of the other eggs but no, she had to have the one which was a gift. I have to lie to my boyfriend and tell him how good the chocolate was and how I really enjoyed it, when I haven't had it. I kinda feel like enough is enough, it's petty I know, but I'm sick of having to 'share' my belongings when if I take something of hers I get yelled at or told I'm not allowed. She's not my sister, she's my mother, why can't she just have her own things and let me have mine?

I feel like an asshole for having to hide my purchases from her but it's the only way I get to enjoy them.

TL:DR - My mum thinks 'sharing' is the same as taking without permission, and I have to hide my things from her to stop her from using them."

1428,cuf0fm,"AITA for driving like a maniac on my private drive? tl;dr - I have a long, private drive on property that I own and I go fast as shit on it. Nosy neighbor came to complain that I am endangering others for speeding. Told him if he didn't leave i'd call the police on him for trespassing. 



Full story. 
So I live in a rural area on the outskirts of the city because I like peace and quiet. We recently got a new neighbor over a month and a half ago and the houses in this area are spread out quite a bit and our house happens to have a very long driveway/street which is on our land. This being a driveway, it has no speed limit signs posted or anything. Our driveway out here is fairly long though. It runs from the main road about a mile and a half to our house.
Our driveway is also fenced. Once you drive off the main road and go through the gate, you're on our driveway.

Now, because we have our own private road basically, I treat it how I want since it's on our land and isn't governed by the city/state etc. This road has now laws so I speed up and down it as fast I can for shits and giggles. It has a few turns so it's fun to whip my little MX-5 about in when I go to the store, work or really just whenever I am coming and going because I find it fun and its not hurting anyone. 

Well apparently our new neighbor across the street has noticed my ""dangerous"" driving. How? I don't know. You basically need binoculars to see your neighbors house because my drive is a mile and a half long and so is his. He came over one day after I got done speeding home from work, banged on my door and told me that I need to stop speeding and driving so recklessly and told me that I could hit someone and how I am endangering others.

I told him that it's my street, on my property which I own and that it's not a through street that just anyone can use because it's a private drive. I also told him there are no posted speed limit signs and that I had no intentions of ever putting one up and that I can't endanger anyone since no one should be driving down my street to begin with. (and there is a gate that's always closed unless I open it or leave it open) Further more if someone is driving down my street it's usually planed and I know they are coming. Lastly, it's not like I am driving up and the driveway all day every day. Only when I am leaving the house or coming home. 

He lost his shit and I told him he needs to fuck off and I will damn well drive how I want to drive on my driveway. So he threatened to call the city and get one of those mobile police traps setup that records speed. I told him that they can't put that on private property and if he would like, I would be happy to call the police to come over right now and have him arrested for trespassing.

So aita for telling my nosey neighbor to fuck off and mind his own business? (I get I am the asshole for telling him to fuck off and could have been nicer about it)"

For the last year and a half, my maid of honor who we will call Susan has been trying to convince me to have a bachelorette party at a male strip club, or at this club or that club and each time I tell her no, I don’t want it. I feel like Jon Snow talking about the Iron Throne with how many times I’ve told her no. 

Come to find out, her and my other bridesmaids have been planning this big elaborate party for me that’s tonight. I got a text from Susan last night asking to meet her at her house tonight at 8 for some “girl time” but another friend texted me and said they were going to ambush me with a bachelorette party.

Susan spent a lot of money booking and paying for this party, and would probably drop out of my wedding if I don’t go but at no point had I ever hinted that I wanted this. I’ve always outwardly said no.

1430,bwwzkx,"AITA - Please don't spend money for me? I'm conflicted on this one: 

We just had a group of grad students come through from overseas to work with us and observe how we work, they were unpaid but everything inclusive of accomodation and food was covered by their school. We received nothing extra from supervising them on the projects they brought with them and the work that we were doing at the same time. They've been a great help, and at the same time, we've given hours of feedback and walked them through a lot of procedures that are proprietary to us and current in the industry as a whole. They're leaving the placement with many, many valuable skills and work experience that helps put them ahead in the field. 

Last night they invited us out to dinner, indicating that they wanted to treat us, and while we agreed to join them for dinner, we flat out refused to accept thrm paying -to the point where we were constantly reminding each other to keep track of our individual bills.

I had to leave early, so I paid up my drinks and food, which came to about $25 -over the objections of the interns ""I'm not letting you poor students pay, you don't earn anything!"" say my goodbyes and leave. 

Next moring, our overall Project Supervisor came in and said ""As per last night, I need another $35 from everyone to cover the bill for the interns.""

After I left, Supervisor decided that the night was on us, basically. Everyone in the office git out their wallets, and put in their $35. I also did so, but the look on my face must have given it away. 

""Something wrong, Narsfs?""

""Yeah... kind of... I didn't agree to this... I mean, I'll also pay... but er..."" 

Then someone calls out ""Don't be an asshole, we all agreed!""

I mumbled that I wasn't there when this agreement was made. A colleague on the project called me aside later and said I just should have kept quiet, paid up and not say a word, regardless of how I felt.

""Sorry, I calculated it wrong. It's another $10 each.""

1431,9kirt8,"AITA for not loving the fact that my parents decided to remodel my room while I was away and leaving it in a state. So this started about a month and a half ago when I went on holiday with my mate to Budapest. While I was away my parents took it upon themselves to remodel my room (that I pay rent to live in) getting rid of furniture and possessions as they saw fit. 

When I got back all of my stuff was in a storage unit thrown unceremoniously into packing boxes. This includes some vinyl that is A: about as breakable as a 95 year old with osteoporosis, B: pretty rare and hard to replace (one of which got completly buttfucked and is now in more than one piece :).  ) PCI connectors snapped off of my GPU ect ect you get the picture. 

 To add to that I had a 12 hour shift at work 6 hours after I arrived back in England aaaaand they didn't bother putting anything back , so there I am sleep deprived as all human hell after a 7 day festival with 4 hours of sofa sleep to get me through the day. 

My parents have at this point decided that because I'm back that it's my responsibility to finish the work. So cue having to rebuild all of my furniture (the stuff they decided I should keep at least, goodbye to my desk because I spend too much time on my pc). 

I'm realising that this is super rambling but this has continued as me being considered ungrateful for what they see as a nice gesture and while I'm not mad at them for trying to do something g nice for me I just feel as though they didn't consider my needs or wants at all. Even after specifically telling them to please not mess with my room while I'm gone. Like a landlord wouldn't remodel and fuck with someone's stuff while they're away. 

For reference I'm 19m, have a full time decent(ish) job and pay my share of rent and bills as well as paying for my own car and insurance ect (not saying this should warrant me any respect, I just don't want you to think I'm a spoilt shit head).

Tldr: went on holiday. parents decided to play home improvements with my room. Broke some thing i can't replace. Threw some things away I wanted/needed. Didn't consider that I might like to come home to something other than an empty room. And now think I'm being extremely ungrateful, but I'm just stressed as hell and too busy to fix all of the unfixing they've done. 

Let me know if you need more info to judge me.

Reddit, am I the asshole? "
1432,ejvkhv,"AITA For trying to stay out of a business relationship with my girlfriend's parents? My girlfriend and I have been together for 2 and a half years. Her parents are in the financial advising/insurance sales/accounting industry, and GF (in college heading for med school) has been slowly immersed into their fields as well.

GF's parents place of work has a culture of bringing in close friends of employees as clients (being an MLM), and GFs parents have invited me to many of their ""work parties"" which mostly boil down to a sales presentation for non-employee guests. Her parents have attempted to contact my father, a recent retiree, offering to help him with his retirement plan (as an official client). He declined, having already consulted his own FA, and avoided their attempted future contact regarding the matter. GF's father often tries to get me on board with the business, telling me how he could get me an opportunity in the company (despite me having an bachelor's degree in a completely unrelated field). This being my GF's parents, I show passing interest in the subject of the conversation when it arises, but otherwise decline any further involvement. I've made GF aware on many, many occasions as to my apprehension regarding her family pushing both her and I into their business, but she doesn't see the fault, and is willingly ramping up into higher positions within the organization by taking license tests and other similar preparation.

As of late, GF's mother has been making pushes to give me ""advice"" on savings or investment strategies. My understanding of their company is their main profits are made not by selling the advising services, but that the income is from commissions and referrals to external companies. The idea of being a customer of GF's parents' financial management business is something I am very hesitant to approach, lest some business disagreement affect their perception of me as their daughter's partner. GF says she thinks my first impression of the business is ""not very good"", and that I'm assuming the worst in not giving it a chance. She says she's asking for ""a little trust"" and says that it hurts that I won't even consider it. Before this, I had thought that doing business with your in-laws was something to be avoided, something that would potentially stress the personal and familial relationship, and that this was a common notion. During the long conversation I repeatedly asserted this as just being something I'm not comfortable with, and felt it was unfair that she was insisting on questioning my boundaries rather than respecting them. I really do value her opinion very much, however, and I'm very unsure as to the validity of my opinions at this point. I'm torn between asserting my personal ideologies and not wanting her to think I don't trust her family. I should mention that both she and her family are great people otherwise who I really get along with, and have no other qualms with.

Am I the asshole for trying to keep GF's family business at an arm's length, and am I the asshole for wanting her to respect my boundaries?

EDIT: An important point I should mention is that **she's stated that saying no is okay,** but whenever the topic comes up in conversation it goes much as described above. Not sure how to handle that."
1433,bauju1,"AITA for telling my friend that her former ‘stalker’ still has an obsession with her? 
My friend was recently the victim of a ‘stalking’ situation (it turns out that he wasn’t stalking her, but being overall very creepy and clingy with her) and they stopped being friends sometime in January.

The dude that was ‘stalking’ her is in my class. He’s my lab partner, and while I don’t talk to him unless I have to, we do talk occasionally.

He keeps talking about her. This ended like three months ago and he still talks about how every time he listens to music he thinks of her. He also said that he was going to try to match classes with her so that they can talk and they can try being friends again.

I told my friend about it as a precaution. Just letting her know that he still obsesses over her and that he was trying to match classes with her and join the clubs that she’s in.

She didnt take it too well (understandably) and last week she went to the social worker about it. I had the text messages and they called me down to show them.

I guess she told them because they called me
Her mom said that the situation (him following her around, trying to find out where she lived, learning her schedule) and her decision not to be friends with him anymore based on that was my fault. She told my friend that I don’t want her to date other people (he had a crush on her), that I don’t like it when she talks to other people and that I don’t like the fact that she has other friends. That I’m manipulative and that I made everything happen and escalated it myself.

I’m confused because I didn’t *do* anything. I’ve never done anything to make her mom think that and my friend said that what she said isn’t the case.

Now I’m confused. AITA? Should I not have said anything? Was I wrong for telling my friend ? I really hadn’t meant to start anything and this isn’t a post for ‘validation’. I am genuinely confused and I’m hoping someone can point out what I did wrong, or didn’t do wrong."
1434,e8i2t8,"WIBTA if we didn't invite step mom or children to our wedding? Here's the info:

Fiance's dad cheated on his mom with a woman at their Church (dad was the pastor, was asked to step down since the news got out). He has yet to actually apologize for ruining a family dynamic, but has worked on rebuilding the relationship with my fiance. My fiance and I got engaged November 2018 and then less than a month later, his dad proposed to his woman (the same woman he had the affair with) and they got married in July 2019. We both felt a bit offended that he couldn't wait and basically stole my fiance's thunder because we obviously plan on forever and neither of them were able to make it work with their previous partners. And it was out of the blue. Fiance's mom has not been dealing with the divorce very well and we're a bit worried about her feelings for who's invited to the wedding as well as my fiance's feelings. 

I should note that we've spent time with step mom and her kids but still have some stuff to work through and talk about. The step mom has tried talking to me about wedding stuff and is genuinely really nice but it's just so hard to get past she also cheated on her husband with fiance's dad so it's all around not great. Her daughter is a senior in high school (will be in college by the wedding) and her son is younger but I think still high school age. He has autism I believe and is definitely very vocal but doesn't typically make too much sense. During their wedding in July, he got up and started shouting (not angry) and moving toward them so it interrupted a bit. We haven't really bonded or done much other than sit at the same table with the kids. 

So I have two questions if that's allowed!

1435,chp8sx,"WIBTA if I let my ex-roommates lose utilities Hi.

My old roommates made life awful for reasons I won’t get into for anonymity. I never want to see them again in my life.

I pay the utilities for the apartment. My roommates PayPal me their share of utilities every month. We each separately pay rent to our landlord.

My lease ends very soon. I am leaving the apartment, and they are renewing their lease. I told them a few months ago that I will be cancelling the utilities so they can create their own account for the next year, and it won’t be attached to me. They agreed. 

They have subletters living in their rooms for the summer (college town). 

I warned my roommates two weeks ago that I had set the utilities to cancel in two weeks, and that they would need to set the utilities back up in order to not lose power/water/etc. I sent them information on how to transfer some of the utilities to their name so they wouldn’t need to get new equipment, and I cancelled the rest. 

I just got an email that they never transferred cable or wifi into their name. I assume this means that they also didn’t start up the other utilities, that need to be set up or else the subletters will lose electricity/water/gas/WiFi/cable.

These people were such assholes to me that I don’t want to warn them to set up their utilities because it’s not my problem, and they’re adults who can handle this simple stuff. The only problem is that I’m still responsible for the cable and WiFi bills, which I plan to suspend when my lease ends if they haven’t transferred billing to themselves yet. 

When I told my friends I was doing this, they told me I was being an asshole for not reminding them (even though I reminded them in the past) and that it isn’t fair to the subletters. But... these aren’t my subletters, it’s not my apartment anymore. AITA?"
1436,cjtg3x,"AITA For threatening a new mother for ripping off my fiance? Ok, this is my second time posting here. And on this one, I feel bad.

Backstory. Five years ago, my fiance ordered a partial fursuit from a woman. I will call her Fursuit maker.  
The total cost of the suit was to be $650.00. My fiance agreed. Fursuitmaker and my fiance agreed to payments, monthly. She was so excited about it, and I was excited for her. The suit was not to be delivered until my fiance finished payments. (Side note, this includes character rights.)  
My fiance finished her payments, and Fursuit maker agreed to ship it. We waited almost two years, keeping in touch and asking. Fursuit maker made a number of excuses during this time. The one of note is that after my fiance bugged her enough to send it, she stated that she tried to and they (USPS) tried to charge her an extra $50 because, according to her, she was being a bitch, so they charged her extra, and she could not pay it.  
We took her at her word and paid her another $50. - This sounds really dumb now that I am typing it out.

Anyway, fast forward to the beginning of 2018, and we got the suit. (Her friend had to send it for her)  
We got it, it was all wrong. We live-streamed the unboxing, and made a secondary video showing all the flaws. That, in and of itself is a long story.  
After some convincing from her friends, Fursuit maker started paying us back. We even agreed on a monthly payment plan. This did not go exactly well. Another long story, and not my question here as to am I the asshole.

During this time, she got pregnant and had a child.  
Finally, I had enough.  
I sent her a threat through facebook messenger. 

>""Hi Firsuit maker. I am 'my fiances' fiance.  
You have given her the run around for long enough. You have owed her $210.00 since November 2018. You come up with excuse after excuse, then you ghost her when you don't have any excuses left.  
You have driven her to the point of tears, so now I am taking this out of her hands.  
She was kind to you, I approved her being kind to you. You took advantage of our kindness.  
You have 11 (eleven) days to pay 'my fiance' the $210.00 IN FULL, or I am posting a beware on every facebook beware group that I can find, I am posting it on Reddit, I am posting it on Twitter (1,127 followers will enjoy this), and I am asking a few friends to do the same.  
EDIT: Oh, and here too. :) -link to site removed- (I am considering 4chan as well.)  
I have ALL needed screenshots and TWO videos (a live stream, and a followup video which shows every little mistake in the suit in full detail) organized and ready to launch.  
11 days 'Firsuit maker'.  
This is both a threat and a promise. You do not rip off the woman I love. I will put you on BLAST!""

This worked. She agreed to pay in the ensuing conversation.  
To be clear; I will not put out a beware on her, for the sake of her child.

1437,epato6,"AITA for staying with my Mom? Alt account for obvious reasons

So when I (15m) was about 8 or 9, my parents divorced and it was quite messy and my mom and dad don't like each other which is an understatement.

Scheduling wise it's split 50/50

My Dad has custody Wednesday-saturday/Sunday

My mom picks up on Saturday one week and Sunday the next and so on

This week we had a half day which my dad did not know about ( I think he knew he just wanted to cause trouble, relevant later)

Usually after school I ride the bus to my grandma's house and since it was a half day I went back to my mom's house and my dad was supposed to pick me up at 4

Since my dad assumed I was at my grandma's he texted me and said he'd pick up at 5:30

His punctuality is really bad and he is constantly late so about a year ago my mom kept me for my dad's custody time because he was more than and hour late

After that he was seldom late

Well today he was an hour late and my mom texted my dad saying she would be keeping us and my dad threw a fit

He sat in my mom's driveway for 30 minutes, called me 8 times and ordered me to come to the car and go with him. I refused

He even texted a group chat with myself, my sister, and him saying there would be reporcussions because we didn't go with him

Sorry for the long post but here's where I might be the AH

My dad's house is in the middle of butt fuck nowhere and it is so incredibly mind numbingly boring that I hate being at his house. Quite honestly, if there were more to do(the internet is 1mbps and I live 30+ minutes from any of my friends) I would have gone with my dad to not cause any problems

When my friends find out, I suddenly become the rich friend. I never volunteer the information because I'm suddenly treated differently. They start calling me the boujie one. When I don't like something, they say ""it must not be good enough for you"". 

I've always struggled with this, because obviously it feels backwards to be upset about being wealthy, but it really makes me feel ostracized.

1439,aa6vne,"AITA visited my sister and her family. Left in the night while all were sleeping. I have been visiting my sister and her family the last couple of days. I had a ticket to return home on Friday evening (today/tomorrow). 
My sisters husbands brothers family came to visit yesterday (not planned, the brothers thought it would be a great idea). They were 4, two parents, one baby and the mothers sister. 

We were already 4, my sister and her husband, their baby and me. 

They live in a 2 bedroom apartment, that barely fit us 4 that was originally sleeping there. 

Somehow it got decided that the brothers family would sleepover instead of driving 30 min back, no alcohol was involved. 

**I had to pack my stuff and leave the room I slept in** and sleep in the living room due to that their child needed the room. The brother also slept in the living room, and he was **snoring** like there is no tomorrow. 

The mother, her sister and the baby had to sleep with the **lights on** (fully on, in my “old” room). Which of course made it harder to sleep and on top of that the baby was **crying all night.** 
They had to have the door open 3-4 inches so the light and baby’s crying passed out. 
I need to underline that this was the brothers baby and it’s mother and aunt in “my old room”. 

I got pissed because:

-	It was impossible to sleep due to snoring, baby crying and lights on. 
-	Since I had to sleep in the living room instead of my room I had to stay up until everyone was ready to go to sleep although I was tired and wanted to sleep 2-3h earlier. Went to bed 2am. 
-	The visit of the brother could have been postponed 1 day, there was no room for all of us and it wasn’t planned. 1 day later would work for everybody and I  would be gone

So I bought a new ticket home, and left in the middle of the night. 
I’ve tried to really not limit them with during my visit, they have been able to do whatever they want when I’ve been there. I’ve paid for my food etc since I thought it would be better for them to spend the money on their baby instead. 

Somehow I felt really screwed over because of the visit of the brother and how they handled the situation. 


**Edit: Let me add that the purpose of the brothers family’s visit was also to sleepover. The brother is too lazy to drive back.**

Tl;dr: visited my sister, her husbands brothers family came over although there was no room and I couldn’t sleep. Left in the middle of the night instead of later that day.  "
1440,cpb255,"AITA for trying to make amends with frenemies? So this happened a few weeks back, I was visiting my hometown and I went out with my homegirls.

So to keep thing short(er), we were at this bar and my highschool nemesis started talking with my friend. Since I was there I started small talk and just being nice imo.

Well, my friend went to the bathroom and this girl, let’s call her Sarah, comes again, this time I’m alone, and she’s standing next to me, ordering her drink, which is same as mine.

I said something in the lines “oh you’ve got taste, cheers”.

Next thing you know she starts saying she doesn’t need to be talking to a bitch and that I’m the lowest life form for pretending to be nice.

I’m like, mate, I’m just tryna be nice, highschool was 5 years ago and I’m a grown up, I don’t really care what happened between us, if it means anything I’m sorry.

So a little backstory, about why she is my nemesis. Basically, she and her group of friends had this anonymous hate and gossip blog and frequently wrote shit about me and my friends. (They didn’t hide it was them, it was anon to hide the fact from the teachers.)

Well, my friends and I decided a revenge would be a good idea and when her friend group had somekind of art exibhition (don’t know how to spell that, english is not my first), we basically trashed it to put it nicely. I know I was the asshole then as much as they were, that’s not even questionable.

Back to the main event, she starts shaking and throwing a tantrum about how I ruined highschool for her, her friends chim in and start bashing me for being a bitch and to grow up??

In the meantime my friend came back and looked confused as to wth is happening. I asked her if we could leave and so we did.

I jokingly told her to “shush” and she told me to never say that to her and asked if I had somewhere to be/to leave. 

I took this as “gtfo, she doesn’t want you here” and started getting dressed to leave. She then got super weird saying how nobody has ever left her in the middle of the night. I tried explaining that this was probably a miscommunication (I’m tired and tipsy) and she told me it was beyond repair.

1442,be37mi,"AITA for not wanting to forgive my mom? Ever since dad moved out, mom has been very busy with her work life and such and, because of that, hasn't had much time to bond with me and my sister. She'd also be constantly stressed and would lash out for minor things, getting to the point of saying very hurtful stuff. Some examples that come to mind are ""If you're so unhappy here, I think you should go live with your dad (who lived 6 hours away)"", her continuously telling me I shouldn't like so-and-so because that's a boy thing, her saying how fat people can't be happy. One day I walked up to her to talk about how much I liked'The Hobbit' and, well, I did get a bit too excited. She looked at me and said, ""You know no one will like you if you're like that, right?"", in regards to me wanting to tell her about all the smallest things I'd liked in the book.

10 years have gone by and, sure, our relationship is much better nowadays, if only because I spend all my time holed up in my room and just avoid talking to her in general. Recently, though, things started going sour.

I was too stressed out one night and ended up confronting her about all this, and I've always put the blame for all our issues on me because I couldn't bear the thought of being even more of a bother to my mom. Either way, we talk for a while, she cries, I cry, but I feel deep down that she isn't really paying attention to what *I* have to say. She dismissed all my comments about the hurtful things she said, claiming ""that's not what she meant"" and ""she's sorry I feel like that"", but never owning up to what she did or said to me. However, I hoped we could finally work this out and put the past behind us. Imagine my surprise when literally nothing changed and she remained distant and overall uninvolved in my personal life.

But then things escalated yesterday and a friend of hers that had moved away but showed up here like a month ago just *had* to step in. I didn't like having him and his wife around already, but I'd just keep to my room until they left and it would be ok, but interfering with me and my mom's personal affairs is a whole different matter.

And guess what happened after her friend said ""we should do more family stuff together""? They tricked me into going out with them today. I was already pissed off at being dragged away from home to take the friend's wife to the clothing store, but then my mom showed up with her friend and my sister and I just felt my heart wrench. I felt betrayed. Why couldn't she be straightforward about it? And most of all, why did she only start trying to fix our relationship after her friend stepped in? Was her daughter's distress not enough for her to care? Did she need to listen a second opinion?

I'm just so done. I spent these 10 years trying my best not to hurt her feelings or lash out at her even though I was going through some hard times, and of course she doesn't even know about that because I thought it wasn't worth bothering her over this stuff. Am I in the wrong here?"
1443,d3cih2,"AITA For not responding to My kids deadbeat dad's gf? I was married to a guy who had a son from a previous relationship. We have 2 daughters together. He didn't see his son for many years because he said the mother ""wouldn't let him."" I eventually found out that wasn't the case, and that he got into an argument with the mother and instead of dealing with it, he just stopped talking to her. He never took initiative to deal with anything himself, he always had to be told to take care of his responsibilities.
We split up when the girls were 9 and 5. After he left, about 2 months went by of no contact from him, so I reached out for him to see the girls. A year goes by of random visits. Then one day, they get back from their visit and my 10yo tells me that she has a headache and doesn't feel well because her dad smokes too much cigarettes in his house and the smoke makes her sick. I say I will talk to him about it, but she says she doesn't want me to say anything to him because she doesn'twant to hurt his feelings. The next week, she says she doesn't want to go with him. So I tell him they're not going with him that week. 
That was 4 years ago, and that was the last time I heard from him. He has not once tried to visit them or ask about them. The girls just kind of forgot about him along the way. About two years ago, he had another child with someone else. He apparently told this woman that I ""won't let him see the girls.""
I am not opposed to my daughters spending time with him, if that's what they want, but I refuse to take it upon myself to reach out to him yet again to set it up for him. He skates through life without a care in the world while everyone else in his life does all the hard work for him. 
A few months ago (a week before Father's Day), his new gf messages me to ask if ""we could talk."" I have no problems with this woman, as I've never met her. But I ignored her message because I know exactly what she wants. She most likely wanted to make contact with the girls, to try to surprise him with some grand gesture for Father's Day, by getting all his long lost kids together. I get where she is coming from, but I feel like it is not her responsibility, nor is it any of her business, to try to contact my children for him. If he ever decided to pull his head out and actually ask for himself to see his kids, then that is a different story. 
Am I the asshole here? I get that the kids are the ones that are kind of caught in the middle of all of this, but my kids are doing just fine right now, with or without him.

1445,awcgbn,"AITA for blaming my parents for my academic struggles? Hi, so first of all this is my first-ever Reddit post. Hope I'm doing this right.

&#x200B;

So I was ""homeschooled."" My older siblings got much more attention than I did because they're 7+ years older than me and grouped together, my parents were younger and more patient.

&#x200B;

I was never taught how to do more than very basic division and to this day am very bad at multiplication. Now, I do think I may be ADD or some other type of attention disorder because I can't find myself able to focus on anything for long, including things I enjoy. I tried a pre-algebra class between college and ""highschool"" but found myself staying up until 2 am nearly every night, often in tears because I was tired or frustrated. My dad tried to help me a few times but would yell in frustration when I couldn't wrap my head around something.

&#x200B;

I also had to teach myself to spell and was never properly taught handwriting. My mother would get frustrated with me being distracted or unwilling and gave up after just a few times as I remember it. I learned to spell because I wrote creatively online around age 11 and still do to this day, a decade later, and to this day my handwriting looks very childish and squashed, though I'm trying to fix that. Most of the time I was taught with those comprehensive curriculum books you see at Sam's Club.

&#x200B;

I did try to fill in the gaps of my education a few times, but got frustrated or bored and ended up quitting. My parents really gave up on my education when I was about eight years old after many, many threats of sending me to public school and telling me I'd be a failure in life if I didn't learn. These days if I bring up my failed elementary education my parents simply tell me, ""you were too stubborn."" Now could I have done more? Yeah. At the same time I feel like it would have been a pretty big thing for someone with only basic math under her belt to somehow learn the basics of algebra without any real life human to help. I'm doing pretty ok right now in my college algebra class but I think that's because I'm too tired to be anxious and my teacher is great. I'm good in other classes though.

&#x200B;

Now on my parent's side, we're religious folks. I've got no qualms with my religion at all, but it was part of why they started homeschooling us, and also because I guess my oldest sister had a bad experience with public school when she was little? It's been years since I've heard the reasoning, but my mom likes to boast about how smart homeschooled kids are. All of my older siblings got into an incredibly exclusive college and I did too (but got kicked out over failing math), though I suspect it was based off their success and not my own.

&#x200B;

TLDR: parents decide to homeschool bc of religion and control over material, teach siblings but get tired by the time they need to teach me but never put me in school, and I struggle academically now bc of it."
1446,dr7ioo,"AITA for giving my grandmother one of my elaborate artworks on her deathbed? Hello Redditors, 

My grandmother died last Thursday in the hospital after a year-long battle with cancer. The doctors could sense that the was near, so my immediate family all rushed to be by her side during her last moments. 

For a couple of weeks, I had been working on an elaborately decorated Chinese thread book for my grandma that took about 25 hours to complete. I was planning on giving it to my grandmother on Christmas, but tragically, her disease took a turn for the worse very quickly and that was not to be. The cover of the project consisted of an intricate collage with my grandma's name handwritten in calligraphy. The inside of the book contained a number of collapsable boxes with pictures of our family at the bottom of the boxes. My grandma had difficulty speaking due to the progression of her illness, but I could tell that she greatly cherished the present, and she whispered that she wanted to be buried with it.  

The hours after my grandmother passed were an emotional blur, and I don't remember much. But as we were driving home from the hospital, my sister (who I have a strained relationship with) yelled at me that she thought that it was disgusting to show off my artwork when my grandma was dying. She said that as usual, I was trying to push all of the praise and attention on myself instead of focusing on what really matters. My sister is quite a cantankerous individual, and is pretty resentful because my parents prefer my company over hers. I just stayed silent because arguing with my sister is like trying to negotiate with a time bomb. 

While I can definitely see how my actions could be perceived as showing off, I am not so sure. So Reddit, AITA?"
1447,eaqwdc,"WIBTA if I told my mom she needs to get a job? So context: I'm a college student living with my parents. In my culture, it's expected of me to live at home until marriage, which usually means late 20s, and it would be considered by everyone as weird/stupid/ungrateful if I moved out.

As a student, both of my parents have been extremely clear that my main focus should be on school and nothing else. I have thought about/proposed getting a job in the past only for them to shut me down. My mom goes further than my dad, and has refused to even let me get a summer job when I dont have classes. The only work I've been allowed to do is occasional commissions for my dad's business. 

My dad runs a very small business, which is our only source of income. My mom has not worked in over a decade. We made due then, but cant now.

Recently, my dad lost a major client at his business. It was all fine, then we unexpectedly lost a few *thousand* a month. This is coupled with the cost of living in our area increasing exponentially over the past few years. 

Financially we're in a very bad place. My mom sits at home doing nothing most days. Originally, when she stopped working it was to pursue a passion of hers. Since then it's like she has lost all of her motivation. She cleans around the house, but that's all she actually does. Otherwise, she sits on facebook or binge watches soap operas, or calls her mother and sister on skype for hours every day. 

I think she's depressed, and I have begged and pleaded for her to go see a therapist, but she refuses. She says she never will, and I know it partly stems from trauma in her past (my parents went through hell. My dad worked to move forward and recover, hes only gotten better over time. My mom has bottled everything up and tells herself that other people have it worse now, so she should be happy. It's unhealthy and she tends to blow up at the nearest person when it gets too much for her.)

She is isolating herself from the people around her and cutting friends off left and right. Even after she stopped working, she had some kind of routine and she still had something she wanted to pursue in life, but not anymore.

At the end of the day, I cant force her to work, but we need the extra money. I want to tell her that either she needs to get a job, or I will. I have work study options at my school, as well as plenty of other options. If either of us can get even a small, part time job it would help so much. The problem here is that I know she'd never let me work. She would literally do *everything* in her power to stop me from getting a job now. Unless she suddenly changes her mind, it would be me basically telling her she needs to get a job. I am willing to work, but I feel like knowing this outcome makes me question manipulative somehow, and I dont like that.

I'll probably wait until after the holidays to talk to her, we're stressed enough now as it is, but I'm still wondering, WIBTA if I told my mom that we're broke, and one of us absolutely needs to get a job?"
1448,dejuqz,"AITA for talking to my boss about a coworker? Alright stick with me guys, the title doesn’t really describe the whole thing of course. Using a throwaway account since some buddies use Reddit. 

So I work for a company that takes care of ponds, lakes, wetlands, etc. Our company takes environmental responsibility very seriously, so what happened this morning really threw me for a loop. 

My buddy (J) and a new trainee (C) were walking to the wooded site behind our warehouse with a gas can. I asked what they were doing, and J said they were dumping out gas. I think he saw the look on my face, and started saying that ‘it was almost empty, it’s bad gas’ and so on. Then he said that he was told to do this. 

So I talk to my boss about it, who had no idea about it at all. He told J and C to dump the gas into someone else’s gas can to be used later, not to dump it behind the warehouse. 

I’m not sure exactly what happened, but I’m sure the boss got onto them pretty hard. When we were leaving for the day, I gave a heads up to J that I talked to the boss. He of course wasn’t thrilled, and now he (and I’m guessing C) are mad at me. 

J has worked here for as long as I have, and knows how strict the dumping rules are here. Not to mention that you just don’t dump gasoline anywhere. 

AITA? Should I have just kept my mouth shut and ignored it?"
1449,c6u4zu,"AITA For telling my mom that I'd move out unless she stopped fostering dogs. As long as I can remember, I've had dogs around the house as my mom is an avid dog lover. We have our own little dog and I love him, he's absolutely great and it's really enjoyable having him around the house. In addition to him, my mom has been fostering other dogs for a few years now. 

About a year ago we got a disabled little 3 legged dog. He's an absolute fucking asshole. He has no problem with my mom and her boyfriend as he spends the whole day with them, but he's an absolute dick to everyone else. I try to pet him and give him treats because I know he's had a tough life and I do feel sorry for the little guy. But he's always been a dick to me, he constantly barks at me and has tried many many times to bite me when he sees me go near my mom (he's very defensive of her). It's at the point where I can barely even give her a hug or a kiss on the check because he freaks the fuck out. Not only that, but every time I bring a friend over, he attacks them as well because he's afraid of strangers. Somehow I've been able to put up with this for the last year, but today I came home on my lunch break and him and a new foster dog immediately ran at me and tried to bite me when I went in to say hello to my mom. This was the last straw. 

I told my mom that the fosters had to go. I've voiced my displeasure several times and each time she said she's going to find a home for then, but this time I was serious them leaving. I understand that it's not always easy to find dogs a suitable home and I know that my mom has been trying to get this three legged guy a home for a while now, but I just can't stand it anymore. I told her that if she didn't get rid of them within the next month that I'd start exclusively living with my dad (my parents are divorced and I'm going to be a high school senior). She was pissed when I said this and told me that I had no right to speak to her this way and that she couldn't find the three legged guy a home, but would not take him to the pound. I told her that it might just be worth it to have him euthanized if absolutely nobody would take him. She was having none of that and that's where the conversation has ended for now. I talked to a few friends and some feel for me, while a couple others are convinced that I'm the asshole for threatening to not live with my mom, especially because I know how much it means to her to have me around. I don't actually want to move exclusively into my dad's house, but I really can't take it anymore. It's gotten to the point where I either don't want to go inside my mom's house and if I do go on, I don't even want to talk to my mom because this dog will be there barking at me and trying to bite me. 

So, am I being an asshole? Do I need to just try to earn the affection of this dog? I'm really not sure what to do right now."
1450,dh552v,"AITA for asking my roommate to still contribute to bills. So I moved in with two girls I met on [flatmates.com](https://flatmates.com) at the start of the year for a one year lease. They seemed pretty chill and down to earth and i got on well with them. I have however had bad experiences with roommates before so i specifically remember asking that if someone moved out the bills and rent would still be looked after and they both ecstatically agreed. Now around July one of them (R1) started spending more and more time at her boyfriends to the point we barely saw her. Mid last month R1 told us that she had decided to move in with him and this is where the trouble began. She agreed to continue to pay rent until the end of our lease as she should. But now our quarterly bills (electricity, water, internet) are coming through and she has messaged my other roommate (R2) (who then had to tell me) that she doesn't feel like she should be contributing as she hasn't used anything (not true as she has used the washing machine and lights etc. as she was moving stuff). I messaged back calmly explaining that while its not fair that she has to pay for minimal use, its even more unfair that we would have to suffer the consequences of her decision. R2 and I are happy to discuss reduced rates for fairness but don't believe it right she pays nothing at all.  I also explained that I thought it was a little disrespectful that she not contact me as well as the situation will effect me. So AITA for insisting that R2 makes a reduced contribution for our split bills?

Edit: I should clarify that the room isn't completely empty or cleaned at this point which doesn't allow us to sublet. We aren't asking full price but a reduced amount to help us out as we thought it would always be split 3 ways."
1451,e9xc3n,"WIBTA if I told my aunt her husband was cheating on her? Ok so this is a throwaway acc. I doubt any of my family uses Reddit but just Incase.
A little background: my uncle (35) is the second oldest of three siblings. My dad (47) being the oldest. My dad came to America in his twenties and much later brought my uncle because my uncle wanted to come live here. We come from a communist country so yeah. 

My uncle has had at least 3 wives and has cheated on all of them. Every single one, including the one who gave birth to his son.  Fast forward to 2016 ish. He’s married but he’s coming to America. His new wife (33) wasn’t given a visa yet so she couldn’t come at the same time. It took her about a year to get the visa to come. Within that year where my uncle was alone he began a series of affairs that honestly I wish I was kidding. All while He would send emails to his wife saying that he missed her etc. 

Everyone in the family knew this. Every single person and said nothing because as my mom says “it’s not our business”. To be honest I almost sent my aunt an email spilling everything to her but I was stopped from doing so by my mom and my own fear. 

When my aunt came to America, he apparently stopped. He started being faithful and coming home on time etc. Until about two weeks ago. He keeps asking for my grandad to cover for him and tell my aunt he’s working late and has been spotted with multiple girls. My aunt is literally one of the sweetest ppl I know and she basically loves my uncle with her whole heart. She left her entire country and everything she knows to be with him in America. It would break her heart but still. She deserves better

So WIBTA for telling my aunt that my uncle is cheating on her and has been cheating on her for the majority of their marriage?"

I went over to visit on my birthday, and was met with my sister undressing our youngest sister (4) by pulling down her pants and underwear in front of the family. She continued to do this, in front of the family, and I couldn't stand it. I find that behavior disgusting. She was doing it because she thinks it's funny to  show our little sister naked to the rest of the family.

1453,cmrdmb,"AITA for not gently reminding my cousin why I got the inheritance I did? Throwaway:

My (29f) g-parents had 3 kids, my dad was the middle child he passed away when I was 19. I am an only child, there are 6 g-children total. My g-pa died around 2 years ago. My g-ma died around 4 years ago. In the final Will it was stipulated, each g-child gets a set amount, and each child gets a set amount. In this Will, it also states that if their child predeceased them, then their share goes to any children they have. (So I got my share, plus my fathers).

This is not a small amount, but I'm not multimillionaire either. Of the other g-children, I'm considered the ""least successful"" in that I have my associate’s degree and work as a legal assistant. I have a dog, and live independently in an apartment near my job. My other cousins all are very wealthy, with advanced degrees and multiple kids each. I have 1 cousin though, who is successful but lives way beyond his means, and mooches off his parents (my dad's sister & husband) when bill collectors come around. I will 100% admit, he had a rough life, his father left when he was a kid, and his mom remarried a lot and my g-parents basically raised him. So it all came as a shock to him, when he only received the amount of us ""other"" cousins. So much so, that he tried to contest the Will. it took a year and at least 1/3 of his inheritance only for him to be disappointed in the end.

After talking it over with my Mom, and my boss, I've decided to take a leave of absence from work, (I've been there about 5 years, and have a very close relationship with my boss). I'm taking this time to do some travelling, and physically work on myself (losing that pesky 30 lbs that haunts me). Me and THAT cousin live in the same area of town, and go to the same gym. Always have gotten along, but he loves to make those snide comments, I started avoiding him about a year or so ago, but now that I have more free time, I have run into him a few times. He finally approached me with a ""Why are you here during the day??"" I told him that I am between jobs now (instead of admitting I left voluntarily) And once again got a ""Must be nice with all that money lying around"" After 2 years of hearing these comments, I'll admit I finally kind of snapped. Replied: ""Well, lets just remember how I got this money, wanna trade your mom's life for it?"" I'll admit it was a low blow, but at the same time, I only have this money because my father is DEAD. Just because he feels entitled to my grandparents money, doesn't give him the right to constantly remind me that I got a large share of it, I had to pay my own price for it. Anyways, he told me to ""fuck off"" and stormed away. I have not seen him since. When I told my mother, she was quite angry with me, reminding me his own father abandoned him. I still don't think I did anything wrong, but maybe I did...AITA?

1454,cpk4xm,"AITA for leaving the surprise birthday party my wife threw for me a little early to fulfill a promise to a friend? My wife and I have been married for 2 years. I turned 30 last Thursday. On Friday my wife threw threw me a big surprise birthday party at our house. I was completely shocked. She invited 30-35 of our mutual friends, decorated our whole house, cooked food for the event (and catered some), organized games and even got a friend to act a a DJ. The party was a lot of fun and I appreciated all the effort she put into it. I arrived at the party at around 8:00 and by 12:00 most people had left but there were still a few people there hanging around. She and her 2 sisters were starting to clean up

The thing is I have a good friend who owns a night club. That Friday was the opening day of the club and I had promised him I would make an appearance to show support.  I had mentioned this to my wife in the past but she doesn't know this guy very well an I guess didn't take it that seriously. I had also asked my wife if we had any plans that Friday and she would just say she wanted to go watch a movie, so I figured we could watch the movie and I could still go to the night club with no issue. Well alas, this surprise party happened and although I truly appreciated it, I didn't want to break the promise to my friend so at around 11:45 when the party had winded down I decided to leave to go to the club to fulfill my promise. My wife didn't make a huge deal about it at the time although I could tell she was annoyed.

However the next day she was obviously angry about it and told me she thought it was rude to just leave a birthday party she put so much effort into to go to a club and I made it seem like I didn't care. I again emphasized how appreciative I was of the party but this is something I had promised the guy but she doesn't seem to understand and says I could go to the club ""any day"" and thought was an asshole for just leeaving guests and her sisters there to clean.

Some of our mutual friends are saying the same thing and think it was weird that I just left. I think everyone is being ridiculous. I didn't know about the birthday party when I promised my friend I would show up and I just didn't want to break a promise.

AITA here?"
1455,d0ve4x,"AITA for suggesting my coworker buy me an instantpot if he thinks I should have one so badly? So I work at a small local business, part time during the school year, full time during the summer. This last summer I saved up to buy a car outright instead of making payments, and now I'm back in school so my hours are half of what they used to be. Between rent, food and trying to add to my savings again so I don't have to entirely put repairs on my credit card if I need them, I'm on a pretty strict budget. 

I talk about cooking a lot with one coworker and almost everytime I do one guy, John butts in that I should get an instant pot. And everytime I tell him I can't afford one right now and I like the stuff I have (crockpot, nice pots and pans set, grill) this has been going on since around Easter. 

So yesterday I'm talking to the other coworker trying to figure out how to do a pressure cooker recipe in a slow cooker and John says I wouldn't have this problem if I had an instantpot. I get fed up and turn around and say:

""Oh thank you so much for offering to buy me one! Especially since I've mentioned several time times that I CANT AFFORD IT. That's so sweet of you! Now don't get me anything too fancy.""

He looked at me like I poisoned his coffee and then looked at my boss that was in earshot who just asked him what he expected. 

John then said I didn't have to be a bitch about it and our boss said he could either shut up or go home unpaid. 

I told my mom about all this later and she said I was out of line and could have just asked him not to for the 80th time. 

So AITA?"
1456,e0vza7,"AITA for going low contact with my extended family? Background: I (32/F) will say right off the bat that I have a very complicated relationship with my mother. I love her, but we are very different people from very different times. I had a somewhat challenging childhood, as she suffers from mental illness, and I've been through therapy to be able to process that time in my life. She is medicated now and much calmer, but the damage has been done, and I will never be able to have the type of warm and fuzzy mom and daughter relationship that she wishes we would have. 

Since my adolescent years, she has been on an information diet about my life. I speak with her and my father for quick phone calls on weekends and probably see them every two months or so, even though they only live 45 minutes away. I get very anxious leaving up to any gathering with them, and this is what I am comfortable with. 

My mother has two sisters and her own divorced parents, who are challenging people, at best. Alcoholism, mental illness, extreme narcissistic tendencies and general cattiness and gossipyness run rampant. They all live about 2 hours away from me. As I've gotten older, I've made a conscious decision to keep them all at a distance. I will see them at major holidays, and will text them on occasion, but find them toxic and don't wish to engage in their ways. This bothers them greatly, and I hear I am often the topic of behind the back gossip. That makes me sad, but I've made my decision to keep them at arms length for this reason precisely. They are just not people I would like in my life in any meaningful way. 

Today, my mother got an earful from her mother and sister about how I never reach out to them, never speak to them and don't make an effort with them. I calmly said to my mother that they are not kind to me, not kind to her, and I don't have room in my life for toxic people. 

She said she hears me, but they are still family, and I should put in a better effort. I need to show more respect to them and that my actions to go low contact have affected her and my father, as they get the brunt of hearing from their family members that I never reach out. I do feel quite badly that they are always telling my parents they never hear from me or see me, but at the same time, I don't think I need to engage in relationships that make me uncomfortable. Clearly, my parents are from a different generation and feel that I am supposed to grit my teeth and suck it up. I'm confused and sad. AITA?"

After my grandfather's death some new information came forward that my mother's biological family was at her wedding and she didn't even know.

My mother passed away before more information could be found. She passed due to a genetic disorder that my siblings and I have all tested positive for.

Between this and the adoption one of my siblings have taken it upon themselves to get their genome mapped (like 23andMe but the full blown pro version). They've started a Facebook group of our family, including my mother's siblings who were also all adopted, to discuss theories and what not as we await the results (due in another 3 weeks).

I have opted out 3 times now. They keep adding me.

I think I've decided that I'm comfortable with the cultural identity I have. I'm also feeling like this would somehow be a betrayal to my mother - who had the opportunity to research but didn't, and my grandparents whom to me at least were always the most loving people.

The family really has come together around this. We are the closest we've been since her passing.

1459,es0iog,"AITA for Not Keeping In Touch First I want to give a little background:

From 2017 to the beginning of 2019 I was dealing with cancer & going through a lot of treatments that made me feel awful. During the first year and a half of treatment I tried to live my life as normally as I could by hanging out with friends, going out, working, etc. By 2018 my condition worsened and I needed to be hospitalized for a bone marrow transplant. The procedure had complications and I was hospitalized for longer than originally planned. 

During that year of treatment I didn't text or call my friends much because I spent a lot of time excruciatingly sick, in & out of black out like sleep, or too weak to get out of bed. By this time I had stopped leaving the house for long periods of time and was on extended disability & med leave from work.

That whole year my friends never called me, never visited me at the hospital, or make any type of communication to me. We have a group chat with all of us in it (5 people), despite feeling sick and not physically up to hanging out, I did send out a couple of text periodically seeing how they were doing and apologizing for not being able to hang out. Most of my texts went unanswered, so I eventually stopped altogether. No one even came to visit me in the hospital. My mother & wife came to see me daily, but my friends never showed up.

So now 2019 happens and I'm beginning to feel better. I eventually have my friends over once every so often. Things have changed. The first time I see them after a year we went out for a simple dinner. They spent the whole time talking around me about subjects I either knew nothing about (new anime they were watching as a group) or subjects I didn't care about (like Magic the Gathering). It was like I wasn't even there. I tried steering the conversation into neutral ground, something we could all weigh in on, but after a few half-assed replies the conversations would go back to not including me.

My oldest friend, we have been friends for almost 25 years, later apologized to me saying he was being a bad friend and I said I was being one too. And that was that.

I last saw them in Oct last year. Once November hit, I went into a deep depression because my latest check up was coming. It was an important check up as I was diagnosed with cancer December 2016, then after being in remission for a month & a half the cancer came back more aggressive in December 2017. Now After battling cancer during all of 2018, this new Dec. 2019 check up brought me depression & anxiety. Luckily I am still in remission, so after the holidays my depression began to lighten.

Now I don't know what to do. I'm angry because I feel like my friends don't talk to me or want to hang out unless I specifically start the conversation, but I also feel guilty because I think I've been a pretty bad friend.

I'm mad at them and I feel guilty all at the same time.

Am I the asshole here, am I the bad friend?"
1460,evwly4,"AITA for crushing my boyfriend's dreams of world peace? tl;dr: AITA for telling my boyfriend that his ideas around obtaining world peace are unrealistic?

What should also be known is that he battles moderate-severe BPD, but lately has not been medicated. He claims his mania helps his thoughts flow better and that the medicine slows him down.

Well, this whole thing has been going on for QUITE a while. He's always been into politics, but I think it's getting to be too much. 

He feels very passionately about joining people together in peace. These thoughts almost torture him. He cries when he thinks or speaks about it. He writes in a notebook with all of his thoughts and ideas about it. He's very passionate.

His ""goals"" are to unite ""ALL the various religious, spiritual, cultural, ethnic, educational leaders who share the vision of a world with less bigotry."" He wants to eventually be able to speak these ideas of anti-bigotry in a well worded, passionate, enlightening speech to a mass of people. I've never read this speech but he has apparently been writing it for months..

Today he described to me his ""phase one"", after I asked him what actual movements he's making to strive towards these goals. He basically described wanting to have conversations with leaders
of communities of all different types. Christian, Muslim, Jewish, etc. and bring them together at some kind of unifying meeting, like a cookout or something like that.

This is where I may have started to be TA. After many conversations about how his ideas are in the right place but what he wants to achieve might not be obtainable, I started, well..frankly ripping into him how unrealistic of an idea it is to think that ""leaders of spiritual communities"" will listen to what he has to say about world peace.

I told him his heart is in the right place, and I agree there should be less bigotry in the world, but the way he wants to go about ending it is vague, poorly planned, and stressing him AND me out.

He called me awful, pessimistic, and defeatist. I told him he almost sounds like a crackhead preaching about ""THE END"" on the streets. AITA?"
1461,cbaioo,"AITA for getting frustrated with potential tenant who came on the weekend? Ok, some background info: I assist my mother who manages the trailer park where we live. She’s sick, tired, and getting close to retirement age so myself and the assistant manager handle a lot of people before they deal with my mom if at all these days. I am unpaid and I absolutely hate doing park work but we need the money that mom’s income brings in.

Another piece of info: our home doubles as the trailer park office. I find that with the lines between home and office blurred, many people don’t respect our personal time, privacy, sometimes not even our personal property.

Anyway, on to what happened: Friday was the last day of rent taking for the month. That’s done until next month but we also have a ton of tenants who want to sell their trailers and a lot of people applying for permission to buy the trailers. Much to my frustration I am having to deal with potential tenants all month long.

Because I was tired I naively hoped no one would come Saturday but a woman did come. I was irritated but suppressed expressing it and just fetched her an application and explained what she needs to do and what she needs to bring. *Then I told her, please come back Monday, we are actually closed today and tomorrow.*  

I thought that was the last I’d see of her until Monday. But no, I was trying sit in our rocking chair and put my legs up when guess who drives up, very enthusiastically bringing her stuff to apply. Now, I was angry, but I was going to accept her items and explain again that we were closed and the park owner’s office 300 miles away is closed, so we can’t process the application until Monday and that’s the earliest she can expect an answer. 

But that was before I realized she didn’t have the money order to pay for the credit check. She wanted me to wait while she went to buy the money order but by now I am steaming and say no, come back Monday. She points out that the gas station three blocks from here sells money orders but I remind her I told her not till come back until Monday and she can wait till Monday.

I did see her drive into the park to see someone else yesterday but Monday came and went and Tuesday is nearly gone. She hasn’t been back. Part of me is concerned maybe my tone was not great and that it was unreasonable of me to not let her go get the money order. Am I the asshole?

I have two feelings here, one stewing in anger that she ruined my Saturday and the suspicion if she’s already ignoring business hours she might be like the tenants who come after 6 o’clock (closing time) and then bitch at me for not taking their rent because we’re trying to have dinner or I need to go grocery shopping or something. The other feeling is that I didn’t control my anger and I maybe scared a potential tenant off."
1462,e2cbz6,"AITA for cutting my mother out of my life? I am a little scared to post this but it has been 9 years and I am still unsure of my decision..... here goes:

Growing up, my mom was emotional and often demeaning. My parents divorced when I was 15, and I went to live with my dad. Once I got a bit older, we  got closer. I moved away, but we always talked several times a week.

6 weeks after my son was born, my mother flew to visit. My husband was deployed, I was emotional and full of hormones, and my mother turned out to be a stressful addition.

It started with transportation from the airport, which was a 2 hour drive each way. I had to go pick her up, with my newborn.  This was normal for her visits though.

The stress continued with her constant snarky comments about my home and parenting. I also had to cook for her, clean, and entertain all while caring for my first newborn. She even asked for a list of things she could do for fun in town during my  post-natal doctor appointment (I had to take the baby with me- it was my IUD procedure- less than ideal).

 I was already emotional, but the extra stress totally pushed me over the edge. It all blew up when she asked to hold the baby but I knew she had gone to the bathroom and NOT washed her hands. I asked her to wash her hands first.  She rolled her eyes, got huffy, and quickly rinsed her hands with water in the kitchen. I lost my head. I was totally over the top, and I screamed and cursed at her and told her to I was tired of her disrespect. She went to her room. 

I cried, put the baby down for a nap and went to apologize. I calmly and sincerely apologized for how I handled things and for how I spoke to her. I did hold firm that I needed her to be more respectful. She said several nasty things in return, and stated that she would need a ride to the bus stop.

I drove her to the bus.

I have never spoken to her again. She has never called, but has written a few cards and letters, more letters in the begining. The letters all included phrases such as ""I'd like to talk if you've grown up a bit and gained some maturity."" No apologies from her. I have never responded to her. 

The thing is, since I removed her from my life, I have become a better person. I have come to realize that she ALWAYS blamed other people for problems, was NEVER wrong, and generally treated other people poorly.  I was honestly a lot like her. I have changed so much for the better without her influence in my life. I am SIGNIFICANTLY more successful professionally, and personally. 

AITA for not trying to reconnect? I feel selfish, but I am so happy without having to deal with her. My husband tells me I will regret it if I don't mend this, but I don't think he understands what she was truly like, and the emotional abuse I dealt with as a child (something I didnt even recognize until I was free of her)"
1463,e7wnif,"AITA for not handing over medical receipts to future ex husband My husband and I have been estranged for several years and we have one child together. I am the custodial parent and he has visits twice a month.

When the support order was generated, the medical bills were to be split 60/40 (60% him). I am to provide the main insurance and he is secondary. I usually don’t even bother handing over small copay amounts or small medication amounts because it’s not worth the hassle.

This year, our child needed braces. I paid the entire amount upfront and he is paying me back his percentage in bi-weekly increments.  He asked me for a full itemized, original receipt because he wants to submit it to his insurance for ‘full reimbursement.”

Now, I don’t remember the specifics, but with his job, he can receive a full reimbursement for all medical expenses providing he has an original receipt. This is either directly through the insurance company or an FSA. He told me he will pay me back his 60% but his plan is to submit the entire bill and he wants to keep 100% of the reimbursement, but I disagree because then he’d be getting money back that he didn’t put out, so I am not giving him any receipts.

I am kind of curious if I’m TA here. Thanks."
1464,c3l68k,"AITA for being angry about being given a portrait of my fiance's cat? This past week my fiancé's mom came over with a portrait for us that she'd done of my fiancé's old cat. Except his ""old cat"" isn't dead or anything..he's with his ex girlfriend, Jasmine, and has been for the past four years.

&#x200B;

My fiancé and Jasmine got the cat after six months of dating & living together without ever making it clear who the cat belonged to. He broke up with her after maybe a year of dating and had ""custody"" of the cat, until his Jasmine's dad called my now-fiancé up saying that Jasmine was very depressed and could he please share the cat with her.

&#x200B;

This meant that every couple of months he would put the cat in a kennel and drive him over to her place, where she'd keep him for a couple of months. The cat absolutely HATED this and would get super stressed out; vomiting and hiding the first few days after these ""transfers"" happened.

&#x200B;

I met my fiancé probably about a year after he and Jasmine broke up. Jasmine was NOT happy about us getting together and tried several times to get my fiancé to cheat on me, bullied me on social media, and trash talked me to their mutual friends for about a year. He fought all of this but still kept on sharing the cat.

&#x200B;

After a year and a half of this I said that I wasn't going to force him to give up his pet or anything, but that I was breaking up with him because I couldn't handle this back-and-forth with no end in sight. Two days after I broke up with him, he told me he had given Jasmine the cat. When I asked why he didn't just keep him, he said it was because I was really allergic to him. I felt pretty terrible but I at least knew that Jasmine would take good care of him. We got back together and that was pretty much that.

&#x200B;

Back to my fiancé's mom. When my fiancé was growing up, she frequently got rid of his pets. She also *hated* this cat. Like, wanting to get rid of him every time she came over, complaining about his fur etc. And she hated Jasmine to the point of freaking out at her for not finishing small amounts of food. I can't figure out why his mom did this portrait-my fiancé thought she was doing it as a nice gesture, but she knew how sad he was after giving the cat away. I feel really terrible having to see it because it's like a constant reminder of not only my fiancé giving up the cat, but all the fights we had and Jasmine's shitty behaviour.

1465,baugz0,"AITA for not involving my sister more in wedding plans This is a long one, sorry. I’ll start off first saying that my sister and I are 7 years apart and not very close.  I am 31 now and she is 38.

When I was planning for my first wedding a few years back (unfortunately he passed away 11 days before the wedding), my sister made wedding planning difficult but I wanted for her to be involved. She lives in London so it was hard for me to include her in everything. But because she is my sister (and maid of honor), I went out of the way to make sure she was a part of it. For example, she comes home maybe 3 times a year so, for a week, so I made sure to wait to get my dress, pick flowers and get makeup trials until she was home.

So I had one day to pick the dress which she was there for. Then when we went to pick flowers she randomly brought one of her friends along (she doesn’t get to see her friends in the states that often so I kind of shrugged it off). But the day before my makeup trial, she said she was going with her friends to their beach house for the remainder of her time at home - and asked me to drive her. She spent the 2 hour drive on the phone with my aunt taking about MY WEDDING. Lastly, I had to set up my own bridal shower with my mom because she was running late at the gym and still had to take a shower.

Now flash forward to current planning. I waited again to get my dress until she got home but the whole time she was on her phone, hardly looking up or adding opinions. Then when we were brainstorming centerpieces, she was on her laptop saying she had to get some work done (it was Saturday).

So I’ve been moving along with ideas and purposely not sharing them. But on a recent call with my mom, she complained that I wasn’t sharing anything I was doing. She said she is really hurt and upset.

I feel that I have bent over backwards to try and include her and make her happy. 

A family member said that no matter what, I shouldn’t just do things without her - that she is my sister and it is mean to suddenly not include her. But I am ready to just say stay in London and not come to the wedding.

Am I the asshole?

1466,bwgetq,"AITA for not inviting my family to my wedding Throwaway for obvious reasons
Now, my fiancé and I have been planning our wedding and I have had no intention on inviting my parents from the start. They cut me off 5 years back after my now ex girlfriend had our child. We were barely out of high school at the time and were way too young to raise a kid on our own, my ex said she wanted to go to college and we broke up, so I raised my child by myself with no help from anyone in my family except my older sister. My sister has always been good to me and I know she wants the best for my son and I, but recently she’s been pushing to try to get me to reconcile with our parents. I’m very against this as they made their feelings very clear before and I have no reason to associate with them anymore. She’s been pressuring me to invite our parents to the wedding, I told her no countless times. One day, she invited our parents over to my place without my permission, she caused far more problems than she was trying to fix and I’m honest to god tired of it all. I haven’t spoken to her since she pulled that stunt and now I’m not even sure if I should invite her to my wedding because of what happened. I’m not sure if this is something that can be fixed before the wedding but I feel like I can’t trust her enough to invite her after what she did. Even though my fiancé says it’s okay if I don’t invite any of my family, I can’t help but feel guilty, I’m also afraid his family will think I’m an asshole for leaving my own family out. (His family has very strong family values and they’re all very close.) Am I being an asshole for excluding my family? Is excluding my sister going too far? 
Please let me know, this whole situation is stressing me out beyond belief."
1467,cfo89m,"AITA for getting involved in work drama? I work in childcare. My coworkers Molly and Sam hate each other, but I’m friendly with both.

Molly was a “mini-Manager”, stepping in and helping out when the actual manager was busy or gone for the day. Sam was a lead teacher.

Molly smokes weed on her lunch break; while I’m no stranger to weed, personally, I think that’s really stupid considering you’re working with other people’s kids and it’s clearly against policy, but hey, she’s a grown woman. Previously she’s asked Sam if she wanted to join, which Sam declined.

A few weeks ago, Sam quit in the middle of a shift. It had been building for some time, mostly due to the management, but Molly was the final straw, as she and Sam got into it in the hours before she quit.

Sam proceeded to send an email to the owner detailing her grievances and one of them was the fact that Molly smokes during working hours. Over the next few days, the manager called some people into the office to ask if they smoked weed, and mentioned to one that random drug tests might happen.

Molly somehow found out that Sam had made the complaint, and was bitching about it. She told me, “Fine, if she wants to play that way, I’m going to call DCFS on her.”

Now, Sam might make some questionable choices- she’s still with the daughter’s father, who’s been picked up on more than one occasion for gang activity and selling drugs- but she works hard at being a good mom. Her daughter is happy and well cared for. She’s well fed and at a healthy weight, clean clothes, doing well in school, just got braces- in other words, safe, healthy, and by no means abused or neglected as far as I can tell. 

I felt uncomfortable with the fact that Molly is making threats to call DCFS because of this. Yes, I can see why she’s pissed about being narc’d on, but she was the one who chose to smoke weed at work, and was dumb enough to talk about it. I think threatening someone about their kid is a low blow- she’s not doing it out of concern for the kid, but as a way to get revenge.

Because of that, I texted Sam and let her know about these threats. I told her what Molly said, and also asked her to keep it from coming to light that I was the one who told her- I don’t need Molly to retaliate or try to get me fired.

Sam thanked me profusely and is taking steps to protect herself- filing a report with the police to have the threats documented, calling DCFS and explaining what’s going on, and sent an email to the owner about it as well. 

Molly is no longer a mini-manager, just a teacher, and Molly told me it was because of everything going on. She’s now texting Sam telling her she’s going to beat her ass,etc. Sam is documenting all these threats and isn’t responding.

So far, Molly has no idea it came from me, and she’s still friendly with me.

AITA for getting involved in this mess, ratting out Molly, and staying cordial with her to keep the peace at work?"
1468,chnmka,"AITA for changing out the coffee? So I work in a pretty close knit office floor. We all share one kitchen on our floor and usually one large coffee pot. Now the coffee is not provided by our employer so we all take turns buying coffee, most of us agree to get mild, non flavored coffee that is not too expensive. Anyways, we have this older gentlemen who just started working on our floor and he usually gets in before anyone else. I noticed he started making coffee for the entire floor! What a nice guy! I also started to notice, because its the morning, the trash is always empty in the kitchen, meaning he did not throw away the previous afternoons coffee grounds. I joked around with him that they where the old grounds just to find out, and he was like ""yeah! Ground's can be used for up to four times over!""

Least to say I was a little grossed out, especially after the grounds sit in a moist area all night long. I feel like mold could be growing in it. Not wanting to make the guy feel bad I've been coming in right behind him and just making a fresh pot after he makes the old ""fresh"" pot. He has not caught me yet though. Does this make me TA?"
1469,adm44j,"AITA for wanting to take my name off an apartment co-sign/lease with my “best friend” because i (18F) learned she (18F) was going to move in with her boyfriend (20M) because I couldn’t move in at the time?  We’ve been planning to move in together for the longest time, then she gets a boyfriend, they’ve only been together 5 months but has known each other for longer and already want to move in with each other. My biggest pet peeve with him, is that he hasn’t asked her to be his girlfriend, he just started calling her that. 
 
She’s moving into a one bedroom, in 6 months she’ll be able to put in a transfer request to a bigger apartment so that i can move in. She said i have 6 months to save up money so that i can move in. But she didn’t bring up that she’d be moving him in...I don’t think it’s fair to me, to stay on the lease when he can be on it. The only problem is, is that he’s on probation and the apartment runs a background check on the applicants. She’s asked me to stay on the lease because he’s almost off probation, and she won’t be able to get the apartment by herself. But i think if she really wanted to move in with him, she should wait til he’s off probation...if she even can get an apartment with him.
 
She told me that she asked him if it would be okay if i moved in with them in 6 months and he said it’d be fine. Nobody that i know of moves out with their boyfriend and in with their best friend, that’s unheard of. I even told her that i wouldn’t move out with if i moved in with my boyfriend.

I finally got back yesterday night, took a shower and went straight to bed because I was feeling like absolute shit. It just so happens that this trip coincided with some of my cousins visiting over the same week (said cousins live in different continent, we very rarely see them. I'd say we see each other every 7 or so years, so I never really had much proximity with them). Today I wake up with a splitting headache, barely being able to breathe through my nose (I have chronic sinus infection so this happens more than I'd like), coughing up a storm with my throat being absolutely destroyed. My mom tells me I have to go see my cousins because they're leaving tomorrow morning, to which I respond ""No, I'm sick, there's no way I'm leaving the house like this, I have to rest."" This exact combination of words obviously triggers some sort of hidden switch in my mom's brain because she absolutely explodes : ""What do you mean you're not going?! They were so excited to see you! They're your family! You haven't seen them in years!"" and it only worsens when I tell her that that's exactly the reason I'm not making the extra effort to go see them. She then decides to stop arguing, which I assume means that we got to an agreement, but no, she decides to call them and further confirm that I am indeed going to see them.

I(19F) live with my older brother(35M) and his wife(33F) and kids(12M,10F,8M) and they have a surprise little one on the way. I'm an organized person, I keep everything in my room in its place, everything in my binder and schoolbag, everything that I own. Recently I realized just how untidy their kids are and I've been helping them deep cleaning their rooms, helping them organizing and giving them tips on how to maintain it, all that jazz. They've been behaving a lot better than they already have and they're picking up after themselves properly, I was proud to make an impact on my niece and nephews like this. The other day my SIL was looking for something in one of their rooms(I guess something they weren't supposed to have) and she was impressed with how clean their rooms were and was able to find it easily. She showed my brother since she knew he was getting stressed out about this and he was actually angry because his kids actually listened to me. He said I needed to teach him how to do it but he would not listen to me one bit. I eventually got mad that he wasn't listening and I walked away to recollect myself, I am not a reactive person and this is what I do. He later got mad because I walked away on him he called me a neat-freak and he has no idea where I came from in the family, like, ouch man, that hurt.

1472,c922gz,"AITA for telling a group of women to stop staring at me? I'm 7 months pregnant. I am carrying really large in front, none of my maternity clothes fit, and it's hot outside. I'm uncomfortable, self concious and miserable.

Everywhere I go, I am approached by women who either gawk at me, touch my belly, ask if I'm days away from giving birth, and when that answer is no, ask if I'm having twins. I can't go a single day without hearing some kind of comment about it and it's starting to wear me down.

There is a group of 3 older women who sit outside my apartment building in the smoking hut. I see them every day. I see them when I leave for school, I see them when I return from school, I see them when I go to work and I see them when I go shopping. Each time they stare. They just sit there, smoking and staring. When I wave at them, they wave back but continue to watch me walk into the building. It makes me so uncomfortable.

I can understand the comments I get from strangers because strangers don't usually see pregnant women every day, but these women see me every single day. They stare like I'm some sort of spectacle and I hate it. 

A couple of days ago, I was following behind as my boyfriend hauled our new carseat to the car and I was so hot and upset that none of my expensive maternity clothes were fitting me and there they were, staring.

So I walked up to them and said something along the lines of, ""Can you please stop staring at me every time I leave and come home?""

One of them replied with, ""Oh it's just that you're so big and cute and you seem to get bigger every day!""

So I replied, ""Yup and I'm going to continue to get bigger and it's not going to stop until I have the baby and I deserve to be able to come home without feeling uncomfortable by a group of women who stare at me every single day. Knock it off. I don't like it. You're making me uncomfortable.""

I didn't wait around for a response. My boyfriend told me it was the best thing to do, but my dad said it was rude and I could have handled it better. The apartment manager said the ladies have told him I made them uncomfortable and should consider apologizing. I said N.O.

AITA?

TL;DR: 7 months pregnant and 3 ladies continually watch me at our apartment building. I basically told them to stop being creeps. Dad and building manager said it was uncalled for.

Edit: The smoking hut is so close to the sidewalk on the way to the building that saying ""Hello, how are you doing today?"" while I'm walking by would be better than just STARING. They wouldn't even have to raise their voices, that's how close I get to them. I've even said hello loads of times and all I've gotten back are small smiles or waves. A few times I've looked back once I've reached the front door and they're still looking at me! It makes no sense.

Also - when I am touched and tugged on by strangers, and asked inappropriate questions, I grab their hands and say, ""Stop."" ""Please don't."" ""That's really none of your business."" with a smile. I can't do much else because this happens while I'm working or at school.

Edit 2: From the comments, I'll start letting random people touch me and tug on me and adjust my clothes all they want because it's rude of me to want otherwise. I'll ignore their stares every day. I won't even bother saying hi anymore since I'm just entertainment for these ladies (who are not old, btw. I'd say mid 30s to 40s. I said older as in older than me. Sorry for the unclarity.) and each time I see a pregnant woman I'm going to do the same because I've learned it's not creepy and pregnant women should let strangers do whatever they please with them.

1473,b4cffz,"AITA for not wanting to give my grandma a puppy? For starters, I Love my grandma and she's amazing with her pets(mostly chickens) 
      My dad wants to give her a dog, which is not a very good idea. She's very small and almost our entire family lives on the same place, so everyone is always over at grandma's. The puppy always wants to be at someones feet, if we are not careful, all the time, we'll probably step on her. On that house, everyone is always in a hurry, they won't pay attention. And a small piece of everyone, are entiltled brats.(lots of stories, but that's for a another post)
They are horrible to my dog, they run around so she will chase them, but when she gets tired they force her to get up, poking, pushing and screaming. And to make things worse, my dad is a hell of a entitled uncle(yup, not their dad, my dad). Even if he claims to Love our dog, he'll let them do those horrible things, but screams at ME when I tell them to stop
""Don't be a bother and let them play, they're just kids"". Once they messed up my dog so bad, that she  didn't eat for two whole days, but hey, they're just kids.
When one of the little shits got a dog, they played with it for like a week and forgot it, cause ""it isn't as pretty as yours"" They still play with it sometimes, but the dog hates them all and it's starting to get agressive, unlike mine. Imagine what they will do, to a small, cute and new puppy, that wouldn't be able to fight back
That's only some of the reasons why I don't think sending a puppy there is a good idea. I Love my grandma, but she doesn't have the condition to take care of the puppy neither the enviroment. I've getting some angry looks from my father because of that and he thinks it's unfair of me, especially because my grandma really wants a dog
So, Am I the asshole for not wanting to send the puppy there?

1474,dozihb,"WIBTA if I ask my roommate to be more clean and responsible when I am not a perfect roommate either? My roommate, let’s call her Emma (19f) and I (19f) are college students living in our first apartment. We were friends prior to being roommates, but not very close. 

We’re both very busy, but I put in a lot of effort to keep things on the neater side. I do dishes about every day and tidy and pick up both of our trash. I also grocery shop every weekend. She almost never comes with, which means she almost never pays for food. (She sometimes eats at the college dining hall, so I don’t pay for every single thing she eats, but she eats a lot of the food I cook.) She never cooks for herself, so she can’t repay me by letting me eat some of what she cooks. She sometimes eats my food without asking/venmoing me. She almost never cleans, however, to the point that sometimes it feels like I’m her older sister taking care of her or something. 

The kicker is that she is always criticizing me for this and that. Yelling at me for not doing the dishes, making fun of me for “starting fires” when I made a quesadilla a little too crisp, and making passive aggressive comments about the cleanliness of this or that. When she has a criticism, she uses a condescending, singsong tone as if she’s talking to a child, which drives me crazy because she’s the one that won’t cook or clean like an adult. I’m fine with being corrected! Just speak to me like a peer/equal!

And she almost never cleans anything herself. Often, extra plates and surfaces are dirty because I made some food or drink for HER when she had a bad day. 

The reason I’m posting to ask for judgment is because I have my faults as a roommate too. I don’t want to ask her to stop doing all these things because I’m afraid I’m being a hypocrite. I have a couple bites of her snacks too, sometimes. I don’t always do all the dishes right away. I watch TV at one in the morning sometimes, although I try to keep the volume down. I have a significant other who is over all the time (she has her own place but her roommates are even worse.) Important to note that my roommate and SO are very good friends and really like each other, so that might not be too big a problem. 

Anyway, Emma and I are good friends and I really like her. I don’t want to criticize her if I would be a hypocrite, because I want to be a good roommate to her.

1475,c5uwdc,"AITA for not buying/giving my baby meat? So I have a nearly 7 month old son. 

He's started eating some foods but mostly just tastes of porridge and fruit and veg etc.

For context, my partner is a meat eater and I'm a vegetarian. I like to think I'm not militant, I don't try to persuade anyone to go veggie. You do you. 

My partner and I had a conversation today about our son progressing to bigger meals. I mentioned that I probably wouldn't be buying meat or products with meat in for him but I have no problem with my partner doing so if he wishes. 

My partner questioned me about this as he feels that I would be encouraging vegetarianism upon our son. He thinks I shouldn't go out of my way to avoid meat and that he needs the nutrients and choice.

From my point of view I'd still be giving my son a varied, nutritional diet - I've done some research and there doesn't seem to be any impact on a child being a full vegetarian, let alone one that would still sometimes have meat. If I'll be cooking meals for myself, it just makes sense for my son to have them too and he can also sometimes have meals with his dad which probably include meat. 

He's too young at this stage to be able to choose which diet to follow or to understand why people do/don't eat meat so why would I go out of my way to encourage meat now? 

If, when he is old enough to choose, he would like to eat meat then I'm absolutely fine with that and will purchase/prepare whatever he likes.

1476,ck31nx,"AITA for basically blowing someone off who said something in order to get me to “change her mind”? This is a very stereotypical situation I suppose, but I really feel split on this one.

I was talking to a girl that I had met on Tinder, and we seemed to really hit it off 2 days ago. 

I thought she was really chill and pretty, and we started talking about hanging out this weekend.

I had prefaced this by explaining that I work nights and that I either would have Thursday or Friday off, but didn’t know which (my manager is incompetent). 


We also live about 3 hours apart- not too bad, but enough of a distance where planning to meet is a nuisance. 

Anyway, first she becomes annoyed when I tell her that I am currently unsure of my schedule and that she’d be the first to know when I knew. Frustrating for both of us, but thats out of my hands.

Then, she tells me that she is nervous and that she wants to push off meeting another week.

I figured that she wanted to talk more to feel more comfortable meeting up with a tinder dude, so I was like “yeah sure”.

Then, she got annoyed because “She wanted me to talk her out of it” instead of agree with her. 

I get I am a little slow on the uptake sometimes, but I could find plenty of reason to believe she was serious and now I feel like an ass for asking for clearer communication.

He moved out of my place, but in a very messy and inconsiderate way - missed the move out date he set himself without telling me about it, showed up just with a truck and was suprised when I didn't want to spend the day helping him move, returned my key to me days after - and entering the apartment to wash clothes because his gym and workplace were closer to my apartment than his then-couch at a friends.
He didn't do any of that in a malicious way, but rather ""what suits him best without considering anybody elses feelings"".

I received his financial statements up til May of this year because he would only change his adress for all the subscriptions and mail when I told him explicitly which - because he is lazy and puts things off until he needs them. basically a great summary of our relationship and why it ended.

I asked him to get his mail in order because after the 12th time of telling him, it would go straight to the trash. I also told him I want to break off contact, he would message me because he sent some important papers to my adresse (again), I just wanted none of this anymore. Also I have him blocked on any social media.

last week I came across him twice, there was a company 6k race where my teammates and I met up after the finishing line (easy identifiable cuz of our company jerseys) and he apparently was an onlooker and saw me running into the finish. he came explicitly to my team, looking for me.
I left when he tapped me on the shoulder and said hi.

yesterday I went to the open house of the local art school and watched a performance, there he is again and wants to make conversation about the race and how I left so suddenly.
I told him flat out I am here with somebody and really don't want to speak to him. 
He went on to declare loudly why I can't just get over it and made a scene - I felt extremely uncomfortable with all the people there gathered for the art performance, when he called me difficult and a a bitch for being so sour after almost a year now.
My date tried to confront him, but I said ""leave me alone"" and left with my date, who seemed really uncomfortable as well.

I don't hate my ex, he just made the entire breakup process really inconvenient and even after that impacted me with his laziness by not taking care of his trash (furniture he left behind in my basement) and his mail and expecting me to run to my mailbox to check if his stuff arrived. I just want to be left alone, just not acknowledge him when he passes me on the sidewalk"
1478,evfouw,"AITA for approaching a police officer to ask for directions? Hi all!

I’ve created a throwaway account as I’d rather not have any of these personal details linked to my main. 

For context, I am 24F. I’m quite tiny, I weigh 46kg and am about 5ft exactly. Not what I would assume would be an intimidating presence. 

Onto the story:
Last weekend, my sister and I, and a group of our friends travelled a few hours to another city to celebrate the long weekend. (I live in Australia). 

On the Saturday night, I somehow got separated from my friend group and started to try and walk back to where we were staying (which wasn’t far). I didn’t have my debit card with me as my partner had kept it in his pocket for the night so I wouldn’t lose it. All I had was my ID and my phone. I wasn’t sure if I had enough money on my card to order an Uber either. 

I am (in general), terrible with directions and took a wrong street. I don’t live in this city either so I’m not overly familiar. As I was walking I saw a police officer ahead. I decided I’d (politely) ask him for help/to point me in the right direction of where I was trying to get to. 

Before I could even get any words out, he held his hand in my face and yelled at me to “back the fuck up and get away from him”.  So I did. I immediately turned around and walked the other direction. However, it really rattled me to the point of having a panic attack. I got so hysterical and couldn’t calm down so I got even more lost. 

I’ve never approached a police officer for anything thus far in my life. I realise just needing directions is trivial and not really in their job description. However, the officer had no idea what I was approaching him with. As someone who has been s**ually ass*ulted in the past, it really pissed me off that he would be so rude and, in my opinion, aggressive. I really don’t think I’d ever feel comfortable or safe in approaching an officer for anything again, to be honest. 

I don’t know if I had actually done anything wrong though. I had been drinking but I wasn’t incoherent, slurring or stumbling. I was fine until he yelled at me at which point triggered something in me and I became panicked. 

AITA for approaching him in the first place? Am I missing some sort of law/rule against this type of thing? If so, please let me know. The whole experience just rubbed me the wrong way but if I was actually in the wrong perhaps I won’t feel so let down and will feel safe in the future if I ever need to approach a police officer again."
1479,eqb23f,"WIBTA for filing a chargeback against an artist? So I ordered an art print Nov 11 with the intent of giving it as a Christmas gift. Shortly after I recieved tracking information telling me that it was being shipped by Correos Chile which proved to be fairly spotty with updating the tracking data. 

On December 9th the tracking data showed that it had arrived in the country of delivery and was in Liberty, Kansas which was concerning as it was supposed to be coming to Canada.  In the following weeks I tried to email address on the original website, the PayPal receipt, and Correos Chile trying to find out whether or not the package had been transferred to a different mail carrier or ""delivered"" with no response. 

January 3rd I was able to get ahold of the artist on Instagram. He asked for the package information to, I assume, look into the missing package. After not hearing anything for a week I asked again and was told to keep waiting without and information to back it up. 

WIBTA if I filled a chargeback with PayPal? He says it's still coming but the 90 day dispute window is coming to an end and if it doesn't come I'd have no recourse."

1481,bw1b51,"WIBTA for reporting someone copying me in an exam and potentially getting them disqualified Before you instantly NTA because cheating is wrong, read the whole post.

Short background: it's exam season and someone has copied me in one of the maths exams. I know this because they stated before the exam that since they were sitting next to me they intended to copy from me, and after the exam they the  informed others of how they copied from me.

This person isn't a mean or bad person, they're perfectly kind and pleasant, they're just not very good at maths. They are in jeopardy of failing the subject, and if they do they will have to continue re-taking it until they are 18 or they pass it, so they have taken the decision to copy my answers in an attempt to pass.

I haven't yet reported them because I don't know whether I should. I'm aware that cheating is obviously wrong and they don't deserve to pass by copying someone else, however....

If I report them to the exam staff and they notice the person attempting to copy from me in the next maths exam (bearing in mind it's not guaranteed they'll be caught if I report them), they will almost certainly be disqualified from the exam and fail the subject, screwing over (or at least making very painful) their next few years of life since they'll need to retake and wait a whole year to do so.

Also, if they are disqualified from the subject, they could also potentially be disqualified from several (and possibly all) of their other subjects, meaning they'll leave school with no qualifications due to this one incident. This depends on how severely the incident is viewed by the exam providers. In worst case they could be banned from taking future exams for a number of years, although this is unlikely.

So, WIBTA for reporting someone who has cheated, if it means getting them disqualified from getting their maths qualification and potentially all others, svrewing up the next few years of their life, for one stupid mistake they're making as a teenager?

EDIT: some people have raised the concern around me potentially getting in trouble for enabling them to cheat if I don't report them, bit due to how these exams are taken nationally and not marked by our schools own teachers, cheating doesn't get detected at the marking level, the only time is really when the exam is taking place. basically, me getting in trouble isn't a concern."
1482,eislck,"AITA for going on a 4 week roadtrip after finding out my gf is pregnant? Me(19M) and my GF(18f) just found out earlier this week that we're going to be having our first kid. Totally not planned, big oops, but whatever we're moving on. We've been together since we were 15 so although we definitely don't have our shit all together, we're not planning on breaking up any time soon. Both of us get along with each others parents and they're as supportive as can be expected. 

Now I know that my life is going to change drastically and I'm not going to get to do all the random teenage stuff I should be doing after high school and I'm okay with that. However, my friend and I have been planning this cross country trip for about a year. It's like 4 weeks, driving from the east coast to the west coast and back. My gf is okay with as my last chance to be a kid. She said her parents weren't upset with the idea. My dad(no mom around) said it's up to my gf and I need to make her happy from now on. The problem is my gfs older sister whos flippin out saying I'm a deadbeat and an asshole and probably am never coming back. My rebuttal to her is that I've had a job for about 3 years now, and have a better one lined up for when I get back, and both me and my gf are signed up for online college classes(those regular ones like math and English), and are planning on finishing our degrees once our baby turns two or so. Probably just will have to be one at a time though, but I'm obviously planning on coming back. Plus I'm not going to throw away the girl I've been in love with for 4 years to try and start a new life in Cali.

Anyway... Am I the asshole for still going away for 4 weeks after finding out my gf is pregnant?

1484,db0jc9,"AITA for shutting down my sister’s house party? My parents are gone for the weekend and last night at about 10 PM, I (M16) saw my sister (17F) stealing alcohol from my parent’s liquor cabinet and called her stupid but didn’t make a big deal out of it. My sister goes to parties fairly often and I generally don’t care because it is not my business and if my parents find out it won’t affect me, so I let her do her thing. I have made it very clear with her in the past that I won’t tell my parents about anything she does as long as it doesn’t affect me in a negative way.

After seeing this, I went to bed at about 11 PM and was woken up at 1 AM by loud screams and my dogs barking. After leaving my room I saw that my sister had a large group of her friends over and were drinking and playing party games. Many of her friends are people who bullied me in middle school so I am not very fond of them in the first place, but let me just say I was PISSED. I told them to shut up, but they were still being loud and I couldn’t go back to sleep.

At about 1:30 AM I brought my sister into my room and started screaming at her louder that I ever have before. I am generally a very calm person, but something about the situation made me go into a confused rage and I started screaming at her about how rude she was being, why she thinks she has the right time throw this party, threatened to tell my parents. To say I was mad would be an understatement. She eventually started yelling back at me and it turned into a screaming match. After a few minutes of doing this, I told her that everyone needed to leave the house or else I would call my parents and tell them about everything that happened this night. By 2:00 AM everyone was gone and I finally fell back asleep at 4 (I needed to be up by 7 so this added to my anger).

AITA for shutting down my sister’s party and screaming at her? I feel like I may have overreacted but I’m not sure if I was in my right to ruin the party or not."
1485,c99gvl,"AITA-Don't Want Relationship w/Bio Child-reposted due to word-count When I was a young man I fathered a child. The mother and I both agreed to abortion and I gave her the money for it. We parted company and I assumed she had the abortion. A year later she came to me and said she'd had the baby. I told her nothing had changed, I still didn't want a relationship but I would gladly provide financial security. I was born into a well-off family and my parents activated one of my trusts. I signed the entire thing over to the child, Carmen, and went to court to give up my rights, agreeing to child support. I was assigned one amount but I paid double that, increasing as the years went on to reflect my growing financial status.

&#x200B;

In the years after Carmen's birth I graduated with a phd, entered a career field that has made me a very wealthy man, married and fathered two amazing girls. Through all this I promptly paid my child support and made sure the trust I signed over was growing healthily. Carmen's mother harassed me for several years to have a relationship with Carmen but I always declined. Several times she harassed my wife and daughters in an attempt to ""reason"" with me. I. never wavered in my mindset, I never met Carmen.

&#x200B;

In 2016 Carmen started attempting to contact me. She wrote a letter to which I replied politely and kindly with firm rejection. I wasn't cruel but I was frank. She's leave it but pop up again every few months and I'd gently decline her attempts. My parents and my daughters have all also declined to have a relationship with her despite having always had my blessing to have a relationship.

&#x200B;

When her attempts started escalating I made some financial threats. The trust I set up for her had some stipulations. She could have just enough to pay for college and the remainder would be released to her when she turned 30, which will be very soon. She started harassing us with phone calls and letters and emails, she found my daughters' various social medias and harassed them despite their declinations of her attempts. I told her I'd take her trust away if she didn't stop.

&#x200B;

Recently she showed up at my father's family reunion and introduced herself as my daughter. I was stressed after three years of her behavior and snapped. I yelled at her, told her the trust was as good as gone, and that she was the worst mistake I ever made. She left in tears. I called my money manager and took away the trust, which I still control.

&#x200B;

As time has passed I regret how I spoke to her but not taking away her trust fund. My family feels that it was too harsh and I should give it back. I wrote Carmen a letter apologizing for my behavior. Her mother wrote back and said that I was a dead-beat father and a horrible person and they both feel entitled to some of my amassed wealth. I told her that as far as Carmen is concerned I'm done, she'll never see a penny from me again.

&#x200B;

I'm conflicted, AITA?

&#x200B;

ETA: the consensus is ESH, and I agree wholeheartedly. I'll make strides.

&#x200B;

ETA: I was 20 years old when Carmen was born. The mother made the choice to abort, took my money, and didn't speak to me or contact me for a year until Carmen was a newborn. I literally had a newborn sprung on me. The mom at least had nine months to get used to the idea. What if she had been adopted out after birth and she was coming looking for biological family? Her mother made the choice to have her after telling me one thing and I'm supposed to just jump on board. I DID NOT WANT A CHILD. And why is not wanting a relationship with a stranger so terrible. I never lied about my intentions. I was always up front from the beginning that I would never be involved. How is it my fault that Carmen's mother got her expectations up? I had nothing to do with this girl beyond conception and my legal obligation to pay for her living. I did a hell of a lot more than most absentee parents do; at least I cared enough to provide for her.

&#x200B;

ETA: I just realized something I never mentioned: Carmen and her mother lived across the country from my family and I. My family and I live in Connecticut, she and her mother live in Washington State. Carmen moved to CT in 2016. Before that move across country the only time I ever met her or spoke to her was when she was about two months old. So between roughly March of 1990 and July of 2016 I never met the child or spoke to the child. The mother, however, would occasionally call my house and make demands, going so far as to call and scream at my wife. So maybe I am somewhat biased against Carmen for her mother's attitude but what needs to be understood is I relinquished my rights, I never had any rights to Carmen after her birth, not that I ever wanted them. And considering her mother took her all the way across the country from where I was would have made having a proper relationship very difficult. Sure you can try as a parent (which I am not) to make it work, people do it everyday, but the point is, I did not want to. I wish this sub-reddit didn't have a word limit, there's so much of the story I had to leave out to hit the 3000 word limit. I can't possibly explain a 30 year history in 3000 words. I respect those who say that IATA or ESH but try and remember, this is not the entire story, but just what I could fit in this box. Oh, I've decided to give the trust back but I'm turning the control of it over to someone else. I have also spoken to Carmen and have agreed to one meeting, a single meeting. I will answer any questions she may have but that is it. That is all I'm willing to give. Frankly, my family isn't comfortable having her around nor am I. My daughters, the ones she's been harassing, are 14 and 13. Carmen has been harassing actual children. Getting on the social media pages of two pre-teen girls. When she started harassing them my girls were 10 and 9. Yes, I allowed my children that young to have social media, protected by my wife and I of course. So to the people who are sending me death and violence threats against myself and my family, please remember you're getting 3000 words vs 30 years of history. PS: who the hell threatens a 13 year old girl with rape?"
1486,byh9qc,"WIBTA For Moving Out Since my Roomate got A Dog and Didnt Ask for My Approval Last year I moved into an apartment with two other guys and we split rent evenly. My one roommate always talked about getting a dog and whenever the conversation came up I told him that I dont like dogs and would want to talk about it before he got one. In January I took a temporary position across the country but continued to pay rent back home since the position was only for a few months and my rent was cheap.

About a week and a half ago, my uncle died. He lived his entire life with my grandmother in a trailer. He was her caretaker. They had a lot of pets. 3 dogs, 12 cats, and a parrot. On the 7th, my mom woke me up to tell me my uncle might be dead. My mom, dad, and myself went to my grandma's trailer, and the medics confirmed it. The police were also there, and to make a long story short the house was deemed unfit for human residence. I.E it was a complete shithole, like one of those episodes of Hoarders. My dad, being a good son, offered my grandma to stay by us for the time being while she sorts everything out. 

These pets are all horrible. None of them were house broken and they keep shitting and pissing everywhere. My parent's house smells like urine. The dogs keep running around making noise, when one barks, all of them barks. They bark at the slightest sound. There are cats crawling everything, jumping on the tables and shedding on all the couches. The parrot won't shut up, it keeps meowing and barking and saying my uncle's name. It won't stop. 

I am the one who has to take care of these animals, even though I didn't agree to it. I have to change the litter boxes, walk the dogs, and feed them. Also, every time I try to clean the birdcage or feed the parrot, it tries to bite me.

1489,dj8pqg,"AITA for telling my wife's best friend that the guy she's only been casually talking to online and never met can't come on the group vacation we've had planned? My wife, her best friend (Susie), and her best friend's brother (Joe), and myself are all going on a trip. Anyways, we are leaving tomorrow and last night Susie decides to drop some news on my wife. She tells her that some guy she's been casually talking to online from halfway across the country bought a ticket and is joining for the entire 4-day weekend. They have never met and Susie has been dating other guys in our home state, so it's not like this is even some committed LDR. We did not even know this guy existed until last night.

The original point of this trip was to celebrate Joe turning 21. Susie even moved the original dates so that my wife and I could join. We all hang out quite often, either in groups of 3 or 4, and always have a good time. So we are small group where everyone is comfortable with each other and the dynamic is solid.

So Susie tells my wife this guy is coming. That he, quote, ""Asked me what I was doing this weekend. I told him and next thing I know he says he bought the ticket and will see us there."" Susie claims the guy gave her a 24-hour window to tell her not to come. Obviously she did not put a stop to it or consult with ANY of us on how we felt about it. Plus this is a weirdly aggressive move by him.

Now instead of a small-knit group where everyone is good with each other, either split apart or together...we have this thirsty AF 5th-party that we weren't told about until a day and a half before the flight. I told Susie that I don't care if his refund window has passed, this dude should not be coming and she's being selfish. If he does come, my wife and I are very likely going to split off and do whatever we want (poor Joe is getting hosed in this situation). I don't go on vacation to chaperone people's first dates. I also don't want to be dealing with awkward small talk and ""getting to know someone."" Plus, people always act differently around a group that they are truly comfortable with versus on a first-date with someone they have never physically met. So Susie, the version of her that we are friends with, won't really be on vacation either. Safety-wise, who knows...this guy could come off as the nicest person on the planet but still be up to no good when the sun goes down. This is just not the appropriate time to decide whether or not he's a cool dude that deserves everyone's trust.

Susie is telling me to chill and it'll be fine. The typical stuff of ""You're overreacting, just relax and go with the flow, it's my life and my vacation."" My counterpoint, along with all the points above, was, ""If you really needed to meet him so badly, you should've had him come stay near you another time and hang out with him alone. If things went really well, ask us to join for dinner one night and meet him that way. A four day trip that we planned as a group is not the time or place for this.""

Am I the asshole for putting an ultimatum on this of ""tell him not to come, or we'll be enjoying ourselves without you guys?"""

I hardly have time for myself right now and I’ve been severely stressed and depressed. 

So this past weekend was my little brothers birthday party. My mom kept trying to “force” me to come. Even though that irritated me, I had every intention of going.  However I woke upto a snow storm and decided not to go because the roads were bad, my car is having problems and I’m driving around with a smashed out window. My mom called and I tried to explain but she got mad and hung up. Besides this incident, she keeps telling me I have “no choice” in attending a family dinner in a few weeks and continues to be very rude and controlling. 

I feel bad for not being around/distant for the past 1-2 months but I have legitimately no energy for people and this only continues to add to my stress. I am trying to currently get sober and focus on my declining health. I plan on sending my lil bro a card with a decent amount of money but I ended up blocking my mom and have no plans to speak to her or attend any family gatherings for a while.

Now, I use an iPhone 5s and my mother uses an Oppo. The earphones between both phones are drastically different (Oppo having those rubber things at the end, and iPhones do not).  


I wanted a pair of earphones kinda desperately only because I was annoying everyone around me by just listening to music on speakers. So I asked my mom if she could get a pair for me.

1492,ea8s7t,"AITA for Avoiding my Best Friend? So, my best friend and I have been close since we were freshmen in high school. Today, we are sophomores in college, and we're still fairly close. This year has been a different one for our friendship, as I transferred to a larger university a few hours from where we lived instead of being at the same local community college for my second year. I know it's been rougher on him since he regularly texts me letting me know that he's lonely or that it's hard for him without me there, but we've managed to set up a weekly time to call each other and catch up. Now, to be completely transparent, I'm a pretty flaky person. I've been better in the last year or so as I've been working hard to manage my anxiety which often prompts me to cancel plans, but I'm still not the most reliable when it comes to making plans unless we have a set time and day. But, let's get into what happened today.

  I came home from college late last night for winter break. We had made some vague plans to hang out the day after I got home, and I had let him know that I was excited to see him and catch back up. This morning, I woke up with five missed calls from him. Immediately, I figured that I must have slept through whatever plans he had in mind, so I called him back. He answered and let me know that he was on his way to my house. Even though my best friend and I have been close for a long time, this is something that made me uncomfortable. And so I told him no, that I had just woken up and that I figured we'd hang out after his work which is what we usually did anyway. He was insistent that we hang out right now, that I didn't need to get ready or change anything since we were just going to Target. Even though I repeatedly told him no, he kept pushing that he was going to show up at my house regardless if I was ready or not and that if I made him sit outside until he had to leave for work then I was a bitch. I was a little pissed off at this point, so I told him that if he shows up that doesn't mean that I was going to answer the door or talk to him. Right now, he's parked outside of my house and I'm afraid to walk past my windows in case he sees me and feels the need to pressure me to come outside or hang out with him right this second.

She asks if I can shower at 7 or something so the shower doesn't bother her. 

-I feel a little upset and tell her that she is being picky. I say 1. I have to be out the door by 7, and sometimes the trains are delayed. I can't risk being late 2.My schedule is already rushed 3. I don't have to cook for them since we all cook our own meals and I always clean after myself. 

-Roommate is upset and cuts off the conversation. 

-Next day I decide to go back to the schedule I was used to bc it gives me more time. I go shower. I step out the bathroom and roommate is there and yells at me that I am being petty for going back to waking up at 6. I tell her that I am used to waking up at this time and there's no need for me to accomodate her since she's picky. She says I'm a bitch, I say that her shower issue is her problem and to wear earplugs then. 

-Argument breaks out, I go off to work. When I come back, roommate #3 asks what happened because the other roommate told her what's up. I explain my side, roommate #3 says I am 100 percent selfish in this issue. 

-Roommate #3 explains that I am the wrong one because I went back to showering at 6 when Roommate said the sound of the shower ruined her sleep and maybe she has a lot of work between college and her job. I say I shouldn't be accommodating if she thinks I should be making breakfast for everyone and if it disturbs my schedule. I don't complain when she showers. Roommate #3 says that this is exactly why I'm the selfish one/in the wrong because I'm not thinking of how the other roommate feels and I don't have sleep sensitivity so I can't say ""but I don't complain""

I went to bed and kinda thought it over. Idk. Reflecting on it, part of me feels bad for the possibility of waking her up by showering so early, but then I feel that it is ridiculous and there's no reason I should accomodate. Idk. Wanted to know what reddit thinks."
1495,anjixq,"WIBTA if I told my friends I’m dating my partner? I have been dating my SO for a little under a 2 months now. We agreed to keep it to ourselves for a bit at first, and that was fine. Now that’s it’s been a couple months, my friends have obviously noticed we spend a lot of time together. He has been around me and my friends before, and it’s clear that something is going on. Now, at this point, I don’t mind telling my friends. I would kind of prefer it. He came out to an engagement party with me and my friends and they joked about him seeing other people. I have to specify here, I really don’t believe there’s anything suspicious going on. But the fact that they assume he’s still seeing other people just rubbed me the wrong way. In his eyes, it would be funny if my friends thought we were only hooking up for as long as possible. He gives me no reason to believe he's cheating. He just finds it entertaining for some reason. My friends know that I have broken off things with my previous hook ups and keep asking me about our relationship status. It’s getting kinda uncomfortable to keep lying to my friends and make it seem like we’re not something when we are. I brought this up, but he insisted that we try to keep it up for as long as possible. I asked what I was supposed to do when they try to hook me up with some of their friends when we go out (which happens often), and he said at that point I should tell them.

On one hand, I don’t want to break any trust we have built up so early on, but on the same hand I’m not a big fan of lying to my friends especially when we’re so open with each other about our relationships. I also am not a big fan of the light this puts me in. In their eyes I have given up all my other hook ups and am tying myself to a person who is still seeing other people.

Just to clarify a few things, I have heard him on the phone with his step mom talking about me. He’s made it clear to her that we were in a relationship. So he’s not hiding the fact that we’re dating from his friends/family, just mine.

So, WIBTA for just telling my friends we’re dating? He really wants to keep this illusion going and doesn’t want me to ruin it. But I don’t want to be at a point where I’m stuck either flirting with someone at a bar or just admitting I’m in a relationship. Am I just being sensitive? It’s really harmless and otherwise, our relationship is perfectly fine. Of course I’ll bring it up again, but at this point if someone asks I’d rather just spill the beans."

Specially that ex-cop from Texas that shot the black guy in his apartment. Well, my co-workers are black and they stayed talking about race relations and how black people are treated poorly in America. They asked me for my input. I laughed and said ""Yeah, I'm gonna take a hard pass on that question."" 

They all laughed and moved on with a different topic except for one of them that started calling me a racist asshole. Am I an asshole for keeping my opinion too myself? This one guy seems to be the only one upset at it, but maybe the others just aren't voicing their opinion of me."
1497,e64mnh,"AITA for not returning to a successful project because my friend made it not fun? A year ago I started a podcast with my best friend of many years. It was my idea to start the podcast; I came up with the premise, the name, the logo, the branding. I set up all our podcasting networks and social media pages. I told them what recording software/microphone to get. I used my networking/social media presence to get us off the ground. Basically, I did all the heavy lifting since my friend had never done anything like this before and I had.

It's VERY important to note that this podcast was started as something to do as a fun project with my friend. This was never intended to make us famous or make us money. Yes, we discussed this.

Well, the podcast took off. Not hugely successful or anything, but enough to get my friend excited. Within a few months they wanted to start a ""schedule"" and record specific nights at specific times so we could have episodes ready to release on a, in their words, ""professional and timely manner."" I was a little surprised as I didn't consider this to be a ""professional"" endeavor but whatever.

Fast forward. We'd record for over 2 hours every other week on my one of two days I had free after work, leaving me with only one day a week free to do things for myself. Every attempt to skip or reschedule resulted in anger and frustration from my friend. Soon my friend starts asking me for designs for ""merch"" and wants to sell hoodies for our podcast at $45 a pop. Not to mention we covered some sensitive topics and I occasionally disagreed with how they handled/addressed them.

I had a really rough summer and wasn't in the best headspace to treat this as a second job, which is what my friend expected. It became something I dreaded and my participation suffered, and it showed. My friend asked me to ""take a break"" because I was ""making us look bad.""

I did take a break and it was like a weight lifted off my shoulders. Meanwhile my friend did whatever they wanted to do with the podcast, including more things I disagreed with. After a few months I was asked (not even by my friend, but by someone else they knew!) if I was returning. I said no and that I wasn't in the best place to return but that my friend was fully capable of handling it themselves.

The next day I was removed as an admin from all the social media sites... you know, the ones I set up?

So, AITA for not returning to the podcast, as well as not wanting to be friends with this person anymore? I feel like my fun project (that was essentially my baby) turned into an un-fun cash cow and while I'm relieved to not be part of it anymore, I'm also pissed that it was taken away from me after all my hard work."
1498,el8rza,"AITA for putting a “please pick up your dog poop, you’re on camera” sign in my front yard? They ripped the sign up I have no idea whose dog has been doing this, if it’s a loose dog from someone’s house in the neighborhood (which is gated), or if it’s someone walking their dog and letting it poop on my lawn. The poop isn’t from a tiny dog either, the poop is almost human sized or bigger, it’s from a massive dog. It’s happened at least 10 times and the other day I stepped in it and tracked it into my garage. The poop completely ruined my sandals, I had to throw them away. To make matters worse, I have two small dogs who are a month behind on their vaccines (although I have a vet appointment coming up) and I don’t want them to get a disease from the dog poop, I’m just so sick of having dog poop in my yard. It’s not near the curb either, it’s almost always against my front window or front door. I wrote a sign (the title of this post, even though I don’t have a camera) and a few hours later when I came home, the paper was ripped up. I thought maybe an animal destroyed the paper, but now I’m second guessing if someone did it? Also the other day, a bunch of feathers were all over my yard. I don’t know if it was from an actual dead bird, or if it was craft feathers or not, but I’m really started to get upset. Maybe the sign was passive aggressive of me, but I’m sick of this. Was I the asshole for writing the sign? There was a massive pile of poop there again today."

A few minutes ago he walked into the living room and told me he was releasing a parody album called ""Poop Shit"" and I started laughing because that's ridiculous. He began mocking me, saying that it was a litmus test, and that I am his intellectual inferior for finding that funny.

1500,eq30i6,"WIBTA if I requested my roommates significant other start contributing to rent Throwaway because privacy 

So my roommate, their significant other, and I have all know each other for years. They have been dating for years. I’ll call my roommate X and they’re significant other Y. I’ve always gotten along with both X and Y and we haven’t had any large arguments. 

However, Y has been basically living in our house for the past several months. I say basically because Y has their own home with family but does not like their family or being home. Y spends almost every night and all free time at our house. They keep groceries at our house, has moved in a significant amount of their things, help cook and clean, etc. 

My problem with this comes in with the fact that Y acts like they live in our house rather than a guest. Y has chastised me multiple times for things like not doing dishes, not taking the recycling out, etc. I understand that I am not the perfect roommate at all. I can be a bit messy at times, (in my opinion thought, Y is a bit of neat freak, they prefer things to be completely picked up, wiped down, and very organized at all times). I try to be considerate and do try to take care of my share of responsibilities around the house. I know I slack on it sometimes but I have two jobs and am out of town a lot when I’m not working. 

Y also isn’t always this most considerate person, they can have a tendency to be rather loud while they know I’m doing work, moving my items around the house cause they don’t like where I put them, etc. 

This is frustrating because I know for a fact Y has much more free time, prefers to have things much cleaner, and helps X significantly and does a lot of their responsibilities around the house. 

My point is Y gets on my case about responsibilities around the house and acts like they live there. It irks me to no end that they do this and don’t even contribute to rent/utilities. 

When I told my sibling they said that Y should be contributing finically to the house if they want to act like they live their. 

But I’m worried I could be the AH considering how much they do around the house in terms of chores."
1501,e61v6p,"WIBTA for leaving my best friend of three years? I’m using a throwaway because i am worried she knows my main account.

Very recently I have found out that my best friend of three years has been shit talking me behind my back (multiple occasions with multiple people) and spreading (untrue) rumours about me within our circle of friends. She also has started verbally putting me down and making rude comments to me to the point where i have become extremely insecure about my personality and appearance. She also owes over  $200 to various people, including myself. Which she refuses to pay back.

However my friend has also had a lot of trouble in her life and a series of misfortunes like family struggles as well as guy trouble (bad boyfriends and the like). She also says that she is broke, however we go shopping a lot together and she buys a lot of unnecessary things, such as the james Charles eyeshadow palette ($50), even though she already has other eyeshadow palettes as well as many clothing items. I know she is extremely insecure about herself and is likely taking her insecurities out on other people.

This insecurity and taking it out on people has always been there a little bit but it has never been this bad (got worse a couple months ago). It has gotten to the point where I am considering stopping talking to her but I am worried it is the wrong move considering how long we have been friends. WIBTA for ceasing contact with her?"
1502,cfggse,"AITA for telling my mother that my sister was going to buy a snake and hide it in her bedroom? This happened about 10 minutes ago but I'm still pissed.

For background my sister (21F) got into a huge fight with my parents a few weeks ago and they gave her two weeks to find an apartment and gtfo. She called them a bunch of names and told them to go fuck themselves even tho they were only angry cause she never did the laundry. She found an apartment and is moving in in about two weeks.

Now to today. My parents were outside talking when my sister came up to me (16M) and told me that she was getting a snake. I said okay, when? She has been wanting on for a long time but my parents won't let her. She said that she is getting it tommorow and keeping it in her room. I told her it was a shit idea and to just wait until she moves out. She said they are on sale or something tomorrow so she has to do it now. When I asked the other details she said she will-

Hide the tank in her room and hope my parents never walk in and see it (they would)

And hide the frozen mice in the bottom of our freezer. (We have a huge chest freezer that is full of meat. This wouldn't work because my parents dig around in it daily.)

I brought up my concerns and she said ""Fuck (our parents) I don't care what they say."" I kept telling her to just wait til she moved out but she blew me off so when my mom walked in a few minutes late I told her my sister's plan. She was, of course, angry. My mom said that's not fucking happening. 

I would also like to say that she really can't afford a pet. She barely had the money to move out. None of us know where all her cash goes but she is living paycheck to paycheck.

My sister is absolutely pissed at me for ratting her out but still thinks she is gonna get a snake tomorrow. My mom is on my side and is glad I told her. I feel kinda bad but knew that my sister was doing something that would only make the situation worse. AITA?"

I visited him almost every week while he did time, and said he could stay at my place when he got out until he figured out housing through his parole. I also warned that it wasn't my obligation to do this, and it'd be over when I saw fit.

About 3 days in he was out somewhere and broke curfew. I texted him, said he'd be back soon. About an hour later he showed up to my place blind drunk. I told him to grab his things and leave. He was too drunk to even get his shit together to do that.

I locked him out of my house but he wouldn't leave. Just yelled and pounded on the door.

Finally I called the cops to come pick him up, even though I knew this could violate his probation.

I haven't heard from him and I'm not sure what ended up happening.

1506,aollew,"AITA for arguing with my mom over shaving my arms? To start off, I am not old enough to move out so I am currently dependent on my mom.

I love my mom. She’s very hardworking and she does care for me. While we usually get along okay, we are both sometimes very stubborn people. I know from experience that my mom will absolutely not back down on even the smallest disagreements. 



She told me earlier that she didn’t want me to shave my arms. I listen to my mom and I obey her every single day. I’ll make dinner when she tells me to, I’ll clean when she tells me to, I keep up with my studies and I am generally honest and respectful to her. But for me this was going too far because it’s my body and shaving my arms will have 0 impact on my future. 

I told her that I shave my arms to feel more comfortable with myself. She accused me of wanting to conform to society, and that “God” created me so that I can be myself. I replied back asking if that was the case, then why does my mom always wax her eyebrows and pluck her unwanted facial hair. She told me facial hair is okay but arm hair isn’t. I asked her why since their the same thing. 

It went back and forth like that for a long time and things got really heated. She told me that I’m an ungrateful daughter and I never listen to anything she said, she said in the future I’ll be drinking and smoking and going completely off the rail. 

I understand her argument. Her house, her rules. But I feel like as a mother she rarely ever takes my interests into heart. She’s happy and complacent whenever I tell her about my achievements but she’ll never go out of her way to let me have something that would make ME happy. With her it’s always like, what would SHE want, what would SHE like to be happy, and it’s so exhausting that I wish for once she’d let me have one thing I want that isn’t necessary or that she feels obligated to do as a parent. 

So AITA? Should I obey her or assert my own boundaries? 

Thank you so much in advance. "
1507,dntdse,"AITA for asking my parents to turn down their music? My parents love to party, but it interferes a lot with my schedule. Often times they go out to the bar and get home late with friends they bring home. They'll usually be up for a few hours playing music and having a good time. It can get loud because my bedroom is right above the living room where they hang out. I'm a super light sleeper so it's hard for me to try to fall asleep during this. I've tried putting on some sleep meditation or wearing earplugs but it's still extremely loud. The music and their voices literally vibrate the floor and make it impossible to fall asleep.

I'm 22 and I live at home. I'm not in a place where I'm able to move out as I only work 3 days a week at a minimum wage job and go to school full time. They have told me multiple times that they want me to stay at home until I finish school to save money. I'm really appreciative of that. When they got home at 1 am I tried to ignore them but ended up having to say something a few hours later because I had work soon and wanted to at least try to get a few hours of sleep.

I went downstairs at 5 am to see if they could turn the music down. I pulled them aside to talk to them, but my mom was absolutely plastered and yelled in response loud enough that everyone could hear. My mom said that it wasn't my place to say anything, and that I'm not allowed to tell her what to do in her own house. I went back upstairs and didn’t push any more.

I was supposed to be at work 30 minutes ago, but I had to call out. I can't function without sleep. I have a job where I need to be very awake and alert at all times. I would have been worse off going into my job than staying home. I hate calling out of work, and I had to last week for being sick which was a valid reason, but this doesn't feel like one. I went outside over an hour ago to smoke a cigarette while I called my boss. Afterwards my dad came out and apologized to me. He said he didn't mean for everybody to be up this long and he didn't know that I had work and would pay me back for what I missed out on making today. I said he didn't have to do that; it just sucks that I had to call out twice in a week and that it makes me look bad.

My mom is still really mad at me. When I went back inside to get some water, she said I embarrassed her in front of her friends, and I had no right to say anything to them. My 15 year old brother came into my room in the middle of the night frustrated as well due to a lack of sleep, and because he has a soccer game this afternoon, which my parents are clearly now unable to bring him to. I'm sad that I upset my mom and don't want her to be mad at me for crossing any lines, but I’m still aggravated that I’ve been up 9 hours too long and had to call out of work. I don't know how to feel. I'm annoyed and processing everything in my exhausted state. Am I the asshole for saying something? Should I have let it be?"
1508,dqoia0,"AITA for still being mad my BF's friend was mean to me? My (32F) partner (30M) has lots of friends, while I only have a few close friends. One group of his is particularly uninviting, centering around 1 woman who is mean. I don't say this lightly; this is a known thing. Before I met her for the 1st time, my bf texted her to be nice to me. It didn't work. She continually made passive aggressive, demeaning, or belittling comments and made no effort to make me feel welcome. This went on for 6 months. BF and I would fight about her about every \~2 weeks until he had a sit down w/her and FINALLY told her her behavior was unacceptable. She acknowledged this behavior (though I suspect she thought I was too stupid to notice the intent of ALL of her comments, as she thinks she's the smartest in the room), and even said this wasn't the first time she's gotten this feedback.

This was \~1.5 years ago; she has since been cordial to me in group settings, and he has cut down the time he spends w/her. (And bc my bf is not one to rock the boat, this meant seeing the whole group less bc he refused to invite some friends to things but not her. He knows she is not welcome in our home.) But here's the rub: she has never apologized to me, even though she's acknowledged her shitty behavior (to my bf). Every time I have to be around her my stomach twists into a knot of anxiety and rage. And when my bf spends time w/her alone, I get furious. It feels like he is betraying me. So we fight, and it blows up and he tells me I need to ""get over it"" and defends her by saying how ""perfectly cordial"" she was to me the last time I saw her. Now I can't even have a reaction when he mentions her bc he will threaten ""do you want me to scream at you and be mad at you for the rest of the day?"" I get so angry that instead of yelling at the person who actually did shitty things (when I did nothing wrong; she started being mean about 10 min. into our 1st dinner) he's yelling at me. Being ""perfectly cordial"" is having basic manners and is the least we should expect from everyone.

We've been going through a rough patch recently (sleeping in separate bedrooms) and he's been hanging out with her and the rest of the dickish friend group a lot more. They're the only ones on his side who know about our issues. (I call them dickish bc they've been friends w/her so long I don't think they can recognize when she does shitty things and think she's normal. Apparently she/they iced out a different friend's now-fiancee for 2 years before she was ""accepted"" into the group.) I don't want our only interactions right now to be fights, since the relationship is on edge, but I feel really hurt and can't seem to let this go. If it were up to me, he would cut her out of his life completely, but I know that's not an option. Do I need to just ""get over it"" or am I right to still be really pissed?

TL;DR: my bf has a friend who bullied me for 6 mos and never apologized, and I am supposed to ""get over it."""
1509,bz4alz,"AITA for making fun of my GF’s brother about his money? Recently my GF (ashley)’s cousin got married so she invited me to go to her wedding with her. At the reception we were seated with Ashleys mom and dad, and her brother (steve) and his fiancee.

Basically to add info to the situation, my GF has a lot of student debt and works in a field that doesn’t pay super well. Her brother works in a blue collar job that is fairly manual but he gets paid really well, and recently got a promotion so he gets paid even more now. I make around a similar amount of money to him, but he constantly tries to make jabs about how his money is hard earned whereas I work in an office (and so does Ashley)

I want to also preface that I poke fun at Steve a lot, and typically its pretty well received by him, and he will toss jokes back and its typically all good fun. I don’t have an actual brother so he’s basically the closest thing to this type of relationship I have.

Well back to the situation, we were having a chat at the reception dinner at our table, and Steve asks Ashley how much she gave in her card. She says $200 (which honestly she doesn’t really have to just go handing out, so I covered half of that). So basically with this grin on his face Steve goes “heh well I put in $300” as if it even mattered how much each person gave. So me being supportive/protective of my GF, who is fairly sensitive to things like this, sarcastically say “hey everyone look at me, I’m a big manager now, look how much money I’ve got”.

While most people at the table laughed at this, Steve was very upset and called me an asshole and got up and left the table. Their parents assured me he was just being a baby and that he could “dish it but couldn’t take it”.

Steve didn’t really talk to me the rest of the night and I didn’t really make an effort to apologize. I felt like he was basically trying to make my GF feel bad that she can’t afford to give as much as he can. He does this stuff to me occasionally, or at least tries to but it doesn’t bother me because I make similar money, but my GF obviously isn’t comfortable. The incident didn’t affect the actual wedding but I kinda felt bad that I embarrassed him in front of his family, but at the same time whats there to be sensitive about when he’s the one flaunting how much he is making to someone he knows doesn’t make as much.

This is my husbands and my first child after struggling with infertility for 2 years. I want to invite friends and long-term coworkers so I told my Mom we could do a joint one as long as I could invite my friends. I already was on the fence about this because I would love my own baby shower since it's our first but I don't want to hurt my Moms feelings and have family come into town more than once. She told me that I could invite 5 people, but only 5 because she doesn't want her house over run with strangers. So I told her no, and she is upset with me saying she wanted to enjoy this experience together. Idk what to do!! AITA?

Update: I think I am going to go ahead and do a family shower with my mother and friends shower on my own. The only issue left is my husbands family. There are at least 10+ women in his family I would need to invite so I guess I will have to invite them to the 2nd friends shower."

We have been arguing quite a bit lately because I don’t want to have his last name as my own. It’s 13 letters long, has 5 syllables and is very hard to pronounce. Perhaps I’m being petty, but I don’t and have never liked his last name. He knows that I’m not too fond of his last name, too.

I’ve brought up the option to keep my own last name after we get married. However, my fiancé has said numerous times that this makes him feel like we’re not actually getting married. He brought up how people will always think we’re just girlfriend and boyfriend, not an actual married couple.

I therefore suggested that he have my maiden name instead, to which he said that it was a stupid idea and that men don’t take their wife’s last name. We’re both not religious, but he said that this wasn’t traditional. When I tried to talk about this further he got angry with me, asking me if I truly loved him and wanted to marry him. I was so shocked that he asked me that.

I've rushed up there a few times after he got home to spend time with him.  But now if I don't or I don't call him right away, he says I don't love him.

On top of this, I found out today he has been drinking and driving. He always claims it is ""just one"" but he has been in 3 accidents since December. He also always blames the other party and says they just drive away. This seems very suspicious to me.

Part of me is sad but the other part is so angry, I don't want to speak to him.

1513,cv1pbl,"AITA For not showing up at my best friend's wedding? Background:

I've known my best friend for about 20 years. I also know his soon-to-be wife since they day they've met (i was there, going to town with him when he met her), which is about 15 years ago.

In the past 15 years we had a lot of fun together, talked to each other a lot and i got to know her really good, but i always had my reservations about her, which i've shared with him.

My opinion of her now is even more doubtful, because she always smokes a lot of weed (really too much) and beying unemployed for years and i could see that has an impact on her. I didn't mention that just to keep the peace.

Now they've had a child, and my best friend is crazy about him, that's good to see. he even gave up smoking cigarettes.

His to-be-wife is still being a drunkard and smoking weed all day, and being unemployed.

They have plans to get married this year.

&#x200B;

In the meanwhile, i was married with someone who turned about to be really toxic, and i'm still in a divorce with her for over a year. she really mistreated me physically and emotionally. 

It was so horrible that at a certain moment i had to run out of my own house, call the cops, wait for them to be able to get my own belonings, and go somewhere else.

I went to the couple mentioned earlier. rang on their doorbell at 03:00 and told them the story.

Spend a couple of days with them, they were really friendly at that moment.

&#x200B;

Fast forward a few months:

I'm divorced, and it turned out that she, and my to-be ex-wife are getting to be really good friends.

Turned out, what they told me, that they also invited my ex-wife for their wedding ceremony and the party afterwards.

When i learned that, i told them that i wouldn't be there wherever my ex-wife is, meaning the ceremony and the party.

I told them: I'm afraid what could happen, either i'll break down crying when i see her, or i'll smash her out of a window

They told me to ""Just deal with it""

I Just can't understand what those people are thinking. ofcourse it's their wedding and you want to expect that everyone behaves, but on the other had i expected some loyalty for knowing each other for over 15 years and being toughtfull enough not to invite my ex-wife.

Am i the asshole for saying, ""I'm not going to your wedding"" ?"
1514,c9iy5b,"AITA for not giving my niece money for graduation? [reposted because of word limit]

throwaway because they use Reddit

TL:DR - read the title

Last month, my niece visited for three weeks.  She's a huge fan of a particular show, ""Future"".  I had never seen it, so we planned that while she visited, we'd binge watch the entire series (100+ episodes) together.  I even took 2 weeks off of work.  She just graduated high school, so I took her to Red Lobster to celebrate (her choice out of the admittedly small number of restaurants I could afford).  I thought we had a blast.

Yesterday, my sister called me. She said, “I have to talk to you. And I’m telling you because I’d want to know if I were you.  When Niece left your house, she went to visit Aunt Pam, who gave her $500.""  Pam is her aunt from dad's side.

“That’s great. I’m sure she was happy,” I said.  ??

“Niece said that Aunt Pam was the only one to give her money in the entire family. So I was thinking that you could give Niece some money, and just say that you forgot. I know it’s not a competition, but I’m making it one,” my sister says.

I’m a cashier. Aunt Pam lives in California and is an architect. Granted, Aunt Pam is a single mom, but I am 100% certain that she’s more financially secure than I am. In a financial competition, I will lose, every time.

I do have savings I could dip into. But that savings is the result of living a very sparse life. I don’t have a car, or a cell phone. I don’t go to restaurants.  I rely on DVDs from the library instead of a streaming service like Netflix or Amazon. I haven’t gotten new clothes in 15 years. 

My sister and her daughter don’t understand.  All they see is that I have savings (meant for emergencies).  My behavior to get to those savings - they just see as ""eccentric behavior"".

Even with all that, I could afford to give Niece $50 or so. But I am really uncomfortable with the whole idea. If my sister had brought this up before Niece visited, I wouldn’t have had a problem giving it to her. But now it seems as if I’m paying to be a member of that family. And there’s no way my niece will believe I “forgot”. She will pick up that I was “told” to give her money, and that kind of ruins it in my mind.

And I have to say, I’m incredibly hurt that those 3 weeks we spent together meant less to Niece than money would. I took 2 weeks off of work. Would it have been better to just work those 2 weeks, not spend time with Niece, and hand Niece the money from that? 

So I guess my question is this: Should I suck it up and give my niece money anyway? (I have a feeling my sister will not see $50 as enough, though, especially since she deems it a “competition”.) Maybe my niece won’t care that I was told to give her money. Maybe she’d just rather have the money no matter how she got it. Maybe I should count my niece graduating as one of those “emergency expenses” that I save money for, and give her $500. You only graduate high school once."
1515,bz1fal,"AITA for parking on residential roads? So backstory, I work at a hospital doing research into breast cancer detection. I am only working there for a year. I live about 30 mins drive away, and public transport here is a mess and is very expensive (£10+ a day). So, I drive, but I cannot afford to pay to park at the hospital (£16+ a day) and I don't qualify for a permit. 
There's a few residential streets about a 10-15 minute walk from where I work, so I park there. I try to park somewhere different every day, so I don't annoy any one person, and I do my best to find streets that have driveways so I know that the person has somewhere to park their own car. 
So today I park up and walk to work. I come back, and I've been blocked in, like someone right up my rear, cm from my boot. I knock on the door of the person I assume the van belongs to, to politely ask them to move, and they answer the door. I don't get a chance to open my mouth before this middle aged man starts shouting and swearing at me about how I've parked in front of his driveway ( I hadn't) and how he wants to come home from work and park outside his house (he has 3 cars always in his driveway so it's full, but he has a van which was parked on the road). 
He had plenty of room behind him, as the only person he would be obstructing is more of his own driveway, but he obviously wanted to come out and scream at a 22 year old girl in the pouring rain while I cried my eyes out and didn't manage to even say hello. 
I get that it's annoying and if I was going to be working at the hospital full time for the next unknown number of years I would try harder to get a permit, but I'm here less than a year.

Usually I’ll shoot him a text asking where he went, and he’ll usually say he’ll be back in a couple hours or so. But sometimes he won’t come back when he says he would. He also does things like say that he’ll come over at 3, and then show up 5 hours later than he says he would.

When I call him out on it, he’ll say that he’s not my boyfriend/he gets enough shit from his ex-wife/that none of his other friends complain when he does it. Am I blowing this out of proportion? It’s getting to the point that I’m almost ready to give up on him."
1517,dwvsgp,"AITA for kicking my roommate out? I live in a 2 bed, 2 bath apartment with 3 other people — so 2 people in each bedroom. Our lease started in June, and some of us went on summer vacations here and there through August, including my roommate. The problem arose when I Venmo charged her for her share of August utility bills, she essentially ignored it and didn’t say anything to me. We’re all college students and money can be tight sometimes, so I gave her the benefits of the doubt. But then she also didn’t pay her September bills except for rent. Then October bills came and the same thing happened. 

Finally she texted me last week and said that she wanted to talk about the August utility bills. She claimed that since she was away for 2 weeks in August and 1 week in September, she should only have to pay half of what I charged her. It didn’t feel fair because the rest of us also went away for weeks at a time but we still paid for our share in full. 

She also doesn’t contribute to other household supplies; she never buys toilet paper, hand soap, dish soap, etc. The first 5ing she said when she moved in was “Can I borrow you guys’s pots and pans to make some food? And plates and utensils?” 

The bills became the last straw for me so over the weekend, I asked her to move out and gave her a month to look for a new place. She started crying, saying that it’s the middle of the school year and it would be difficult to find a place but I stood firm. Am I the asshole?"

You couldn’t afford payments on a truck like that” (It’s a 2019 3500 diesel dually gmc, $85k truck, but it pays itself off for the work I do, and I need a large reliable truck) That got me angry and I explained to them that I don’t get any financial support from my parents, I am an equipment operator/mechanic for logging, which the pay is good, and I need the truck for work.(they probably think just because I’m young means I can’t afford nice things, not my fault everyone there decided to go to college) None of them believed me and everyone just started ripping on me, so I told my girlfriend I was going to leave, and she was begging me to stay, but I told her she can stay but I’m not going to sit here getting ripped on by everyone, and she said fine.

Within days of placing an order, he always starts to get angry that it is being slow. Tons and tons of offensive emails to me. Calling me a scammer etc. He has always got his work, so I don't know why he thinks I am a scammer.

I decided I didn't want to work with him anymore, so I offered him a refund. He refused. Said if I refunded, it had to be $2000 (he paid $45) because that is how much it would cost to get somebody that offers the same quality of work that i do.  He said if I just refunded the $45, he would leave negative reviews about me online. So, I thought i'd just leave it. I couldn't really win. He clearly wanted the content, so i'd string him out.

As a note: he was meant to pay $450 for the content. He only ever sent $45 as I typoed in the email. He normally pays $45. The result would be working for less than $2 an hour. I didn't really want to do it.

He then sends abusive messages every single day. Says I am a rich man stealing his hard-earned cash (I am not), and says FUCK YOU in every email. EVERY EMAIL.

When an argument got heated around the topic I decided to side with the guy, don’t get me wrong he isn’t perfect, he’s abit shy and antisocial but he didn’t deserve to be cheated on.

I and her have been good friend for years and our families are close so when she got home she told her father and he had a stern word with me, I explained the situation to him and he was sympathetic but he said that I should apologise to her due to her being depressed for a year (not medically diagnosed mind you).

1522,eb6adi,"AITA for telling my friend's boyfriend that my friend is cheating on him? Hello, everyone. The problem here is that my friend is cheating on her boyfriend and she asked me about my opinion in the case. 

Yesterday my friend asked me to go to her house because her boyfriend was out of the town, so I went there just to watch some movies and eat pizza with her. So, in the middle of the movie she told me that she had to tell me a really serious thing, so I just waited and listened to her.

She kept trying to make this not a big deal, but when she told me that she was cheating on her boyfriend (they are in a relationship for like three years by now and he wanted to propose to her on Reveillon) and she needed me to be honest with her about what I thought, I was just, like... What the actual fuck?

I told her that she was being a bitch for doing this to a guy that helped her in the most sad part of her life: when her dad abandoned her, her mother and her sister all by themselves. Like, he's not an angel and maybe he's doing something that pisses her off, but it's not worth to cheat on a guy like this. 

So, I left her house after we had a fight about me being more friend of her boyfriend than hers. I told her that no matter what happened I wasn't going to leave her because she means a lot to me, but it was not for her to expect me to just forget about it and go on with my life. Like, I CAN'T. Her boyfriend is a human being and he deserves a girlfriend that loves him more than anything. 

When I arrived to my house, I started to call her boyfriend and when I told him what was going on, he started to cry and now I know that my friend hates me more than anything. I know that maybe I shouldn't done it, but I would like to know if someone's cheating on me. Her sister called me and told me that I was the reason for them to break up. My mother told me that I had good intentions, but just made things worse. And I don't know what to say now. I feel like I'm a fucking bitch too.

1524,et8mnf,"WIBTA for cutting a friendship over a suggestive picture? (And potentially making him lose a lot of friends) A few years ago I (18 F) Met ""Jeff"" (19 M). We hit it off right away and began ""dating"" (it was never official) after a few months we broke up (long distance wasn't working) and saw different people. A year goes by and we're both single again so we decide to get back together (distance wasn't a problem anymore). Once again we ""dated"" for a few months and broke up, again. This cycle went on for the better part of our relationship until we both decided enough was enough and left it at being friends. Well this changed into FWB for a while which promptly ended once we went to our respective college. Jeff and I are also part of a club where we share a very close mutual friend group. my friendship with Jeff has always been complicated at best. Background over.

So I ended up meeting my current boyfriend ""mark"" at college and so far it's been going great. I told Jeff that I'm in a committed relationship and I've been very clear to Jeff that I don't see him in a romantic way anymore. During this conversation  Jeff also asked me if we could do some fwb things ""like old times"" to which I said no and left it at that. 

Everything was fine until Jeff sent me a picture of him in a suggestive pose and caption on it (this was about a week ago). The picture itself wasn't indecent, just suggestive. It made me feel very uncomfortable (which I expressed) and we both decided to pretend like it never happened. Before he did this he also asked if I was still dating Mark which I told him yes.

Now this probably sounds like a validation post but this is where I feel like an asshole. I told Mark about the situation and he said that it's up to me what I do. Jeff and I been friends for a long time despite the complications and it always sucks to lose friends. However I realize this has happened twice and it makes me extremely uncomfortable, I'm also worried it will happen again if we remain friends. On the other hand if I cut ties with him that would most likely start drama in our friend group and that means people would choose sides. This would mean Jeff might lose more friendships and I'd feel bad for causing that. At the same time I don't think I can handle it happening again. So WIBTA?

She has caused a lot of trauma in my life, but when I wasn’t living with her our relationship was okay. She stopped talking to me a few times, once because of not giving her my social security number and another time was because I wouldn’t pay for her move and move her entire apartment when my now husband and I were moving.
I became pregnant and she seemed really happy about it. She never visited, even though it was only an hour drive, but would always write on Facebook like she was a huge part in my pregnancy.
This bothered me, but not worth fighting about. She became super upset when I told her she wasn’t allowed in the delivery room and threw a fit when she found out my father in law happened to be the one who drove me when I was in Labor. 
She came to visit my daughter once after she was born, she was okay around her. She then tried to visit when my father came (they are divorced and he lives in a different country) she got mad again when I told her she isn’t taking time away from him and his granddaughter. 
One day she was mad at me and I found out she was telling people I was drinking and allowing my daughter to play with the bottles (I don’t drink). I then told her she is to not be a part of my daughters life and blocked her on Facebook so she has no access to her photos. 
I’ve been told many times that it was too harsh and it’s the only grandchild and isn’t fair. Am I the asshole for trying to put my nugget first?

During one of her team’s meetings the CEO came in and called her out for not hitting benchmarks in front of the whole team and said she was being transferred for basically not performing well. Shitty thing to do. Personally I think dressing down employees should be done in private. My girlfriend is not at all happy with her new position and feels she was unfairly treated since some coworkers were similarly underperforming but are more qualified (my girlfriend and I are both working on getting our masters now). A day has not gone by since this ordeal that she hasn’t told me how terrible the CEO, programs and company overall are. 

My girlfriend told me yesterday that if I plan on going to the holiday party next month I would upset her and she would not speak to me due to feeling betrayed. I told her that is unreasonable to ask and that it’s controlling and borderline emotional abuse to try to ban me from going. 

I don’t particularly want to go but it’s expected of supervisors to attend and it is a good opportunity for me to show appreciation to my boss and the employees I supervise. I was only planning on going for an hour or so before leaving.

I have an aunty who has a bad reputation for being a pretty crappy mother because of the way she handles situations, or lack there of. I hate having her over my house as her youngest child (5 or 6) is aggressive and doesn't listen to anybody especially his mother. He's been diagnosed with ADHD but she doesn't want to use the medications she's recieved because she doesn't like how he 'doesn't act himself'. The kid has serious problems besides ADHD, he's been forced out of school from aggessive behaviour such as shoving plastic knives and forks down children's mouths, hitting his teachers, and he also squished one of the schools chickens which had to be put down. In a moment of genius, she adopted a kitten which he immediately used as his new play thing. Its been months since the kitten has moved in with me and she is such an affectionate cat but hides whenever he is here. Words cannot describe this childs behaviour towards animals and humans.

Along with her other 3 children, she has no control of the household. I'm sick of having to look after her children and worry about whether they're getting into places they shouldn't be while I am at my own house trying to enjoy a bbq. The youngest child is such a handful and almost broke my finger from twisting it around, he continuously pushes me and punches me whenever he's around and if he doesn't get his own way he'll fake cry to his mother who insists we go and do what he wants. We trashes the house and abuses all the other kids and adults there, but the mother just relaxes and drinks our wine.

There is so much to talk about on this that it's so hard to not keep mentioning stuff without repeating myself. Basically, the kid doesn't care about anybody else and the mother only gives a damn about her children and herself but can't tell the kids off when they're in the wrong. I have stories for days about this kid.

When I was 21, I got sick of living at home because my brother contributed nothing to the family and made everything hell. I moved out of home, and rented a shitty place for a few years. I had a decent savings from working a job that was in my study field at uni.


Around the time of me thinking of buying a house (when I was 25) my mum told me my brother decided to get married ??? (never met the girl before), and that the wife was going to move into the rental my mum's been looking after.


I decided to buy a small 1x1x1 flat for my mum, let her live there so she didn't need to worry so much about keeping a roof over her head (she doesn't have a decent job and was an immigrant, my dad gambled the money away before they divorced). This house was under the agreement that she stopped helping my brother and started taking care of herself.


Fast forward to six months ago, brother is now divorced, and moved all his things into my house. I talked to my mum, and she feels guilty about the situation. I told her I would sell the house if she doesn't tell him to move out. 


She cooks for him, cleans after him. He goes to work, plays video games, and doesn't pay rent or contribute to the utilities. I'm at the end here, I gave up purchasing a house for myself so she'd be okay, and now she's gone to the same thing that led me to move out when I was 21.


TLDR: WIBTA if I sold the house and told them to fend for themselves if he doesn't leave?


INFO: I own the house, paid off the mortgage. Mum pays the utilities with her part time job. When she got too old to work, I had planned on moving her into a granny flat on my property (if I manage to secure a good piece of land), or exchanging that small flat into a ""seniors"" village, where there was support when needed.


INFO: reason why I want to kick them out - this enabling behaviour is the reason I left 8 years ago. I didn't want any part in him leeching from my mum, now it annoys me that the one agreement I put in place so mum could enjoy hobbies is more or less ruined. If he had no money for rent, but cooked and cleaned half the time - I'd have no problems with him staying there.w

I painted them and loaded them into the closet. 

Rehearsal starts and the boxes aren’t out. I ask the other parent if she could help me grab them. She says we should wait until we have more help. I acquiesce and sit down. 

Ten minutes later the director and assistant director ask for the boxes to be brought out. She responded with “We can’t do it” 

I say, “WE? I CAN get them.” And I get up to get them myself. She hops up and looks at me and says, 

“What is your problem?” 

I responded with, “you said ‘We’ I can get them. It isn’t a problem.” 

She then says “why are you being so aggressive? What is your problem, why are you being so aggressive?”

I said, “Really it isn’t a problem I can grab the boxes” she follows me and tells me she got a pinched neck from lifting the boxes and we should wait. I start moving the boxes and she say, “see they are heavy” I reassured her that I put them there, I can take them down. 

She keeps yelling. I tell her we need to step outside. That it isn’t appropriate to yell in front of the kids. 

We go outside. She tells me again that I am being too aggressive and that I need apologize to her. I don’t apologize. I tell her we need to talk it out first. She then says what is your problem today? Why are you so aggressive. 

I say, “you said I wasn’t strong enough.” She cuts me off. She was right, she didn’t say that. 

I say, “you need to calm down” we can talk about this. She again tells me I need to apologize. I said once we are calm we can talk about it. 

I walk away. I return to the room another way, and see her come in *aggressively* and take her son, grab his costume and leave. 

We are less than a month out from the play and she isn’t returning people’s phone calls or texts. 

I told the leadership if it helps, I can back away so she feels more comfortable. I don’t want the poor boy to not participate, but I really wasn’t expecting her to leave. 

Did I embarrass her by telling her we have to step outside and that this wasn’t appropriate in front of kids, or was I the Asshole for not apologizing when she was yelling at me to.

He asked my friend for sexual favours once ""as a joke"" but its made our friendship strained. Most of the time he's really nice, but one on one, it's just really uncomfortable. He makes sexually suggestive jokes about me, and insists on hugging me when we leave, which i'm not comfortable with, I don't hug hardly any of my other friends, and even then only after years of knowing them. He also made out with one of my friends without asking her when she didn't want to, at a party. He was sober and she was not. **In short, he is overly sexual with me, but not in a way that i can call him out on for an specific instance. I have not reciprocated any of his advances**

I'm on holiday at the moment, and told all of my friends that i will not be texting anyone during this time (this isn't unusual, i like my space to decompress). But he was REALLY insistent that i ""have to text him"" or he'll worry. i said that i wouldnt and he tried to pressure me into texting him more. i really felt dodgy about how he was speaking to me, so i left. He has now texted me asking how I am (he instigates all the texts), and I haven't responded. AITA?"
1531,a9vsto,"AITA for breaking up with my girlfriend I (18M) have been with my GF (18F) for about a year now. At first things were great, it was my first relationship and I was excited to finally have all these moments and share experiences with a girl that I really liked. However, things started to change around the last month or so. Hanging out started to feel like a job and less like something that was fun. My GF and I hung out for around 4 hours almost every day, and I did enjoy the times that we were together. But, things would go down the drain once I went back to my house and the day was over. One of my favorite things to do was to get online and play games with some friends after hanging out, however, she would take it as though I am ignoring her and she would accuse me of ""hating her"", to which I'd reply that I don't and then all of a sudden a fight over text would break out.  It blew me away since it was such a 180 from what she was feeling earlier that day. This would occur every other day for a couple of days until I told her that it was a problem. She understood and stopped doing it for that time being. 

&#x200B;

Then came last week Friday. Her and I had another date on Thursday, and she told me that we might not be able to hang out all day because she has something to do in the evening. I said that it's totally okay and that we can hangout Saturday. But, she said that we can still hangout on early morning on Friday. I said okay to that too and I went home. Well, Friday morning comes by and I wake up to no one home but my sister. This was around 9 so I assumed my parents were gone and so I had to watch my sister until someone came back. I played games for the time being, this went on until around 11. Then, once my parents came home, a part for my car came in and so I installed that right away because I needed to, this took around an hour. After that, my parents told me to go get an oil change and so I did, this took until around 1:30. Next, I came home and my mom wanted me to eat. At this point it was 2 o'clock, so I told my GF, who was starting to get irritated because I still didn't go over, that I am going to eat quickly so that Her and I can hang out for about 2 hours or so. She did not like that. She blew up on me, she started to tell me that I care more about my car then her and that since I wanted to play games, we won't hang out at all. I was taken aback and I started to worry. I told her that I had to watch my sister and that I enjoyed playing my games for that time-being. She did not care. She started to say that I didn't love her and that I like the people who I play games more than her, even though I play with these people once a week. She cussed and wouldn't listen to the fact that I told her I had to stay home and that I needed an oil change. She even accused me of liking other girls more than her, even though we ALL hung out ONCE and she was the one who was distant the whole day, while I was trying to bring her into the conversations and trying to have her not be so distant AND even though the girls that were mentioned were her friends for about 2 years prior, and I had only met them recently and I have never cheated or have lied to her. 

&#x200B;

After about 2 hours of arguing over this I grew angry. I thought to myself that this was insane because I had hung out with her every day of last week for hours on end, and to get yelled at over something like that was crazy. I couldn't handle this and so I told her that I felt like I needed a break from feeling like I'm controlled. She said that she was very sorry and that she feels bad for telling me all the things that she did. The next day I agreed to see her and to talk about things. She started to cry and ask me what was going to happen, and I told her that I didn't know, but that I was sure I wanted a break from all the stress. This made her cry even more but then I asked to go home. Before I was going to leave she muttered, ""So you're gonna go play your games now aren't you"" in a sarcastic tone. I looked at her and she started to cry and apologize and I left. I texted her saying that I wanted a break but she kept telling me that she still wants to talk about it and come to a compromise. I then told her again to please respect my choice and that I wanted my space. She then told me that she dropped off my Christmas presents in front of my door while I didn't know and still proceeded to text me and tell me that she wants to talk. I kept asking her to respect my choice but she still persisted and so I blocked her number because I want a clear mind. I wanted to handle this in the most mature way but she kept crying and telling me that she will change and that I cannot shut her out of my life. I couldn't handle that anymore. Am I an asshole for doing this?"
1532,bu6twe,"WIBTA if I would warn future Internships because of a horrible working place and tell them to look for something else? Hello Reddit, 

Throwaway account, because i dont want to have this on my real account.



Right now i'm doing an ""internship"" in Ireland in cooperation with my school. My school was working with a company together that gets you a house and a working place so i dont have to bother about these things. I'm doing a class for media/graphic designer and the company sent me here for this job. In this place i got my living place and working place together, so put both together.



When I arrived here i was shocked about the situation here. Everything here is a total chaos. Everything is full of trash, the kitchen and bathroom got mold on the wall and the computers are minimum 10 years old and didnt even have the programs for a media designer and i had to install the whole Adobe suite. (He was lucky and i use it in my free time anyways). 



I'm not alone here, because there is another gut who is doing an ""internship"" here. He's from IT and has nothing to do here either. 



The man I am working for has money problems and problems with the bank (because they obviously want money, that he got from them). I am not a psychologist, but this guy looks like he has a totally hoarding disorder. He never wants to throw something away and if we try to clean something up or try to sort out the obvious trash he gets either sad or angry. If you look up the wikipedia page for ""Compulsive hoarding"", the picture is 1:1 the working place.



As we are doing his E-mails too, we have noticed that there are 2 girls that are planning to come here to work here. They will be way much underpaid and we really don't recommend anyone to do this here. 



So my question is: Would we be assholes if we're going to warn these girls and tell them to look for something else? (obviously anonymously)"
1533,bvdneh,"AITA I let my kid help herself to a cookie from my sisters house and she blew up at me My sister hates kids and has never really hidden that fact. Her political and moral beliefs don’t align with children being in the world I guess and as such she’s always been really cold and standoffish to my 6 y/o. 

We live 2 hours away from her, and she and her boyfriend were going on vacation for 2 weeks and asked me to check in on her place every other day because our parents are too old to go themselves. I’m a single dad, my wife passed away due to sudden onset of preeclampsia shortly before my kid was born, so where I go, my kiddo goes. She knows this. It’s been that way since my daughter was born. I loaded her up and took my kid for the 4 hour round trip. When we got there obviously I bought her inside to check on the house with me and my kid saw some aldi brand stroopwaffels in the kitchen on the counter and asked if she could have one. Of course, me thinking it was a perfectly reasonable request, said yes and took a cookie from the already opened package and that was that. I replaced the tie, so they’d remain fresh. And thought nothing more of it.

When my sister got back from vacation she snapped at me ‘did your daughter eat one of my stroopwaffles?’ I said yeah, sorry, it was a long journey and she’d got bored of her apple puffs and bananas in the car. I offered to replace them thinking they’d gone stale or something and she just said ‘I’d rather you hadn’t bought your kid inside my house, it’s not kid friendly and she CERTAINLY shouldn’t have been eating my food’. 

Tbh I’m incredibly hurt that I did her a favor and this is how she thinks to repay my kindness and my and my daughters time. I apologized and left it there but she’s been complaining to my mom and my mom told me I shouldn’t have been ‘helping myself’ to someone else’s food. I told mom that lesson learned, I’m doing my sister 0 favors from now on and now they’re both passively aggressively texting me calling me difficult. 

AITA?"
1534,afmf4k,"AITA for pulling boyfriend away who was short at a waitress? This actually happened back in like August but I keep thinking about it and was reminded of it last night when we returned to the same place. 

Back in August, my whole family went to a popular sports bar for my cousins 21st birthday and rented out the back of the restaurant because our family is quite large. Everything was fine and went well until it was time to leave. 

Now the floor in the majority of the restaurant has that shitty outdoor carpet that you find at places such as this that isn't soft in any way but also isn't smooth either. I hope you guys know what I'm talking about. 

Anyways, it was all carpeted besides this tile area by the hostesses podium. This area was slightly wet and kinda slippery from what I assume was a pop machine leaking. I slid a little and warned my family behind me but ultimately ignored it.  It seemed fresh and I was sure someone would clean it up. 

My boyfriend, however, had a different plan. He rudely pulled aside a waitress (not the hostess who was literally right there) who was very busy in the middle of carrying a lot of stuff and sneered at her that the floor was wet and they should ""probably clean it up or at least put a sign down."" He was very rude and I, feeling for then girl and being a waitress myself, pulled his arm away and told him to stop being rude. I was very embarrassed especially since he did this in front of my family and I thought they'd take my side but the opposite happened. My family kind of told me not to yell at him (I was not yelling in the slightest, I assume they meant scolding) but I kinda brushed it off and kept walking. This whole interaction was maybe 30 seconds long. 

I was the first to admit that I shouldn't have called him out like that and apologized for it but still told him that was rude and he should have been more polite and found a different employee and told them in a non-condescending way. 

The next weekend at a family BBQ my aunt came at me and told me that she was glad he said something and that I shouldn't have scolded him.  I told her that it wasn't the fact that he said it but the way, that I knew I should have went about it a different way, and apologized but still thought he was wrong. 

She kind of brushed me off and everyone treated me like I was some overdramatic bitch and even jokingly said stuff to each other about how they can't believe I want to be a teacher when I am so impatient and that I need to get checked for bipolar. I just ignored it. 

Maybe this is irrelevant, but I think my family pities him a lot  because his parents are shitty and are overly aware of my actions because I am and always have been very strong-willed, even as a child. I have always got the vibe that they think he's a poor defenseless guy and I'm a quick to get angry girlfriend. This is not true though. I have a slight temper but I rarely get short with my boyfriend and admit/apologize when I do. I just don't tolerate bullshit and will call it out when I see it. Up until that day, I had never done this to my boyfriend in front of them (or ever even in mean way in general) It's hard to describe. I didn't even think I was that mean to him during this incident, just that I should have talked to him about it afterward.

So what do you guys think? I know I should have said something in private, but am I the only asshole or were both of us wrong here? 

Also, sorry if the format is weird, I'm on mobile. "
1535,8dkmbc,"AITA for covering up cameras while housesitting? So I've just finished a month or so of housetitting for some people and they had some ""concerns"" as to why I would cover up the indoor camera. Now I'd like to point out that I had no way to turn them on or off or have any other kind of interaction with them, and that they could be viewed at any time. 

For me personally even though they said they were off and I do trust them,  it's just something that was in the back of my head, that someone could just be watching everything I was doing.

It's their reaction that really threw me off though, it was only covered when I was there just living my life, when I would go out anywhere it was always uncovered.

Edit: Should also mention these people have known me  for about 10 years and work with one of my family members, also cameras weren't installed until after I was shown around 2 weeks prior and told what to do in emergencies etc. "
1536,e4brnp,"AITA for leaving work early I work as a part timer in a fast food restaurant. I work on Fridays and weekends. I often work until closing time on Fridays as I have morning classes. On weekends, I would usually work until four. However, this week, I plan to shorten my working time as I want to focus more on my studies. There were deadlines and assignments coming in. My exams are coming next week. 

I messaged my manager and told her that I can work until one on Sunday. She agreed. 

There is a working sheet behind the kitchen. When I passed by, I was a bit shocked to see that I was put on a 9-4 shift. I remember I told her that I wanted to leave work early.

I spoke with her and she told me it was okay. On Sunday(today), it was unexpected as my manager messaged me in the morning, saying one of the part timers, who is working today, was not free. It was a last minute change and it made my manager stressed out a bit. 

There were only two people, including me in the kitchen to make the food and took orders. 

It was all over the place as there is a long queue. Two people is not enough to finish all orders. There were a few customers who felt impatient. We managed to pull through by multitasking.

My manager came to help us out in the business. She asked me if I can work until three which I refused politely. 

After that, things got tense. She would click her tongue whenever i do a few mistakes. Just a note, I have been working here since 27th September. It has been about a month. 

I have got the hang of things but I still have to cope during peak hours as that's when most customers would come. 

I heard her mumble under her breath a few times, ""you don't want to do cashier,"" and ""You are sabotaging my work.""

I was offended and hurt when I heard her doing that. I know work is very hard. I hate making people angry or stressed. I want to stay and help but I want to prepare for my exams and project presentations. I do not want to give up on my education.

I asked her, ""what is it?"" She kept quiet afterwards. 

I felt down afterwards. I leave the store with a heavy heart.

1538,ce0wpp,"AITA for leaving a bowl in the sink? This past weekend I was hanging out with my family at my aunt's house. Mainly my cousins and my sister. Nothing out of the ordinary until my cousin decided to make pasta. She was the only one who wanted it. But when she finally made it, she brought out bowls for everyone. I ended up eating a small bowl and put it in the sink. Nothing out the ordinary happens and we end up going home like any other time, and that was that. 

Fast forward to today I get a series of texts from my parents with pictures my aunt took of the sink with everyone's bowls in it. My parents are yelling through text that we raised you better than this and how could you. My aunt is apparently flipping her top about the bowls in the sink saying that leaving them there was disrespectful and we wont be allowed back into their house.

Never once in my adult life have I ever made a guest clean their own dishes. Especially not for food I didn't make or want.

1539,9xqfj1,"AITA for answering questions literally instead of telling the asker what they want to know? Okay, so I'm a fourth generation Korean American. I don't know a lick of any languages other than English and a bit of Spanish I learned in school. I've never been to Korea, nor do I want to go. My dad is the only person in my family who speaks any Korean or has been to Korea. And the only thing I know about Korean culture is what other people tell me. In short, I'm only Korean by blood and nothing else. I don't bring it up and I don't act any different from an average American, but I still always invariably get The Question from coworkers/strangers/Tinder peeps. Now, The Question comes in many different forms, but it's purpose is to elicit my ethnic background.

Here are some forms The Question takes and how I answer them. (These are actually what people say)

* ""Where are you from?"" Los Angeles
* ""No, I mean, where were you born?"" Los Angeles
* ""No, like, where are you REALLY from?"" ...Los Angeles
* ""Where are your parents from then?"" Well my mom was born in Los Angeles, but my dad is from Houston...
* ""What's your nationality?"" American
* ""What kind of Asian/Chinese are you?"" Asian American. No Chinese. (note: There are many people who are convinced that 'Asian' and 'Chinese' are interchangeable)
* (my personal favorite) ""What are you?"" Yeah, let me sum up my entire existence and identity with my race...

Having had this conversation at least once a week since I was a kid, I know exactly what the asker mean by the first question. I know I'm being cheeky, but this question always rubs me the wrong way. It's also kinda funny/sad to see people try to find different ways to ask this question so I let it run as long as they keep trying. And I only tell them the literal answer of the question they ask. Yesterday (after about three failed attempts at The Question) a coworker said that I was being rude since I knew what she was asking. My rationale for my behavior was that if they do want to know this information about me, they should be able to ask the right questions. It's not that hard. 'What's your ethnicity/ethnic background' is perfectly fine. I feel like all those other forms of The Question innately make the person being asked The Question seem more 'different' or 'foreign'. So, AITA for answering someone's questions literally instead of telling them what they want to know?

&#x200B;



When I still lived in LA, there were a lot of people like me, Asian Americans whose parents and grandparents were born in the US. I didn't get The Question quite as much then. But after moving to the East coast for college and work, I get The Question all the time. I'm guessing it's because there's not as many Asian families that have been here for generations like in the West (best) coast. Let's go back to The Question. If a non-Asian in Virginia who grew up in LA was asked ""Where are you from?"" how would they respond? Would they say, ""Oh my family has roots in Scotland and Ireland""? No, they would say they're from LA. So, why should I answer any differently? Why do **I** have to accommodate to other's expectations of me that are obviously double standards and assumptive? "

I always figured I'd be the *last* person to ask a breastfeeding mother to go elsewhere, but I was immediately disgusted -- no one should be breastfeeding *in* a public pool! Not because it's indecent or sexual, but for the same reasons you don't blow your nose in the pool, pee in the pool, have sex in the pool, or just generally risk adding extra fluids to the pool!

1541,ewb4l9,"AITA for giving career advice to my cousin and basically saying that ""it's all about who you know"" I am 26 and I've gone from being a very mediocre student in high school, to an electrical and computer engineer working at my dream job in robotics.

I won't lie, it took a lot of work.

But honestly I don't feel like academic work alone gets you there. Or even halfway there. I really credit the people in my life who studied with me, the people who were mentors to me.. The friends who helped me study for interviews, the people who referred me for job interviews and believed in me. I know that I wouldn't be where I am now without them.

I saw the difference firsthand; in college I mostly kept to myself and I had trouble landing summer internships or a job. 

But after college, I became a lot more outgoing. And then I learned about a lot more opportunities. I heard about places that were hiring that I hadn't heard of before. I heard about what specific companies really wanted out of a job opening, insider info that's not clear from an online listing.

And when I started job searching again, I had a network of people who were happy to refer me for interviews, be good references, look over my resume and help me study for interviews. I've done the same for a lot of my friends since then. 

----

So anyway, my family had a bunch of family over for Christmas this year, and my cousin's dad asked me if I had any advice for succeeding in engineering, for his son whos going to college next year.

I gave the advice that, you should work hard in school but you should also work hard at building a good network of people in your career field. Because engineers who can do engineering are a dime a dozen.

But having people who can refer you for jobs, who trust in your skills and friendliness enough to want to recommend you for a job at their company, having people who can teach you how to navigate different professional environments, or support you when you learn together... That kind of stuff will set you apart.

I didn't credit my success to being the best engineer, I know for a fact that I'm not. Or for being the hardest working. Or smartest. I gave the most credit to the support and advice and friendship I had from my peers and mentors.

My cousin's dad chewed me out privately after that, saying I was undervaluing the value of hard work to his son. 

I said I respectfully disagree, I was saying hard work doesn't get you 100% of the way. I know too many people who work hard as fuck but never made good money or felt satisfied in their careers, and I think part of that was not having a network that opened up better opportunities for them.

He was mad saying I was teaching bad values, that is about who you ""get in with"" rather than your intelligence or skills. And I said that I didn't think those were bad values, that was just the honest truth. Engineering isn't special, just like anything else in life, you'll need people skills.

1543,chuk0x,"AITA for refusing to take a photo of some tourists for them? We live at the beach so every summer we're jam-packed with tourists. Day before yesterday I was off from work so I decided to drive uptown and go have lunch on one of the waterfront restaurants out on the deck, have some local seafood and read my book. It was mostly tourists eating at that time because it was a weekday and midday, everyone was at work. There was this family that was acting like they'd never been in public before, let alone at the beach. I get it, not everyone lives at the beach, some people have actually never seen the beach before. And our beach is really beautiful; clean white sand, Banker ponies, nature reserves, the lighthouse in the distance. I'm very fortunate to have been born and raised here. But ask any local, we're sick to death of rude-ass tourists.

&#x200B;

So I'm at the restaurant and this table is just letting loose, acting a fool, letting their kids run around all wild. At one point they were throwing bread rolls and one of them hit me in the side of the head. The kids were throwing things into the water where living creatures like the seafood they were eating, our biggest income being fisheries and wildlife.

&#x200B;

Anyway, the outdoor seating of the restaurant is on a deck that is over the water and it has amazing views. They were taking photos of the view and started posing for them. To be frank they were getting all up in my bubble, and at one point I had a stranger practically leaning over my meal. They started yelling at each other about getting a group shot. By this point I had taken my food and moved my stuff to a table further down. They get lined up against the dock with the view in the background. At first they tried a selfie-stick but it didn't reach far enough to get them all in. Then they tried putting the camera on their table but it was too low, only got their lower bodies.

&#x200B;

""Oh, hey, her! Her at the table! Hey, lady, would you come over here and hold the camera, take a photo of us?"" I realized they were talking to me so I looked up and shook my head, pointed ta my food. They stared pleading, telling me all about how they're on vacation, first time at the beach for the little kids, they just wanted a nice group shot, could I come and help them. I told them no, that if I left my table the 'gulls would land and eat my food (not a lie, our birds are cocky little assholes but they're locals too). I motioned for my waitress because I just wanted to leave, I was sick of their misbehavior. They start hollering at me to just ""take the damn photo"". I didn't think they deserved my help after their behavior. I paid and left. The younger (drunk) adults were cussing me and trashing me. When I told my fiancé he said that I should have just taken the photo for them since I should be used to tourists and just ignored their behavior. He said I was no better when we went to New Orleans and got wasted, but that was Mardi Gras.

Was I an asshole?

&#x200B;

ETA: I'm beginning to agree with the minority that ESH. I could have taken the photo but I judged the family based on their behavior. It wouldn't have done me any harm to take the photo. I could have gotten the waitress to take the photo or have her kick them out. But, based on their behavior, I refuse to accept that I'm the only asshole here. My past behavior has no factor in this. Mardi Gras is a totally different hat than our little town. We're primarily fisheries and wildlife, military, school system, and medical. The primary age of locals is 55 and above."

A pee stain from my dog, repairs that needed to be done to my house.  I took care of these all the time, as I felt since it was brought to my attention I should.  ER was never happy.  Would still find things to complain about. 

The shit posting on social media started subtle, I should have stopped it then and there.  My female German Shepherd at the time would tinkle out of excitement when someone got home.  Shes over it but it was a problem.  ER gave constant complaints about how untrained my dog was.  ER would constantly post the accidents to social media complaining.  It started to get under my skin.  ER then would announce every time company of hers or mine would come over, ""Hey watch out she's gonna pee everywhere and all over you""   (I was catching hints of snarky)

I confronted her about it, and made it clear I was not happy.  I told her to stop sharing with everyone this issue.  I eventually broke my dog of this habit through training.   Never a thank you, mind you. 

Moving on.  ER was adamant the carpets get cleaned now that I had broken this habit.   No effort on her end, but my gosh, THESE CARPETS.   Back to shit posting all over ER's social media about ""crusty carpets"".   

My girlfriend who has the biggest heart heard her ""pleas"".  She does not make good money and spent a good amount of money and physical labor cleaning my carpets.  My GF insisted on it because she's too nice for others, god bless her.  Not even a fucking THANK YOU from ER.   Still complained that the couch wasn't clean enough!!

FFWD.  ER brings a cat into my home WITHOUT asking.  Her friend is out of the country for two months and ER was her ""last resort"".   Great.. a cat that shits in my tub for two months.  I made it very clear how upset I was over this.  But ER claimed I was her friends friend too, how could I do this and be upset?!.  oof...

ER recently brought her BF's German Shepherd over to watch for an undetermined amount of time (again without asking)  I love him to death but she does not feed or water him and I do it out of pity.  She doesn't scoop his poop either, and the guy is a god damn linebacker... huge deuces.. so you guessed it.  I'm scooping his poop to.  But hey ER's a dog person, according to her anyways.

If you haven't gotten the picture by now, I can comment for more content of the petty behavior, and stories like this.   ON TO THE SAUCE!

I was fed up with a lot of stuff so I sent four rules to my renters.   Made clear to the other two before hand that this was 99% not related to them and not to take it personally.

I requested (ER was constantly guilty of all this)
1. Please no more smoking pot, I'm tired of coming home to my house reeking of pot.
2.  Stop putting the baby gate up and limiting my dog to the landing on the stairs (mind you a 4x4 area)  ER did this constantly and it really made my blood boil.  My baby girl doesn't chew a thing or have accidents, and ER's way of taking care of her is to stuff the poor girl into a corner.
3.  When you leave the house, please lock the doors.  Stop leaving out the side door (you can't lock it from the outside)  My brother is a Detroit cop and I have a psycho ex.  ER would leave all day and come home and leave the doors unlocked.  I was not ok with this.  4.  Stop changing my thermostat, it's my house, my temperature.  ER would raise it by 4-8 degrees because she was cold.   The rest of us, men, were too hot.  

Moving on.  ER does NOT take this well and send paragraphs back about how I can't control everything and how I keep stating it's my house but OUR living space.  

Que this morning.   I came home, had to adjust the thermostat.  ER wouldn't even look at me.  Went back downstairs to let the dogs out, had to adjust it again.  Now here's where I have an amazing friend who I love dearly that is friends with her too, we'll call him AF.

AF texts me, hey ER keeps sending snaps to me, and I assume others - of how this house is terrible, has pee stains and smells like poop for the past year.  There's a wall I need to fix where I did a plumbing repair, ER posted that too of how this hole in the wall is deplorable.  AF tells me all about this, but also says he told ER he told me.  So she knows.  

This all brings me to this.  I ordered a Nest so I can lock my thermostat.  Passive aggressive as fuck, but hey my house.  

So Am I the Asshole for making rules? Would I Be The Asshole if I serve ER an eviction notice?  I evicted my ex before, so I know how to do this.   (To add fuel to the reddit pitchforks I've given ER rent extensions 3 times!)   To add the last bit of context -  ER stated long ago she would be moved out by Sept. 1st.  9-1-18.. but has been.. having a hard time finding somewhere to live.  ER is looking for houses with the friend that is currently out of the country for two months.. I don't know how that's possible but ok! 

So, AITA?  WIBTA?

*edit*  The ""year old stains""  ER brought up are new from my Male German Shepherd Pup.  I'm working on potty training.  Beyond me how she has a problem with that but allows a cat to shit in my house in a box...

1546,a1w5nv,"AITA for telling one of my suite mates that I don't want to eat with her? So I (20 M) live with three other people (20 F, 20 F, and 18 F) in a suite. The four of us generally get along pretty well and I get along super well with my roommate. She and I are in year 3 of living together. We're all STEM majors except for the youngest one and she is also the only one of us who's vegan. I don't necessarily mind the fact she's a vegan at all, except that eating with her becomes really really tiresome because it quickly becomes a lecture about morality, how she's doing less damage, you're a terrible person for eating meat, etc etc. Basically, you can't just enjoy a meal together because she has to say something.

She's also tried to lecture me over my insect collection for entomology. I'm currently enrolled in entomology and hope to go to grad school for it. The collection required me to kill and pin insects, and she kept telling me how cruel it is, their blood is on my hands (never mind the fact insects have hemolymph, not blood, which I wanted to tell her but did not because I figured it wouldn't help), etc etc. as if I enjoyed the action of having to kill 40+ insects to display their dead bodies. I had to do it for a grade. How else do you think they get insects you see pinned and displayed like in museums and insectariums?

Whenever she used to ask to eat with me, I'd make up some lie about how I was waiting for someone already or I had to leave soon anyway. But I've had a rough month and this time I straight-up told her no because I wasn't in the mood for a lecture about my meal. I also told her I'm fine with her being vegan, but her guilt-tripping and lectures on morality are seriously getting old fast and makes being around her something I don't enjoy. AITA for telling her I don't want to eat with her and why?

1547,9q1t1s,"AITA? Dude follows me for hours on end and I refuse to work nights from now on I work at a small family owned business that does kids birthday parties and fun types of entertainment. We also offer specific type of indoor sport that the store does team nights occasionally.

For context I am an 18 year old female who often works nights until 9/10pm. 

My issue is that there is this guy (who is about 28 years old) comes in every single Friday, Saturday and Sunday night who does nothing but follow me around. Sometimes for up to six hours at a time. 

He supposedly just here to see if any other people are turning up to play specific sport but he is constantly two feet behind me at all times. I will constantly bump into him if I turn around too quickly.

Even as I type this he is sitting across from me staring at me as I'm typing this on my phone. 

All my coworkers say he's just lonely and that it's not weird at all, but I am seriously uncomfortable with him being here constantly. He does not announce his presence and will just stand next to the counter in the corner until you notice and then say hello. 

I've spoken to my manager who just laughs it off and says thats just how this guy is and that he's always been a little odd because he's lonely and lives by himself. 

I've now refused to work night shifts because my store refuses to do anything about this man or how it makes me uncomfortable.

My boss told me I'm making everyone's lives miserable because we have very limited staff and I'm the only one who is usually able to work these hours but I'm refusing to. 

AITA?

1548,bovjbb,"AITA for not letting my friend stay over in my dorm To add context I'm at university in England and when this event occurred I had just finished 2 exams back to back. I was running on limited sleep and was exhausted.

My friend who has been done with exams for the past week decided he wanted to drink till he couldn't stand and had lost his room keys. He was throwing up everywhere and was just being very annoying. He kept saying he was going to stay in my room even though all I wanted to do was sleep as I had just finished exams. I went to my room and crashed hard and at 3am I hear a loud banging on the door and hear him saying let me in to which I pretend to be asleep. He eventually goes away and then I get a text saying ""thanks for not opening the door,"" to which I'm infuriated by.

He has other friends in the dorm who are also done with exams and also I just didn't want to put up with the throwing up being so sleep deprived. If he was sober I would have happily let him in. AITA?"
1549,b5zk48,"AITA - friend was mad we didn’t make him a third wheel on a double date An old friend, let’s call him Dave, always stays at our house when he’s in town, and leaves it until the very last minute to ask if he can stay.  It’s always when a friend group birthday/event is coming up that he will wait until the day before to ask if he can stay... even though he’s had a month and half since he received the party invitation (this happens repetitively).  

Recently we were asked by a neighbouring couple to come over for drinks before we all went to mutual friend’s birthday.  We don’t know this couple at all, and they had asked my husband and I over a few times so we wanted to finally make that happen. We agreed to the plans almost 3 weeks in advance.  Dave, like clockwork, reaches out the day before the birthday to ask if he can stay with us.  I tell him that he is more than welcome to stay with us but that we have plans for a double date prior to the party and then gave him some alternative ideas of what he could do while we were with the other couple to keep himself occupied... like hanging out with another old friend in the city, going shopping at the mall etc.  When it comes to the time of the double date, Dave, just wants to hang out in our home alone and makes no effort to do any of the things he had said he was going to do.  After the party is finished he had apparently spent the night complaining to others that we had ditched him, and we should have invited him to the double date we had gone on, had it been him he would have never done such a thing etc...

Considering it was a double date, and we didn’t know the couple I would have thought it was rude to bring a random third wheel with us.... AITA here? "
1550,c0g14w,"WIBTA If I made a huge deal over my lawyer billing for an unprompted e-mail? Backstory. I own a company with someone else. We have used this lawyer before to make a contract for us and it went great but was a little spendy. 

Later on an ex employee decided to sue us for bogus reasons. I took the  notice straight to this lawyer. We worked it out and provided documentation required and from that point in never heard back from the other lawyer. We recieved the bill for all the work done and paid it in full. 

Flash forward to 4 months later where we have assumed it was all good and moved on. I get an unsolicited email, as in I have never reached out since then. ""Dear client, I just wanted to email you to say that since we still have not heard back I will consider this matter closed. They must have dropped it. They can reopen it if they want for this long of time. Thank you.""

I simply replied ""ok thank you."" 

Today, a week later, I got a letter in the mail due for $38 for them emailing me their message...

Would I be the asshole if I made a big deal about paying this? Its not about the dollar amount. I just dont feel like theh have any right to charge me for that. I knew it was closed by not hearing back and had paid in full and I feel its unethical to send me that bill."
1551,a9mcn3,"AITA for ratting my sister out to my mom? One of my little sisters (14F) has sort of gone off the rails— sneaking out to smoke weed and have sex with much older guys, juuling constantly to the point of addiction, being a total bitch to my parents, etc. I’m currently in college so I can’t be at home to talk to her or deal with her behavior directly, and my other sister (16F) is being very enabling of her behavior and refuses to do anything about it out of fear of betraying her trust. 

I know I should let my sisters make their own mistakes, and this would be a lot different if she was 16 or 17 (I’d probably just give her a little advisory talk and leave it alone), but I feel like 14 is way too young to be getting into this stuff and her grades, friendships, family relationships etc (the important things in my view) are suffering because of it. She gets very defensive and angry if I try to talk to her about her behavior (says I’m acting condescending or like I’m better than her), so long story short I’ve ended up just telling my mom everything she’s been up to. 

My parents are fairly overprotective, so this resulted in her phone being taken away permanently, her being grounded indefinitely, my parents regularly drug testing her, and a huge loss of trust between her and my parents, not to mention her and me, as well as my other sister disapproving. It seems like nobody can get through to her, and I am afraid for her health and safety if it continues, so I felt like my only option was to be the narc. Did I overreact? AITA? "
1552,6d78ki,"AITA for telling my BF that he stinks? I love my bf. But he sometimes has a pretty unpleasant odor.

He has stopped wearing any kind of cologne because he wants to only put natural products on and in his body. I understand this. Unfortunately, this also means that he doesn't wear deodorant.

I don't know if he can smell himself but I can and sometimes his odor is pretty potent. He had a big launch event for a company that he works for two months ago and when I arrived to this big event where he was networking, he reeked. REEKED. He is very sensitive and gets very upset when I bring up issues. I can't tell if he is simply hard on himself or if he is being purposefully or inadvertently manipulative so that I stop bringing things up. For instance, me making a simple request turns into him having a meltdown about being the him being the most terrible person ever. 

So I attempted to approach the stinky issue very delicately. He was training for a bike trip and decided to start biking to work. I suggested that he maybe start wearing deodorant so as not to offend people with his odor when he arrives to work after the workout and throughout the day. He was VERY upset by my suggestion. I clarified that I am not suggesting this out of malice but mostly out of a pursuit for professionalism and out of concern for him. He eventually took my comment as it was intended. Since that time we purchased some natural deodorant. I've experimented with it myself and it works pretty well but I'd noticed that boyfriend hadn't used it. The other day after we'd both showered I offered him some and he put it on. I even remarked at how good it smelled on him and how much I liked it.

Well, a few days later, I guess he skipped a shower for a day. His boss is a little...hipstery and takes pride in only showering once every two weeks. Somehow, that works for his boss as he doesn't seem to smell. On a day where my boyfriend was kind of stinky his boss made the comment that it was getting hotter and that maybe they'd both need to start taking more frequent showers. My boyfriend laughed about this but I was really mortified for him.

Tonight after his shower I again offered him some deodorant. He had already been kind of crabby and we'd been bickering a bit. He made the sarcastic comment that he's sorry that he's not hygienic enough for me. And I got pretty frustrated. I told him that I shouldn't have to walk on eggshells to communicate with him. And that it shouldn't take HIS BOSS telling him that he stinks to do something about it when I tried to help him out with that a few months ago.

He said that I was cruel for using something that he shared with me against him.

Ugh. Can't win.

Am I the asshole in this situation?"
1553,aibiat,"AITA for having a half-day off on Dr. MLK Jr. Day? I work full-time in a blue collar profession. I also am a full-time biology student.

At the start of this school semester when asked what my schedule will be for school and what I needed off I texted my boss back this:

""All I need off is the mornings of Mon and Tues . . . will need to come in at 12 those days.""

Her reply was this:

""Ok.  so you will work everyday just come in at 12 on Mon and Tues . . . got it""

This has worked since the start of the semester.

Fast forward to today Monday, Jan 21, also known as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day. I am awake around 6:50 AM, making breakfast, getting ready to do some yardwork, etc. I receive a text from my boss asking this:

7:09 AM Boss - ""Hey are coming in today. I figured since school is out today you would be here at 7""

7:46 AM Me - ""My plan was to still come in at noon.""

7:54 AM Boss - ""Why""

7:58 AM Me - ""Just because I had already taken off the first half of Mondays and Tuesdays this semester.""

9:18 AM Boss - ""In the future when school is going to be closed please run it by us if you are wanting to keep the same schedule. We were expecting you to come in at 7 since there was no school today.""

As of now I haven't responded partly because the situation dumbfounded me, and partly because I will be at work at noon today, and fully expect an in person conversation that parallels these texts pretty close. 

Yes school is out today.

No I did not specifically request Dr. MLK Jr. Day off.

Yes, I have texts that show our agreement for me to work half-days on Mondays and Tuesdays this semester. 

So, AITA for thinking I had this morning off?

Edit: After posting this and digesting the circumstances, I did go ahead and acknowledge that I understood my boss's text. I went and clocked in at noon, and there wasn't a discussion made anything.

Another redditor brought up the fact that I didn't go in ASAP when I was made aware of my boss's expectation. So for full disclosure, my daughter's daycare is closed as well today. So I had her in the morning before dropping her off at my MIL's. I chose to omit this info because I felt that her being with me had no bearing on whether or not I was the asshole for assuming I had the half-day off.

Good points made by all."
1554,eh7csf,"AITA for posting messages exposing my friend as a liar over something that happened at her wedding? I’m using a throwaway account because I use my main solely in another sub.

I was invited to an old school friend’s wedding that happened a few days ago. We’re not ride or die, but whenever we’re both in the same region we always meet up.

I ordered a nice yellow jumpsuit for the wedding from a trusted retailer. When it came, it was much paler than the picture, basically a straw yellow. I started to worry as I’d read those stories about guests wanting to steal the thunder by wearing white/traditional wedding dress colours at weddings, and I messaged my friend to ask if she was wearing white. She said she was, and asked why. I sent a picture of the jumpsuit and said that this was what I’d been sent in place of a much brighter colour. She said that it looked fine, and she’d shut anyone up if they tried to make a deal about it on the day.

On the day itself, I didn’t actually get any comments about it directly, which was a relief. However, when I went to the bathroom, I encountered two of the bridesmaids gossiping about how that girl in the jumpsuit (so, me) had the nerve to wear it, especially after the bride had told her directly it wasn’t suitable. To frame this as it happened, I was in a cubicle when they came in and started chatting. I came out of the cubicle, and said that no such conversation had happened, and if the bride really had an issue she should have told me months ago when we talked about it. They basically scoffed and said they’d believe me when they saw the ‘receipts’. I saw them later on in the evening with the bride, and all three of them were giving me the stink eye.

Yesterday, the bride posted a thank you message on Facebook, with the comment that ‘even scene-stealing wannabes’ couldn’t spoil the day. I was going to leave it, but one of the bridesmaids commented with a poorly-taken picture of me from behind with drawn-on devil horns and tail. I reacted on impulse, and posted screenshots of the conversation where the bride had told me that my outfit was fine, with a comment saying that it was a shame that the bride couldn’t tell me to my face there was an issue, and that since I’d been asked for ‘receipts’, here they were. The comment got a few further comments saying that the tea had been spilled and that this is what happens when people don’t know all the facts, as well as the inevitable ones saying that I was being childish and creating a drama.

I do view this as stooping down to the level of those who couldn’t even tell me straight there was an issue (I mean I had another dress in my car just in case I got comments) in how I reacted, but I also think I was defending my reputation and honour among people I’ve known for over two decades. The peace-keeping side of me wants to apologise to the bride, but my heart knows she won’t offer the same olive branch, especially now people know she was two-faced in this situation."
1555,apzok4,"AITA for not wanting to buy a house with my brother? 19F here. First time posting on a subreddit.. forgive me for formatting errors. Also this post is super long because I'm not even the slightest bit concise. TLDR at bottom. 

Last night my father was talking to me (mom in the room) about my plans beyond college. He started suggesting that my brother (24) and I buy a house together once I'm done with college. With my great cr

I currently have great credit, and if I keep it up for a few years, I will be able to buy a house or a condo on my own. I'm building my savings, too. I have my own plans beyond college to buy a house that I can live in and rent rooms to people to and eventually sell it if that's the right plan for me. 

I told my dad that I don't want to buy a house with my brother. He hasn't proven himself to me yet. My dad gets upset for a second about how I need to be there to take care of my brother and make sure he stays on track once they're gone. I tell him that I'm not planning on leaving my brother behind. But as of right now, I can't see myself buying a house with my brother.

This morning my mom is all mad at me. She's telling me that her and my dad are handing me my education on a silver platter, and that my plans to move out after college are selfish, when I could be helping both myself and my brother by going in on a house with him. I left her room because she told me not to talk to her about it anymore. Then she texts me a few hours later asking why I'm hiding in my room. I tell her I'm annoyed and don't think I'm being selfish right now. She texts me the following: ""Of course you don't think you are selfish. Who does especially when they are being selfish."" Maybe I am being selfish. In fact I think I am being selfish. But I don't think it's so bad to look out for my own self interest in this situation..

Also, my parents have to pay out of pocket for my schooling because they haven't filed a tax return in years so I can't apply for FAFSA to get financial aid. This has made it harder on them because they're dishing out about $2000 a semester for me to go to school. They have constantly pushed me to go to school and get a degree because none of them ever got one. And I WANT my degree. They have seemed happy to be paying for my schooling because the payoff when I'm older will be great. AITA for thinking them ""handing me my education on a silver platter"" isn't such a bad thing? They didn't file tax returns. It's not my fault I can't get FAFSA. 

It makes me so frustrated. My parents haven't even talked to my brother about whether or not he wants to own a house with me. I would assume he doesn't. I don't really understand how my education factors into any of this because my brother does not pay for my education.

TL;DR My parents want me to buy a house with my brother once I'm done with college. He hasn't shown me that he can keep his finances in order for a long enough time to actually buy a house with him. Mom thinks I am being selfish because they pay out of pocket for my schooling. I don't think I owe it to him or them to buy a house with my brother to supposedly help him. AITA?"
1556,crv1tm,"AITA if I did not give up my seat to an elderly woman on an half empty bus even if she was polite at first? We (me and a friend) went in town for buying a few things, we took the bus together. We didn't sit directly across one another as it was quite hot in there but each on one side of the aisle so we could discuss. A few stops later, the Old One (in her 60s) comes in and walk in our direction(we were around the middle of the bus close to the exit). She passed a few empty seats, even those for the elderly/handicapped and stopped almost between us and looked at the window seat behind me.  
I asked if she wanted to sit and moved my leg a bit more so she can pass. She looked at me and said with some feeble and kind off apologetic voice that she wanted both seats as she would like some space.  
My brain went ""uh what"".  
Note again that she could've sat on the empty elder seats or behind my friend who had 2 free seats. So I pointed at the 2 free seats behind him and said that those were free.  
She looked at the seats, then at me and my seat and said again that she wanted my place, this time without the tremolo in her voice. It started to piss me off a bit now. Stayed calm and pointed again at the free seats. She went fucking instant ballistic and pointed at me and said something like ""Young man those are my seats I sit here all the time when I go to xxx in town and I want to sit here"".  
Well I said no and offered the window seat again, I wanted to add ""annoying bitch"" but didn't. She looked at me, huffed and went behind my friend. She started complaining about how young people had no respect for the elderly nowadays with a guy close to us in the bus. He seemed to agree. Well fuck you I respect old people but it does not mean I should agree to any of their tantrums. My friend said later that I was a dick and I should have moved to prevent that dispute to happen.

1558,e4ugkz,"AITA for deciding to take the bus and making a friend travel 4 hours by car in the snow alone? I traveled to my hometown on Friday by bus (4 hour trip), a friend told me she (I’ll call her Brenda) was going alone by car on Saturday morning and leave Sunday at noon, she asked me to go back with her so she wouldn’t make the trip back alone because there was probability of snow, I was planning to go back by bus but agreed.

On Sunday the pick up time came and she wasn’t there, as a background Brenda is always late, to date the most I have waited for her is one hour.

I sent her a text 40 minutes later and she texts back that some friends invited her to eat, I answered that she could have told me because my family also invited me to go out for lunch but I decline to wait for her, Brenda then said that it was unplanned and they were gonna eat quickly and she was gonna come pick me up.

1.5 hours after pick up time she texts me: “They keep ordering food!”, I ask her for an approximate time to leave and she tells me that “just a few more minutes”. 2.5 hours of waiting and she hasn’t texted me again, by this time I’m angry and fed up, so I sent her a message: “Thank you for the ride offer but I’m gonna be taking the bus back”, she answers quickly and asks me if I’m being serious and if I can’t wait 30 more minutes. So I tell her that I’m angry and that I think its really disrespectful of others to be late, and that I don’t wanna be hypocritical and act nice for the 4 hour trip and that is better to travel separately and met later in the city. She answered me: “Ok, if that’s what you want, I understand”.

Later I’m on the bus back and a mutual friend sends a text on a group chat asking where the road trip selfies are, Brenda answers that she is going back alone because I stood her up, I don’t feel like I stood her up and I don’t know what to answer...

Immediately one of our friends sends me a private text asking why I didn’t go back with Brenda, I tell her about the wait time and the answer she gave me was that I already knew Brenda is always late (true), I could have waited (also true), and that Brenda is gonna be traveling all by herself and there’s a storm coming.

It made me feel bad, guilty and worried for Brenda, because it gets dark really early and it has been snowing, but at the same time I think me being angry was something legitimate, I was respectful of the time she set and organized my day to be ready on time and she couldn’t do the same, she didn’t even let me know until I asked. A few of our mutual friends are making me feel like the bad guy. AITA?

TLDR: A friend made me wait almost 3 hours for her, I told her “thanks I’ll rather go by bus” because I was angry and didn’t want to make nice with her for the 4 hour trip, she told our mutual friends I stood her up and they are telling me I’m the bad guy."

I put my headphones on and cranked it up the best I could but about 40 minutes later this girl was still yelling. I walked over to the girl's room (it was open) and she saw me and came out. I asked the girl if she and her friend could sing/yell quieter because I could hear them through my headphones. At this point I saw her ""friend"" who started yelling at me. Based on her behavior I could see she had some sort of condition and in retrospect I could have guessed autistic but I was already there so I just finished my request that they please speak a bit quieter and I went back to my room.

About ten minutes later I was called over by my RA who went off on me for being rude to this girl's autistic sister. She said I was being rude and not understanding their situation and that she is allowed to have her family over. I expressed that I didn't mind her sister being over but 40 minutes of singing was excessive and I didn't think it was rude for me to ask them to quiet down a bit. My RA said that autistic people can't help it and I need to be more understanding. I said that technically the floor was ""quiet hours"" anyways and that I just wanted to be able to study. This made my RA *really* mad. I asked what I should do instead then. She said I should have ignored it (because the sister is autistic) and left to go to the library. I said ""ok"".

I genuinely can't tell if I was the asshole. At the time I didn't think anything was wrong with politely asking if they could be a bit quieter. But maybe I'm just being inconsiderate of those with autism? All I know is my RA is/was really mad at me for what I did."
1560,d9v68m,"AITA for wanting my friend's ex? I found out that my friend was depressed about not forgetting his ex girlfriend (who ended up 3/4 months), but today he is gradually getting carried away by a new girlfriend. I went after his ex-girlfriend to find out the reason for the breakup, but I found out he was a horrible person and that she was treated like trash! After getting to know her better, I involuntarily fell in love with her and she with me.

It didn't take long for him to find out and ask me to run away from her, but she's the woman I dreamed of as a child. (intelligent, loves art, classical music, watches anime and has a dark past like mine ...)

She and I are moving on, but it hurts my heart to look at my friend every day (we work and study electronics together, and it will last another two years).

Am I stupid to ignore my recent friend (who is slowly getting over everything) to stand by the woman of my dreams?

1561,dlfakj,"AITA for borrowing friends car; got boot which forces him to pay unpaid back tickets? In short, I borrowed my friends car. He asked of me that when I return the car, I park it somewhere off-campus where they do not scan plates as he had $800 worth of unpaid tickets on it. I agreed. 
I returned and parked the car somewhere I thought was safe - I texted and told him exactly where I parked it. He is also aware that I am not as intimately knowledgeable of that neighborhood (he is...) 
Following day his car got a boot and he was forced to pay $800 of unpaid tickets HE acquired in the past. 
He is adamant that I now owe him half of what he paid, so $400 of tickets I had nothing to do with, simply because my mistake got him caught.  
I refused of course (I was willing to pay the $50 boot fee but certainly not his unpaid tickets)

1562,bm8s7c,"AITA for getting annoyed at someone's ""magic trick"" So my ""friend"", loose term since he's sort of just a part of my friend group and I consider him to be somewhat of an attention-seeker, is a bit of a magician in that he knows some sleight-of-hand, card tricks, etc. Anyway, last night we went to the bar to celebrate the end of the semester and let loose a little. Mind you, the bar is really packed and crowded and when we were about an hour into our drinking session I notice that my wallet is missing. I look around and start to panic because I assume that I was either pickpocketed or I had dropped it somewhere when this guy waves his hands and says, ""Is this your wallet?"" with a pretty theatrical emphasis. We all kinda chuckle, but internally I was a bit annoyed that he had the nerve to just take my wallet like that and I responded with, ""Yeah man haha, thanks for finding it! May I have it back please?"" He then puts his finger up in a 'Hold-on a second' kinda way and says, ""For your inattention I shall make 20 bucks disappear!"" I chuckled, thinking he was joking, but then this guy proceeded to take 20 bucks out of my wallet! I grabbed it away before he could and was a bit stunned he had the nerve to take my money like that. He then used the 'Dude it's just a joke' excuse and was pissed that I grabbed my wallet away from him. After that I could feel a bit of tension in the air, but I thought it blew over cuz we proceeded to have a pretty fun night, but I could tell he was really annoyed at me the rest of the night. The next day I talked to him and requested that he not do anything like that anymore cuz I work hard for my money and I didn't give him permission to snatch it like that. However, he thought the talk I asked him to have was going to be an apology and that next time I should just let him have his fun and that I'm overreacting.  I personally don't think I overreacted when I took my wallet back, but two of my friends said I should've just let him finish and that I was the asshole and should've apologized to him. I have no intention of doing so, and am currently thinking of who and who isn't coming to my house for the annual summer BBQ and currently have a few friends crossed off the list. I don't like cutting people out of my life, but I consider this to be toxic entitled behavior and do not want to put up with it. I know just from this it seems like one moment, but this behavior pattern extends past this and although I may be overreacting with the BBQ I think it's the best decision for me right now."
1563,eeoe76,"WIBTA If I report someone to their company? So for context - I work at a facility with a cafeteria that is run by a different company that is contracted. Several months to a year ago I submitted a complaint to the contracted company regarding cross contamination and the manager of the cafeteria spending all his time in the back office and not helping his staff. The manager has since quit or was fired, not sure which.

At the time I wrote the complaint regarding cross contamination of ingredients a new line cook had recently started. I am lucky in that I do not have food allergies but there are many who do who avoid the cafe because of the contamination issue instead of sending feedback/complaints because they didn't want to ""rock the boat"". I submitted a complaint because a newer employee at the time ended up having a reaction and started avoiding the cafeteria instead of submitting a complaint. 

The cross contamination is still an issue btw. 

Today my co-worker came up to me and informed me she was asked to pass on a message from the line chef. The line chef, I'll call them R, stated that they wanted me to send an apology/letter to the company stating how well they are doing and that I don't have any issues with how they work. Their reasoning for this is because I submitted the complaint when they had just started and didn't know them and the staff got a lot of grief from their parent company because of the cross contamination. R also stated to my co-worker that they wanted this to be sent if I intended on continuing to get food in the cafeteria because ""obviously"" I have no issue with the food. They also added that because I submitted the feedback they have refused to be nice to me because I made them look bad. (I do not know how they know I submitted the complaint/feedback - my co-worker thinks that they just showed her the email I had sent.)

WIBTA if I called up the the parent company to complain about R? I find it to be incredibly unprofessional that 

(1) They are essentially demanding an apology for a valid complaint that was submitted. 

(2) They put my co-worker in the awkward position of asking them to relay this message.

On top of this cross contamination is STILL a major issue and there are many people in my office who will not utilize the cafeteria because of food allergies and the way they handle food. I, personally, don't have food allergies and thus have continued using the cafeteria but after today I do not intend to do so."
1564,b5f3gt,"WIBTA if I turn my ex in for not paying child support? My ex doesn’t pay her child support. She can afford to, she just doesn’t. She has monthly contempt hearings where she claims she’s disabled and works limited hours. She convinced her doctor too so the court’s hands are tied. She also has a fraudulent claim open with SSI. 

She works for herself and her clients pay cash under the table. She leased space at my business last year and used my front desk staff for scheduling, so I have proof she’s lying. I’m considering taking it to the prosecutor. He’s a friend of a friend; if I tell him what I know he can subpoena my business records so it won’t look vindictive on my part. 

Reasons to turn her in:

1. She was abusive when we were together and has been even more abusive since I terminated her contract with my business due to her poor behavior. 

2. She extorted $8,000 from me and made false claims to an agency that oversees my business, resulting in thousands of dollars in attorney fees to defend myself. 

3. She took our dog (he’s legally hers, but I helped raise him and can provide a much better home) and jerks me around when I want to see him. I want him back. She’s not feeding him right, she gives him marijuana, he’s skinny and malnourished and I’m worried for him. 

4. She’s committing fraud by not paying her taxes and if her SSI claim goes through she’ll be stealing directly from all of us. As someone who pays a lot in taxes each year, this pisses me off. 

Reasons I’m hesitating:

1. My motives aren’t pure. I’m angry and seeking revenge and that really isn’t my style nor a good reason to do it. 

2. The child support judgment was unfair. She was a stay at home mom with no income. Her ex controlled the money so he got an attorney, she didn’t so they destroyed her in court. She’s been hiding from the system since. 

3. The money won’t help her child. Her ex makes twice her income. The last time the court seized her money, he spent it on a cruise. 

4. She’s talked about not wanting to be alive. The court will likely take everything she owns (which isn’t much tbh) and put her in jail for awhile. With nothing left to lose I’m afraid it will push her over the edge and I don’t want that on my conscience. 

5. She’s planning to move out of state soon. If I turn her in, she’ll be stuck here longer. 

My staff can’t stand her, they’ve all had to deal with her shenanigans and are encouraging me to turn her in. She’s still playing games with us, harassing us with fake social media accounts and so on. 

I’m really torn and I’ve been agonizing over this for months. Mostly I just want the dog back before he dies in her “care” and I feel like she’ll have little choice but to sell him to me when this all comes down. She’ll be hard up for money and I’m the only person she knows who has any. She’s said she would sell him to me on many occasions but always backs out with some lame excuse; she’s clearly using my love for him to manipulate me. "
1565,e7epnl,"WIBTA For not giving my ex-girlfriend her stuff back? About a year ago, my now-ex girlfriend (F21) decided she wanted to study abroad in Peru over the fall. The program would be about 4 months, but I (M22) wasn't worried - partly because it would be selfish of me to do so, partly because the relationship itself was very strong. Fast forward to the beginning of August, and the day came for her to leave. We had a nice goodbye in the morning, exchanging lots of tears and presents, including a decision to exchange some clothes and other things to help remind each other. When she left that afternoon, she made it very clear that she was invested in this relationship - three years at this point. As context might tell you, that aged like a fine milk. 

8 days into the trip, she tells me, in no uncertain terms, that being in Peru has led her to feel as though she needs to ""truly find herself,"" and she ""can't be tied down by anything at home"" to do so. She ignores any explaining I try to do - not even to talk her out of her feelings, but to encourage her to wait a little longer into the trip to make that kind of big decision - I've always felt it's a bad idea to make any kind of big choices so soon after any kind of big shift or upheaval in your life (death of a family member, move to college - in this case, flying to live in a different hemespheric country for half a year). She proceeds to ignore me for a day, and stops sharing her location. The following day, I submit that: whatever she's feeling, she needs to do, right or wrong, because if not now it will come up again later. She explains how she will ""always love me"" and intends to ""come back to me when she finds who she is"" and ""I'm her soulmate"". She explains that she'd like to keep in touch, but isn't really sure how to proceed. 

She follows these sentiments by ghosting me for four months. 

Now she's back, and I have yet to hear from her. At the least, I assumed she'd contact me to retrieve her stuff and return mine - after all, she ended the relationship, so I feel that it's her responsibility to do any ""reaching out"" and organize any returns. But still no word from her, and I get a strong sense that she's waiting for me to come forward. Admittedly, I'm still pretty torn up (and salty) over the whole thing, and texting her first would give away all my leverage in how upset I am at how she treated me. To this end, even if she does reach out now (weeks after her return to the states), I'm tempted to give her the same treatment and ghost away. As a result of this, she wouldn't be getting her stuff back - a sweatshirt, pair of sweatpants, a book of psychology notes she had lent me...nothing expensive, but all still her stuff. If I don't respond, and don't end up returning anything, WIBTA?"
1566,cg0axg,"AITA for being crude in front of a child? Almost every year since I [23F] was kid, my father has gone on a kayaking trip down in southern Utah. The trip has since evolved to involve the other adults in our family (i.e my aunts and uncles). It has always been the “let loose”, party trip. My dad’s sisters are Mormon, but their husbands are not and the trip was an excuse to go crazy and drink. It was an “adult” trip from the outset. I looked forward to this trip for years as it was the only non-LDS trip my family goes on and I was allowed to go when I was 20.

Last year, my (LDS) aunt surprised everyone by bringing her year old son [13M]on the trip. My dad specifically told her repeatedly it would still be an “adult” trip, but she said he could handle it. On the trip, there was still alcohol and I completely admit to talking about “inappropriate” things after my cousin went to sleep or when he wasn’t around. However, voices carry and he (and my aunt) definitely overheard things.

At a baby shower in June, my aunt made a big deal of pulling me aside away from everybody else and telling me that she was planning a trip this year, wanted me to go, but that my “sexual” talk last year was too much and wouldn’t be tolerated this year. She was very upset with my behavior. I told her I was fine with being “family friendly” when it’s pre-established, but last year was still an “adult” trip. Upset, I left the baby shower early because I didn’t want to cry in front of everyone.

She later text me that she hoped I didn’t leave because of her and it spiraled into an argument. Her POV is that because her son was there it should have been obvious that behavior would change. I again explained that I was fine being filtered on pre-established family friendly trips, but last year was not one. If I went this year, I would be fine filtering, for example. 

I’m also angry because she planned this year’s kayaking trip with EVERYone else without my father’s — who started the trip in the first place — schedule and now he can’t come. They also expect to use all of his equipment (he’s bought all the kayaks/paddles). 

At first, I said I didn’t want to go, but a cousin of mine wanted me to and my father said it would be worse if I didn’t. So I text her that I was planning on going and got the time off, but she has not texted me back. I finally called an uncle to see what was going on after a few days and he said it would be best if I didn’t go because she was really upset. She has also gone on to tell everyone that I said I hate her, which isn’t true at all. It’s all being blown out of proportion. 

I’m so tired of being the bad guy. I’m so incredibly frustrated with the situation. Am I the asshole? Should I have filtered in front of her son? I feel like I’m being blamed for her putting her child in an adult situation."
1567,ay14q8,"AITA if I tell coworker I won't drive him anymore with no notice. I've been driving a co worker to work for the past 6 months, he pays me 20$ every two weeks to drive him. We both started working at this place at the exact same time, and in that time I have bought myself a motorcycle and a car. He's done nothing for himself but smoke a ton of weed and call in sick 2-3 times a week. 

&#x200B;

Now I work 40+ hours a week and I am a full time student, so I have classes 4 days a week, not to mention the time I spend doing assignments and studying. Needless to say I have VERY little personal time, basically no social life to speak of. I've recently started dating someone who lives 20 minutes away from my house but only a few minutes away from work. So in order to spend time with him I'm often having to go there before work, then drive back to my city to pick up this co worker and drive another 25 minutes back to work. Or I'll be planning my day around it so I end up not having social time, and back in the city to be able to drive him in. So it's been pretty inconvenient, but I've been managing. However, often times I'll plan my day around being in the city to drive this person, only to find out hes not going to work. I'll be driving back to the city to pick this co worker and receive a text from them saying they aren't going to work. Great, so now I've wasted gas and my time for nothing. Anyways this is really starting to annoy me so I told him this and that he needs to start looking for a new ride, he knew this was never a permanent arrangement anyways as I'll be riding my motorcycle as soon as it warms up. He's done nothing to find a new ride, and I planned on giving him a dead line of 2 weeks before I stop driving him. But yet again I planned my day around driving this guy in and he called in again. So would I be the asshole if I just tell him that I can't drive him anymore and not give him the courtesy of the 2 weeks notice? 

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I drive in a co worker and he often calls in sick to work which is inconveniencing me greatly. I want to just tell him to fuck off and not give him the 2 weeks notice I had originally planned to let him find a new ride. "

I’m an artist myself, so I like to support other artists trying to make a living. He is pretty widely followed, with 50K followers on IG. I noticed that he was selling flash sheets. I sent him a DM and told him that I was interested in buying one. He linked me to his BigCartel page, and I purchased a print. Told him transaction was completed, and he said he would box it and ship it right away! I left it alone, and about 3 weeks later, sent him a DM asking about it. He said “that’s weird. It should have shipped. Let me check. Oh sorry. I forgot! Let me ship it now. I’ll throw in some stickers! Sorry dude!” No problem. Shit happens. 

Another month goes by, I hit him up again, and he says that something is “weird with transit.” And he will “ship another one.” Okay. Whatever. Another month and i ask again. No response. It’s now been 6 months and I’m starting to get pissed. I get a DM from a random user on IG asking if I had purchased art from this user, but not received it. I said yes. They informed me that they were also in the same boat, as well as 50+ people. I became furious, and contacted the artist and called him out. He began to call me a **liar** and say that I received the art, and that I just wanted free shit. I began an investigation and contacted the other people. After I took screen shots of the 30+ people I spoke with, confirming that he ripped them off for hundreds to thousands of dollars, I posted it on my IG, tagged him, and put him on blast. 

I follow him on a ghost account. He makes new posts advertising new art and says “COMMENT IF YOU WANT IT!” And I’ll personally message anyone who comments advising them not to buy. And if they have already purchased, I’ll advise them to get a refund. I’ve been doing this for the past month, and he has noticed. He sent me a message crying saying that he has lost so much revenue over the past few weeks that he can barely afford rent, bla bla bla. “Please stop. I’ll send you whatever you want.” Someone else told me I should just let it go. I’m sorry, but in my eyes he’s a fucking thief. Reap what you sow. Am I the asshole for viciously coming for his “clients” and stopping at nothing to make sure he starves to death before ripping someone else off?

TLDR; buy art from seemingly cool dude, never sent art. Turns out he is a con artist. I now personally stop at nothing to make sure he receives zero new business.

I used my “second account” to post this because I wanted opinions. I’m not using this for karma or upvotes. I’ll probably end up deleting this post TBH. I am just in a moral dilemma because I know he is fucking people over,  so I fucked him over too. I’ve recently got an update from the other user on IG that after I made the post, he came into his tattoo shop, packed up over night and up and left over night. Won’t take anyone’s calls. I completely humiliated this dude, and now he has no job. I guess this is an example of reaping what you sow, but at the same time, I suspect that he is addicted to heroin....thus why I am posting here. It doesn’t justify destroying this business (he does legit sell to some people) ... does it? 

I am in a moral dilemma and just need feedback if I am being an asshole back to an asshole.

We're both 22, and been together 7 months and ever since I started bringing her around my group of friends she started to poke fun of one of my boys for being short. He's like 5'5 on a good day but we don't ever really make fun of him ever for it because its just a shitty thing to do. She did though and would say he's a midget in most countries, can he drive without a booster seat etc. All this stuff infront of our group of friends when we're out and at first we laughed of course but it got super weird when she kept saying shit like almost every time we hung out. He would usually just laugh along or just say you bitch jokingly but I could tell it got to him of course because it was getting to be too much. I spoke with her about this and she just said she was trying to be one of the boys and it was just banter, but I told her if its just banter why don't you joke about any of the other guys then? She just said short guys are more funny to poke at and shit like that, I told her straight up to not do this shit anymore after like 2-3 months of it. My short friend went away on a semester abroad and came back about a month ago so we all went out since we haven't seen him in a while and my GF came along and she starts with the short jokes, it gets so awkward because she's insulting his height for no reason. My other friends leave with my shorter one to hit up a different bar and I told my gf we should go to my place and talk.

When we got to my place I was pretty annoyed she'd act this way still and told her how would she feel if I made fun of one of her chubby friends for being fat and she said its not the same thing and other bs. She had a smirk on her face the whole time and that pissed me off so I just told her its done and to gtfo out of my place and to take her things. She started yelling and shit and said how could I break up with her over jokes with about a friend and I didn't want to hear it. She called me a dumbass douche and a variety of other insults.

1571,diadcv,"AITA for locking the cats out of our room? Me and my gf live in a one bedroom apartment with a small dog and 2 cats. The dog is a cuddler and would lay in bed all day if you let him so no issues there. But the 2 cats are another story.

They are both kind of chunky so at the vets recommendation, we started them on a diet a few months ago. We've finally weaned them down to an appropriate amount of food. But they feel like it's not enough.

We will give them their portion right before bed and the next time they eat is for breakfast. But they usually finish their night food in the middle of the night. They had been respectful enough to wait until sunrise before waking us up but over the last couple weeks they've not even been waiting until sunrise.

Now instead of waking us up at 7:30 or 8am, they wake us up at 6. Since I get home from work at 11pm, this doesnt give me enough time to get a full 8 hours. They wake us up by standing on our faces and licking us and meowing until we feed them.

So today I got woken up early again and I was so mad that I acted like I was going to the kitchen to feed them, and when they followed me out there, I went back to the bedroom and shut the door. They were still crying outside but the door is so thick you couldn't even hear them.

Well today my gf happed to oversleep and was late to work. I guess her phone alarm didnt go off like it normally does. She was kinda upset at me Locking the cats out since they ""act as a secondary alarm system"". From my point of view, since I have to go to bed later, it's important I get my full nights sleep. I can not simply sleep in longer because once I awake when my gf gets out of bed at 7:30 or 8, I can not fall back asleep. She also doesnt like restricting the cats movement but they still have 3 other rooms and it's only for 8 hours.

So was I right to lock the cats out? And bonus if you can give me info on how to get them to stop begging and get used to their new feeding schedule."
1572,e4ggx2,"AITA for refusing to take back my shift? I work in a bar and we recently got our holiday shifts, I'm relatively new to this place and I hadn't been asked about any preferences over the main days (Christmas Day, NYE, etc.)

I was put on for NYE which I wasn't too happy about since my girlfriend wanted me to have it off because she did as well, so I asked my manager if there was any way he could get it off for me, but no worries if not. He said that another member of staff had agreed to cover it, I double and triple checked with this staff member to make sure it was definitely okay, since I realise asking someone to cover a shift like that is no small ask, she confirmed that it was all okay.

So that same day I booked tickets to a NYE party for myself and my girlfriend and told her we were sorted.

Fast forward to the following night, I get a message from the co-worker saying she could no longer cover the shift as she had a family party on the night and that I would have to take my shift back, I told her I would have to speak to our manager but she was insistent that because it was initially my shift, it was my responsibility.

Our manager wasn't very happy about the situation and told us to work it out among ourselves, but that someone would have to work it. Her argument the whole way through has remained the same, but I think the opposite, in that the responsibility falls to the last person who agreed to work.

Throwback to this Halloween. I was going to hang out with my best friends of 12 years. We’re all 17-18 years old. We were conflicted if we should go trick or treating since we’re a bit old for it. One of my best friends (calling him Nick) really wanted to go get candy, so we agreed to go out and trick or treat. My girlfriend tells me that her Halloween plans fell through so I invite her to come with us. She asks if we’re going to be trick or treating or just hanging out. I tell her probably a little of both. She explains to me that she thinks it’s immature and inappropriate to trick or treat at this age. She believes that a group of teenage boys asking for candy is scary and disruptive. I tell her that we probably won’t trick or treat much, and she should come. She agrees.

So my friends and I meet up, and Nick goes up to a couple of stores, we wait behind him, suddenly feeling slightly self-conscious. My girlfriend seems pretty uncomfortable and mutters to me that we’re scaring kids and should leave. I tell her that I’m not trick or treating, just Nick and that he can do what he wants. As he goes up to another house, she says to Nick, “okay, you finally got your candy, are you done?” And she made some other remarks about him seeming like an 8-year-old. He didn’t say anything back. I regret not defending him there. We stop trick or treating shortly after and continue to walk to a park.  I begin to talk about Star wars with Nick. After about 5 minutes, my girlfriend says, “okay, can we talk about literally anything else other than Star Wars?” We both go quiet. After a bit, we see a donut shop and Nick says we should get some, to which she (apparently) replied, “if you want one so bad you can get one yourself” (she denies saying this, Nick said she did, and I never heard). We eventually end up back where we started the night and he leaves.

The next day, Nick and I had a good conversation about why he was upset. He was mad that she made him feel like an 8-year-old and kept shutting him down during the night. Additionally, Nick felt that she was a guest and didn’t have the right to take so much control alongside her rudeness.

So I sat my girlfriend down and told her I was frustrated with how she treated him. She got pretty mad at me for agreeing with him. She thinks that Nick is a misogynist that can’t deal with a woman who voices her opinion. Her evidence for this is that he has a submissive girlfriend who is very shy and that he got mad when she took control. She says her vocal criticisms about trick or treating being immature are logical and that she has a right to say it to his face because she is right.

I told her that she’s wrong, that he’s not sexist, and she was rude. We got into a huge argument about it. It was never fully resolved, and yesterday, we got into it again. AITA for taking my best friend’s side in this? Is she right?"

So...I work a split shift at work 5 days a week, and the weekend i desperately needed comes. Time for a little relaxation and a little time to catch up on a little bit of cleaning around the house. I get a call from my best friend asking me to come over as she does every weekend. She knows my shifts and still calls very early into the morning asking me to come over. So I tell her I just woke up and I don't really feel like going anywhere and I don't feel very good in general, coming over means me watching and caring for her child the entire time. Don't get me wrong I love my friend and my godson but I really feel like crap after a bad night at work. She tries the whole but you love me shtick like a guilt trip, and again I say I don't feel like it so I say maybe another time. She didn't get an attitude, but her tone of voice changed like I did something wrong and had made her upset. I said goodbye and hung up. Am I the Asshole?

1578,bj8zau,"AITA for breaking contact with a dear friend because of his rude wife? So one of my (29M) best friends A (30M) got married in November 2018. For about a year and a half since November 2016, when he was dating his now wife (let’s call her B, 30F) things were going well. I became good friends with her too and all 3 of us hung out regularly. 

I started noticing changes in B’s behavior toward me as their wedding approached. We were at a party, she approaches me, tells me she finds me irritating and before I could ask for an explanation or elaboration she walks away. I never brought it up, she was clearly tipsy at that point and I let it be.

A month after this incident, I went to her hometown for their wedding and she was openly rude multiple times in front of friends and even in front of her family. I again didn’t confront. Didn’t want to add any extra stress to the event. 

After their marriage A was hanging out at my place (I had a couple of friends over and we lost track of time). It was quite late, she sent me a couple of angry texts on how he should come home right away and he didn’t tell her he was going to hang out at my place until after he reached my place. His phone was dead apparently and he wasn’t responding to her texts so she decided to unload on me. 

After all these instances, I decided to keep my distance and hang out with my friend only on social dos because every time I tried hanging out, B was with him and I didn’t want to ask him to not bring her. (nothing untoward happened during these hang out sessions, she was well behaved but I just didn’t get the sense of camaraderie with her anymore). 

He feels I am avoiding him and spoke to B about this, she texted me saying I am being a neglectful friend and I should take initiative, now she has taken up on herself to make us spend more time together. I am dodging these requests, this is surely affecting my friendship with my friend and I feel like an asshole here. What do you guys think?

Edit: so a common question I am being asked is whether I spoke to my friend?

Yes, I did. After I received the text from B where she wanted me to take more initiative and to stop being a neglectful friend. I informed him that I have not being hanging out much because, at times, I find B rude. He didn’t ask for details. He just assumed that I was talking about the times she had been rude to me in her hometown and he had witnessed a couple of those instances. He urged me to give her another chance because she was stressed out due to the wedding, I didn’t give him other examples where she had been rude."
1579,d7xicn,"AITA for the way I’ve tried to set boundaries at work TL;DR Home Health nurse, patients treating me like Uber, have I gone too far with boundary setting.

I’m a home health nurse, I drive to see 6-8 patients a day over a wide region, and each visit can take 20-90 minutes.
Lately, maybe because of our very on demand world with Uber etc, patients have become unreasonable with scheduling demands that I don’t feel are appropriate. It used to be there were always those 1-2 patients, now it’s the majority. What should be 8 hr days turn into 12 hr days, 7 days/wk catching up on visits because my schedule becomes so inefficient, zigzagging all over town bending over backward to accommodate the whims of people who should be treating this like a medical appt but instead treat me like a concierge service.

Examples: Wanting me to come at a specific time for a non medical reason such as when they prefer to have lunch, that’s when they watch the news, they are going to the mall/bank/etc, the plumber is coming. Another thing that really gets me is if they want to reschedule for an earlier or later time they’ll say “that way you can have the afternoon off”, or “you get to sleep in”. These people think I fall from the sky just for them and don’t realize I will work the full day regardless of what time I see them.
Taking calls or dealing with other business while I’m there and expecting me to wait. Actual examples: booking a flight for 30 minutes, stopping a visit to have a couch picked up by upholstery company and complaining how ‘inconvenient’ it is that I arrived at the time I we scheduled.
Not allowing a 1 hour window of arrival and refusing to let me in if “late”.

So now this is what I do:  when we schedule our next visit they have 2 choices of arrival windows that I give them based on knowing where I’ll be when, and whether the visit is time specific. UNLESS they have a medical appt, they get no exceptions. If they can’t accommodate I tell the office to restaff since they are too busy for a nurse, and also they may need to be re-evaluated for whether they need HH since they aren’t prioritizing it.

if they take a call and it goes over 5 minutes, or deal with any other issue for more than 5 minutes, I leave.

I don’t chat much anymore, since the more we get to know each other I feel the more they can lean on my empathy toward their situation and then I end up agreeing to accommodate them. 

One of the agencies I work with has complained that I’m refusing too many patients now, saying I need to be more flexible. The last issue was a patient texting me an hour before our visit (scheduled for 1pm) that they won’t be home til 6pm so they need me to come after that. In traffic its an hour drive each way. No, I said I’ll be home making dinner at that time, the agency can send another nurse who works evenings or the caregiver can do the wound care. I’m not a 24/7 on call service."
1580,44qtnf,"AITA for not agreeing on a price for the kitchen of the guy who helped me get a flat? Ok so this one has a lot of factors but I'll try to keep it short.

Last year my gf and I decided to move in together, but seeing as we're both university students without much of an income, it was difficult to find a landlord who would agree to have us as tenants.

Eventually we got word from a family friend. Her coworker was moving out of his flat and he'd show us around.

He is a very nice guy and I think he liked us, too, because he told his brother, who owns the flat, that we seem like nice and responsible people.

Here's where it gets tricky. The flat he was moving into already had a kitchen installed, meaning he couldn't take his old one with him, so he asked if we'd buy it off him. It's about two years old and he'd paid 4000€ for it. He told us his price was a negotiable 3000€, which is far too much for us, but we agreed to negotiate a price for it, should his brother let us sign the lease.

To our surprise, we actually got the flat. The landlord told us he didn't care if we bought his brother's kitchen or not. When it came to negotiating a price, we could only get it down to 2000€, though. Still too much for us, especially since you can get small kitchens for like 800.

We told him we'd buy one ourselves, while he put his on ebay for 2800. We did, in fact, buy a nice kitchen for 800.

About 10 days before moving out, I got a text from the guy, saying nobody will buy his kitchen and he'd sell it to us for 1500€.

I responded that we'd already bought one, and cancelling the order will cost us a quarter of the retail price as compensation for the store, so 200€.
Should we take his kitchen instead, we'd only make a profit if he'd sell it to us for 600. We were, however, feeling a bit sorry for him so we made the offer to buy his for 1000, effectively costing us 1200 because of the compensation.

He said he'd think about it.

The next day he sent me a text saying his parents think 1000€ is not enough, so they'll buy it themselves and leave it in the flat, letting us use it.

In the end, we only had to pay the compensation for the store. 
While initially I was quite pleased with my negotiating skills (From 3000 down to 200), I was (and am still) not sure if I am the asshole here.

Friends and family say it's his fault for being too greedy. They might be biased though, obviously. 

If it helps my cause, I'd want to add that after living in the flat for a while, it became clear that the kitchen isn't really worth the 4000 he'd paid for it. The appliances are very loud, for example, and there are other minor faults here and there.

Still, this has been bugging me for months: AITA?"
1581,c8cuke,"AITA if I don't teach my sister how to ride a bike? My (f19) sister (6) and I have a genetic skin condition called epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS). We inherited the disease from our dad, who also suffers from it. In layman's terms, the condition causes your skin to be much more fragile than an average person's. Any normal amount of friction, heat or contact may cause painful blisters and scarring. Although simplex is the least severe form, that doesn't mean it's all fun and games.

I think my parents had good intentions when they let me to do pretty much anything my friends did as a child. They didn't want me to feel limited because of my skin. However, now that I'm older, I really wish they had told me ""no"" every now and then. My hands and feet, which usually suffer most of the damage in this condition, are significantly scarred up. All but three of my nails have fallen off, and the ones that grow back are brittle and ugly. Had I learned to slow down on physical activities earlier, I believe my skin would be doing a lot better today. My new dermatologist recently told me as much.

One of the things that caused me a great deal of pain was riding my bike. I loved doing it with my friends, but I remember my condition aggravating after each ride. The palms of my hands, my feet and even my butt would be burning. Yet my parents never said ""no"". They would drain my blisters, bandage me up and let me do it all over again. This is the kind of a thing I'm talking about when I say I wish they'd scolded me and denied me more.

Now my parents want me to teach my little sister how to ride a bike because she's the only one in her kindergarten group still unable to do it. However thinking back on all the damage that could've been prevented if I was never allowed to hop on one (just one among many measures that could've been taken), I don't feel comfortable helping her out with this. My parents think I'm overreacting, they don't want my sister to feel left out just because ""her hands might look slightly different when she's older"". They don't get how hard it is, though. My dad has similar issues but he's a guy who can't fully understand the pressure on girls to have pretty nails and soft skin. I got teased a great deal for my lack of nails, scars and weird toes and fingers growing up.

I might be to personally invested in this situation for an objective judgment, so tell me Reddit: am I the asshole for refusing to teach my sister something that will likely do her more harm than good in the long run?"

My boyfriend has a friend that he's been very good friends with for a long time who I would also have considered a friend.

She went home.

1583,cpw7uq,"AITA for banning my mother from my wedding, which she paid for, because she disapproves of my husband? I’m gay, my (widowed) mother is very religious, you can see where this is going. I came out to her when I was 19, I had been with the same man for 2 years then. Mom demanded I break up with him and start dating girls if I wanted to keep living at home. Bf was still in the closet and living with his parents too, so I ended up couch surfing for 3 months before getting back on my feet. During that time, I cried myself to sleep every night and hoped I could repair my relationship with my mother, but she never budged and demanded I break up with my bf every time we talked.

In the years that followed, I tried to maintain a relationship with mom, but she kept trying to “turn me straight” at every occasion. The last time I saw her until recently, I was 22 and I had been invited for dinner; when I arrived, there was her priest there and mom happily told me he would “cure me” of my homosexuality. I got up and left without a word. We went no contact for years.

I got married last week. Still to the same man I had been dating when I was 17, we’ve been together 9 years total and he’s perfect. On his advice, I extended one last branch to mom by telling her about the wedding 6 months ago. She first tried to make me call it off, but she eventually crumpled and admitted she had set money aside since I was born for my future wedding. Of it, she gave me over 25,000€. Until then, we were planning a tiny ceremony with just a few close friends, but with that money we upgraded the wedding by renting a vineyard, a catering service and a much better cake, and we were so happy! I was mostly happy mom was finally accepting my sexuality. We had several heart-to-heart conversations, we cried and hugged a lot and I was very glad.

On the day of the wedding, things went south. As I was getting ready early in the morning, I stumbled on mom crying in the bathroom (we were in a rented house together with mom and my husband). What I first thought were tears of joy were actually from sadness and anguish. She admitted she found the idea of me marrying a man revolting, and she could put on a fake smile while it was all in the future, but she couldn’t believe the wedding day was there. I was dumbfounded and asked why she gave me the money, and she said she wouldn’t miss my wedding for anything in the world, even though she didn’t approve of it or accept me - no matter if I married a man, a dog or an inanimate object… I took that as a punch in the gut. I got really angry and told her she was not welcome there and to go home. It turned into a shouting/crying match but she left.

I couldn’t enjoy myself during the wedding, and I still feel empty inside. The happiest time of my life was tainted forever, and I don’t think I will ever be able to talk to my mother the same way. I also feel *dirty* for having the wedding paid for by her. AITA?"
1584,a8wxbt,"AITA for wanting to be left alone? TLDR; I need to be alone sometimes and my mom says that I am being rude, selfish, and thinks that something is wrong when I just need time to decompress. AITA?

I just finished nursing school about a week ago. Something I learned about myself over the past year is that I need a day or two in between finishing classes and going on break. Without time to myself, I bring my stress and other baggage home and I am an asshole to the people around me. I give myself a day or two to journal and allow myself to decompress basically. 

Now, my mother specifically does not seem to understand this concept. I have explained to her multiple times that I just need to be by myself to detach from school. I clarify that I’m not mad at her or anyone else. I’m completely fine. 

She has continually been saying things like, “You’re not being yourself”, and, “Why don’t you want to talk to the ones that love you the most?”

Similarly to separating school from home, I have to separate myself from my family and just be alone for a day or even a couple hours. I live with 9 people (7 siblings and 2 parents...yes, all my siblings are from the same parents) and sometimes I need to be by myself, which is hard in such a large family. I think that is pretty reasonable to want to be deprecate, especially at my age. (22M)

Yesterday, I told my mom that I needed to be left alone because I am socially exhausted and she started back asking all these questions again. I keep having to clarify that I’m ok and I’m not mad at her, which is fine. I understand that she is my mom and that she’s wants the best for me. However, after explaining myself she insists something is wrong and that I’m being rude and selfish.

This has happened multiple times over the past year and I don’t know how to feel about it all.

I'm gay, and I've come out to my parents about 10  years ago. They... didn't take it well. I was forced into church therapy and my parents became emotionally and sometimes physically abusive as the years went by. It was this whole thing that led me down a spiral of depression and suicidal thoughts and it was the darkest period of my life. Until the day I started playing along.

1586,bazmul,"AITA for asking my doctor to leave? I have stage four cancer and receive chemo every Monday. During these sessions my doctor pops by to chat about symptoms and we can discuss treatment plans and such. These visits are always held in an open room with other patients sitting next to you and nurses drawing blood at the same time. 

The past few weeks I’ve been experiencing some rather annoying (TMI) symptoms and radiotherapy was put on the table as a possibility. All I know about radiotherapy I had learned from my own research, and was a bit overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information. I mentioned that I wasn’t sold on going through with it on top of my chemotherapy as I’m already pretty wiped out and don’t see much benefit. 

I had a visit with another doctor on my team who really stressed that radiotherapy seemed the best option. After this, I spoke with my nurse about it and decided I would like more information before deciding. 

My main-doctor is a very busy woman, I get that, and these weekly visits are normally very short just to make sure I’m healthy enough to get the go-ahead for treatment. Last week we had planned she would stop by for a bit longer than the usual 5-10 minutes so that we could discuss radiotherapy more in-depth, and she could outline her exact plans. When she came in I had a notepad full of questions and I was ready and prepared. When I brought it up she said it wasn’t on the table anymore and we shouldn’t worry about it. I mentioned a few things my nurse had said regarding the treatment and she immediately shoots those down, claiming the nurse was ‘completely wrong’ and ‘didn’t know what she was talking about’. 

To me this felt rather rude, and probably could have been handled better. 

This morning she popped in again and I stressed my symptoms were starting to affect my mental health. I was just asking if there was anything we could do to help. She brought up radiotherapy as a possibility...I was pretty mad at this point, as she told me previously it was off the table. So I brought up some of the questions I had before and was constantly met with, “we’ll discuss that when it comes to it,” or something of the sort. 

I then reminded her I wasn’t sold on radiotherapy as a whole, and that I wanted all the information before making a decision to go forward. I do not want to be bombarded right before with information and feel overwhelmed. (Which has happened a couple times in the past). She got a kind of annoyed look and started just going into auto-pilot and started describing the process of radiotherapy and when I would ask questions she would interrupt me and say she’ll get to it. 

I asked her to leave as I was just too frustrated to listen.

1587,chr65e,"AITAH For not wanting a big wedding? Am on mobile, first post cause I just found this sub a few weeks ago.

So me and my bf of 4 years decided to get married. It was a casual thing with no big proposal or fancy night out. We were on vacation, hanging out after a long day of hiking, and somehow the conversation led to marriage. We decided that we wanted to get married mutually because we don't want to be with anyone else and wanted to officially define our relationship as a couple. 

I never really thought about marriage, and he had been in a marriage before that ended really bad, so we didn't want rush anything and always said that if we did get married it would be a mutual agreement as opposed to someone just asking. We were both ready and we have a great relationship so it just makes sense.

We told our family that we were getting married and my mom jumped on it. She started planning venues and asking about color choices and what kind of food we were planning on having. Basically trying to plan the whole thing (with extended family, friends, ect.) and when I told her that none of that would be happening, she flipped out on me. She said that I didn't care about anyone but myself and that it was a huge slap in the face to her for not wanting her there. She also said that it was selfish because my step dad would never have the chance to ""give anyone away.""

1588,bat1cf,"AITA for asking my (ex?) Bf to ask his mother to put away a photo in her own home? Me and my (currently on a break? Ex? God knows) boyfriend had been dating for a year and a half and lived together. 
We've had some issues with his past relationship (of 7 years), things like him having photos of her on his phone, but not one of me, not deleting her stuff/accounts from his stuff after 2 and a half years of her having moved 6 hours away, and hiding from me that he was talking to her weekly on the phone. I blame all of this on him not considering my emotions, as I know it's not deliberate (except for the keeping from me that he was talking to her. She was having problems with her mental health and he was ""there"" for her... during that time I put myself on medication and in therapy alone for my own issues.)

He's very introverted, and despite him claiming how cruel she was to him, and how ""she only ever bitches at him"", I feel bad for being upset because she is the only other person he really talks to. I told him I had no problem with having a relationship with his ex (which is why it was weird that he kept the fact that he was talking to her from me). But that things needed to be handled differently. One of the things I brought up was this issue.

Although he doesn't visit like, every week or anything, he's very close with his mother, and shes a really nice person. I've been to dinner with her a handful of times, pretty much whenever he went. But the thing that bothered me was the framed photo of my bf and his ex holding each other at a wedding sitting on her end table. I definitely understand that she doesn't have a ton of pictures of him (he doesn't like to take them), but this picture is them from torso up with his arms wrapped around her and them pressed all close together. It's a very affectionate picture and it makes me uncomfortable.

The first time I came over I didn't think anything of it, because obviously I was just meeting this woman for the first time. But the picture never went away. Even after we moved in together.

I asked him to ask his mom about the picture, but I also feel incredibly out of line asking a woman (by proxy of her son) to remove a photo from her own home. After months, he never mentioned it to her, because he ""really didn't want to have the conversation with her.""

It's not on the wall or anything, it's a stand up frame on her end table. I don't know why that makes a difference but it seems to. Maybe it's the ease at which she could have easily put it away before I came over, and easily put it back after I left if she really wanted it. But then again, I genuinely don't know if I'm out of line for expecting that. It's just a picture.

Am (was) I the asshole for asking this of him? Am (was) I the asshole for even implying that I have some sort of control over what pictures this woman has in her own home?

EDIT: I want to clarify that this is absolutely not the sole reason we're currently apart."
1589,dgy24d,"AITA For holding a grudge and not talking to my sister for taking a Christmas present? So to start my older sister and I were close growing up, but as she got older and gained more freedom, she made bad decisions. All this culminated in her leaving home, wrecking her car, leaving us (her family) without a word. 

Over the next few years, the only contact we would get is mean emails were she blamed my Nanna for everything. 

After a couple of years, and a baby, she calmed down and apologized for what she did and said. My Nanna forgave her and they resumed contact. I however did not. 

I first saw her 4 years after she left and she was angry with me for not already having a baby and not being pregnant right now. When I told her I didn't even have a boyfriend, she said ""That doesn't matter. Just find some random guy and get pregnant."" She was being completely serious. She said it was only fair because she and my oldest sister already had kids. 

The next time I saw her was at Christmas time last year. She came by early morning with her kid and boyfriend. They opened presents and during the entire time, my sister tried ordering my younger sisters around for food and watching her kid. 

They left to drop her kid off at his dads and came back for Christmas supper. And she literally ate most the deviled eggs I made so my uncle couldn't have any. He was sad. 

After supper we went to open presents and my Nanna opened my present that I gave her. It was a bath set. My sister saw it and after finding out it was my nannas said ""Oh I really like it, can I have it?"" My Nanna was never good at public fights so she let her have it. I didn't find out until after she left, and I was mad. I mean my uncles gave her $200 cash, but she had to have my nannas present as well. 

I confronted her about it this past summer and she still didn't see what she did wrong. She thought I was overreacting and that it was just a bad set. She apologized but only to get me to shut up, which I did because my little sisters were getting scared. 

I decided not to talk to her until she figures out what she did wrong. I mean you don't just ask for someone's Christmas presents, the second they open them, right?

She also has an outstanding student loan that has not been paid off that my wife signed for.  Cherry on top:  My wife quit her job at one point to watch her first born because she and the husband were having money issues.  I remained quiet as it was her family and I trusted she knew what she was doing.  Worst part?  I’ve had to deal with this type of behavior for the last seven years where we are always picking up the tab or buying the kids clothes because they NEED it.  We have also loaned them quite a bit of money which we’ll probably never see.

Last week she and the hubby had some time to kill before heading over to a friend's pool party.  Sis in law immediately begins complaining about money and how she is so tired and hasn't had a moment to rest all week.  I started out calmly by asking her why don’t you create a budget for both time management and money?  It was as if I nudged a ripe pimple.  She blew up accusing me of not knowing how difficult her life is and to stay in my lane.  That was the red button – With the fury of a thousand Ned Flanders I let seven years of built up frustration spear her in the eyeballs.  Short of the long is I informed her of her shit habits with time and money and she needs to lock it up especially with a third child on the way and to figure her shit out because we are not going to be around forever.  It is unfair to ask even family for help when you yourself have not exhausted all options to cut costs and do your best to make do and live within your means.

Wife thought I was an asshole and mean.  I disagree – no one has ever said anything to her and the underlying behavior needs to be corrected as it’s impacting everyone.  Before anyone asks, the kids were not present.  Sidenote:  My wife and I are savers and try to put away as much as possible for early retirement.  We have a goal in mind.  This has been taking away from it for the last seven years.

**Edit:**  for those saying no one wants unsolicited advice, she has come crying to us about how to consolidate her debt and hide it from her husband.  Twice actually.

Sis-in-law and Brother-in-law have decided to ban me from seeing their children. I'm upset about it but I will move on. They took to social media and I'm now a clown with no love for family. They left out quite a few details and painted me as someone who doesn't understand what it means to be family because apparently you always help family no matter what. Apparently if she has a miscarriage I'm somehow responsible now. I've decided not to fight back. Anyone that knows my wife and I also knows how much we have helped. They are digging their own graves and I'm going to let them.

I tried speaking to my wife but she was upset so I decided to hand write a letter to her. I slipped it in her work bag as she was leaving for work. The letter was NOT an ultimatum. The contents of the letter outlined how much we have done in the last seven years with INCREASING frequency. She called me a few hours later and decided to take a half day off work to come home and talk to me. She walked through the door and gave me a hug and said she spoke with her sister. As of today we are 100% cutting them off from any type of help. This means no more money and more importantly... TIME. She cried and claimed it was one of the most difficult things she has done as it meant she had to accept her sister was taking advantage of her all this time. I told my wife lets just leave it as everyone is to blame. I'm sure if we had nipped it in the bud early on this would not have snowballed as much as it has. She felt much better with that explanation.
