1,"Am I The Asshole for Not Wanting to Take My Friend's Fall Pictures with his Girlfriend? So my friend, we'll call John, is 19. He is dating a girl who we'll call Becky is 16. As far as I know, them dating is okay. Whether or not, I refuse to take their photos. Here is why.

Firstly, she steals money from him and makes him spend all of his money on her. He doesn't have a job so most likely it is his parents money he is spending. Secondly, she is taking advantage of him by having him buy cigarettes for her because she legally can't. Third, she makes him babysit her toddler sister and baby niece everything they are together. Lastly, she is a jerk to him. She is always bitchy when they talk and won't let him be with his friends.

I'm not really one to do anything and I think he can do better. Am I the Asshole for Not taking their pictures because I cannot stand how she treats him?

Tldr: friend's girlfriend is a using jerk and I won't take their photos

EDIT: His parents have always told me to try and protect him. Like he has some IQ problems and is very impressionable. I feel it is my responsibility to help him.","Yes, if you haven't told him how you feel about the girl and explained to him why you don't want to take the pictures.

3,"AITA for wanting to be paid for emotional labor? Obligatory throwaway account for obvious reasons. And sorry, mobile so wonky formatting. 

So, a while back, I was asked to House/adult sibling-sit for my parents so that they could go out of town on vacation for a week. The sibling in question was having a tough time, and our parents didn’t feel comfortable leaving them alone to go on vacation, so unless I had agreed, they would have canceled it and stayed home. Granted, I would have agreed to do it for free, because I like to think I’m not an asshole, and they’re family. But they said that they would pay me, as well as leave me some grocery money, which I was much more comfortable with because it was a pretty big ask. It would be a whole week where I would live at their house, and basically only leave for work and to go to the grocery store, so that my sibling would have as little time left alone as possible. It’s not something that is particularly hard, just... really really emotionally draining. They also asked me to do a few small things around the house. So, I did. And when they came back, I sorta expected I’d get paid for the whole week. But when it came to talking about payment, they only asked me how many hours I’d spent doing the small things they’d asked. No mention of the week that I’d put my life off to watch my sibling. The small stuff had only taken maybe an hour, and I honestly would have felt more shitty to have been paid like $30 for that whole week than to not have been paid for any of it, so I told them not to worry about it. 

It’s not something I’m going to bring up because I love my family and tbh they’ve done some really nice things for me recently. But I can’t help feeling upset over being re-neged on. 

So, Reddit, Am I The Asshole for expecting payment for my emotional labor?","YTA. If you thought it was emotionally draining to help with your sibling *for one week* imagine how hard it must be on your parents. They needed a break and you stepped in to help. That's what families do. Life is a long road and you may need your family's help somewhere down the line, so be gracious about this and understand that good deeds are usually not paid gigs.",1,YTA,0.0,0.0,0
4,"AITA? I love to give people attention for no reason and then move on. I’ve always been a pretty touchy person, nothing sexual, but I love to hug people, hold their hand, poke them, heck I even give my friends messages (again not sexual) for fun. I definitely give people way more attention than they are willing to give me, doesn’t really bother me though. 

I’ve noticed however, that people take me and the attention I give them for granted, as if I’m somewhat disposable. I’m not socially inept in any way, so I can definitely tell people tend to think I’m lesser than them. These people aren’t bad people by any means and I’m sure if you ask them they don’t think of me as any less than themselves, but their actions definitely tell another story. For instance, they tend to think I can’t be serious about things or that I’m incapable of comprehending certain things. (This is definitely not the case, although I’m very private about my merit, I scored in the 1 percentile on the SAT and have maintained a very high GPA throughout college) I get it, I’m an extremely energetic person. 

So here’s the dilemma. I give people so much attention that they think of us as really close friends (or sometimes more than that), but in reality I don’t really care about them that much. I just like giving people attention and I don’t expect much back at all. When I move on, they get either really angry or really upset. They clearly have an emotional investment in me, I mean I’m always there to listen to their problems and give them solid advice. (Raised by a psychologist, she’s taught me a thing or two about helping people through tough times) During our friendship they always seem to see me as the disposable one, always down to hangout or do whatever, but when I’m ready to move on I feel like they’re being disposed of by me. 

Truthfully, I seldom invest into friendships emotionally. I’m quite a private person and I’m not sure these people are aware that I know *much* more about them than they know about me. Am I the asshole for giving them a false sense of friendship?",YTA.Also sounds like you are a narcissist.,1,YTA,0.0,0.0,0
10,"AITA for not inviting a friend on a group vacation A group of old college friends and I are going on a short vacation by the sea. We purposefully did not tell one of the group because - whilst they're a fine person and a good friend - they're a nightmare to live with. Without going into too much detail, they're very unhygenic and extremely arrogant. If they came, it would ruin it for everyone. We agreed not to tell them about the trip but we feel mean about it.

EDIT: We have discussed these issues with them before but they refuse to listen and it change anything","YTA...why have friends that you can't be honest with? Is that even friendship? 

Real friendship means being able to say to a mate that their hygiene is gross and their arrogance is offputting to others.

11,"AITA if I suggest selling my engagement ring that I never wear? I have been married to a wonderful man for over a decade. When we first started discussing marriage, I said up front I am not into jewelry and not to spend a lot on an engagement ring. I really only saw myself ever wearing a simple wedding band and a big rock on my finger just wasn't me. But for whatever reason, he still went for a nice ring with a beautiful, quality diamond. It is a beautiful ring, but I only wore it for the 6 months we were engaged, and then when we got married I only wore my wedding band after that. I just find it more practical, it doesn't have a diamond sticking up that can catch on things, and it is a less flashy ring, and just more ""me"" style-wise. I maybe pull my engagement ring out of the safe once a year if we go somewhere nice and get dressed up and even then it is only because my husband suggests I wear it.

Now this ring was given with love but I truly feel more sentimental about my wedding ring than the engagement ring. WIBTA if I suggested to my husband that this engagement ring (probably worth at least 5K) is wasted sitting in a safe 99% of the time and we could sell it and put the money towards something else (mortgage, car loan, family vacation, etc.)? We are not struggling financially, but I we are also pretty practical people who don't spend wastefully either. This ring might have been the biggest exception to that.



1. the value of the ring is not 5k. 5k is what we could probably get for selling it (well the diamond, really). The original price was way more.

2. The ring was bought on credit with a down payment by my husband, and I paid MORE than half of the ring off at the time when we combined finances.

3. The ring is not symbolic to my husband. He didnt want to look like a cheapskate (and wasnt sure I really meant it when I said to buy something cheap) so he spent way more than he should have. He is not upset that I never wear it. He never wears his ring either. He knows the wedding ring is the meaningful one to me. For our anniversary he had our kids birthstones set into it because I wear that one every day.",YTA. Maybe it doesn’t mean much to you but it means a lot to him.,1,YTA,,0.0,0
14,"WIBTA if I expose my fiance? My fiance loves talking politics, and is the type to get passionate and heated whenever a political discussion starts. He's very up to date on the issues and will often interject with factoids about things like law, tax policy, differences in jurisdictions, economics,  etc. Because of this, people tend to respect his opinion.

He's super liberal (as am I) and will often go on impassioned defenses of your standard fare liberal issues and earn ""You're such a great guy!"" comments from our friends and family for progressive views on women's rights and the like. On top of that, his mother considers him an expert on electoral politics and will seek out his opinion during election years.

Here is where I get really annoyed---

My fiance has never registered to vote.  He has never voted. He is well over 30. He has been hiding this from everyone in his family for well over a decade. As far as I know, I'm the only one that knows his secret. 

I've tried to get him to register a million times (we've gone to the movies and walked by easy register stations and he will refuse and say he will do it later). 

He constantly says he will register later, but never does. 

I constantly joke about exposing him, which freaks him out, but I'm actually kind of serious.

 I don't know if I can sit through another political rant about how conservatives are destroying the country without just blurting out *You're not even registered to vote!!!*

I don't have a really good reason for wanting to do this, other than my own irritation...

AITA if I do this???

EDIT--- let me just add, he knows he should register.  We laugh about it together. He also goes on rants about how Trump got elected because so many minorities and uneducated liberals don't vote. So he is not just holding out because he doesn't believe in voting. He is literally out there shaming others for not voting.","YTA if you do it confrontationally, but it wouldn’t be a bad idea to just interject it jokingly. Everyone needs to take voting seriously because that’s the only way you have a voice.  Next time he’s on a political conversation, bring it up as,” You’re right.

15,"AITA for disliking my mom as a person? Let me start this off by saying I'm a 25 year old male living at home with his parents and his older brother. My mom has always been a great parent - she's always the one who makes meals for us and does most of the chores at home. I would help around if she would ask, but she rarely does because she's a people pleaser at heart. In that regard, I love her as much as a son should love his mom. She would always put me first, but would treat me like I'm a 14 year old, which I'm getting really tired of. My mom also supports what life decisions I make, and she never really pressures me into pursuing significant careers (especially since I'm of Asian descent).  

&nbsp;

Here's where things get weird - my mom is a very judgmental person. She would often criticize other drivers for being terrible, even when they don't necessarily do anything bad. The worst part about this is that she herself doesn't have a driving license. She also can't take criticism well, *at all*. Whenever my dad jokes around, or says things about the meal being not flavourful enough, she would always get defensive and say ""You cook it then"". Even when my dad jokes about her taking too long to shop or whatever, she would never be able to laugh at herself.  


&nbsp;

The last, most recent thing that happened was today when my dad was helping my mom with her computer while she was cooking. My mom often likes watching dramas, and she had her internet browser open of the most recent episode she was watching. My dad closed the browser, and when she went back to her computer, she complained and moaned about how she forgot which episode she was on. She commented how if she didn't make dinner, this never would have happened. My dad is a very patient man, and he explained how she could just go to her internet history to find the episode, but she wouldn't listen at all. 

Overall, she's a negative person. She has happy moments, but whenever she complains, it just annoys me especially since the rest of my family never really complains about anything. Am I the asshole for disliking her? ","YTA, but only slightly. Your mom sounds kind of like a typical person, where they’re somewhat judgmental of other people and don’t like being criticized.  It’s not a set of great characteristics, but is pretty typically human. 

It seems silly to *dislike* your mother due to exhibiting somewhat obnoxious but typical human flaws. She’s a normal person. I think it would benefit you to realize she’s a flawed person and accept it for what it is. After all, you said she’s otherwise a great mom. Maybe you’ve gotten the idea in your head that she should be a perfect person because she’s a mother, and that’s generally not how it works. 

She’s a flawed human. And that’s okay. You probably have flaws, too.

22,"AITA for letting my dog bark at strangers? My partner and I recently moved into a not great house in a not the best neighborhood. Now this isn't like Florida not the best neighborhood but small city not the best. So no gun violence, and no stabbing. Just maybe random b and e. 
But even those happen rarely I would think. 
We do have a lot of homeless and a lot of drug addiction in the area. And outside of downtown our neighborhood has the highest police calls.
Because of this when ever our one dog barks at people in the front yard we don't discourage it. 
Now where I might be an asshole is my dog is truly a beast when she barks. She's a pittbul/Rottweiler mix and her hackles rise and she scares the shit out of people.
She's completely fenced in, there's no way she's getting out. She actually listens really well so when I call her she immediately stops and comes running back. And I always call her back when I see who she's barking at.
I've had random dudes all in black with their hoods up get the piss scared out of them and then start yelling and calling me an asshole.
I've also had her bark and scare the shit out of a Muslim mom and her kids. 
But she's also scared off this one guy that used to come to up to our house and look around... ask questions about our renos. He'd come around a couple times a month before we got the dogs. 

Additional info we've only had the dogs for three months. They are 7 and 10 a bonded pair. The younger one is the barker. I never leave the barker in the front yard alone. I always watch her and she doesn't really like to leave my side either way. I do try to dissuade her from barking at mom's and kids but it's hard for her to know the difference.

26,"WIBTA If I called out my mom and my sister when it comes to spending time with my daughter? Happy to give any additional info needed!


**Backstory:**  My daughter is now 7 years old. After kiddo was born and I went back to work, my mom watched her in the hours that overlapped my SO's and I's jobs. We eventually bought a house around the corner from my parents. My mom's continued to watch kiddo for 3 years. Until my mom got very ill and required surgery. During this time, mom said she was unable to watch her any longer. Sister took over watching kiddo in the overlap. Going into this arrangement, both mom and sister said they didn't need to be paid for this. **However**, I did give them money from my tax return every year and also any extra that I happened to be able to share. I also offered MANY times to put kiddo into daycare, there's a ""by income"" program in our state that would have made daycare affordable. After my sister took over, my mom would take kiddo out once a week for a few hours. Of course, kiddo grew VERY attached to her grandmother and aunt.

**Present**: Shortly after my daughter turned 3,I became fully disabled and unable to work. Over these past few years mom/sis basically ghosted kiddo. The only time they see/talk to kiddo is if I bring her around to them. My dad comes around and sees kiddo on his way home from work whenever he can. The only time mom/sis for sure see kiddo is holidays, which my mom is quick to post any and all pics of kiddo on FaceySpace to show off. 

**Here's what gets me** I've been present more than a few times when a family member or friend comments to my mother/sis how nice it is to have my kiddo right around the corner and they can see her whenever they want and how much time they must get to spend together...etc. When these conversations occur, mom/sis neglect to mention the fact that they go MONTHS without seeing or even talking to kiddo. They're more than happy to agree with whatever the person is saying though.


I'm fed up with it. Don't use my kid to make yourself look better. My kid has cried to me asking why her grandmother/aunt don't like her, why don't they come and see her, why they don't take her anywhere anymore, etc. I try and be as diplomatic as possible, explaining they both have health issues/are busy. Yes, they both have health issues, but neither one's issues are so bad that it would prevent them from seeing kiddo for months at a time. I have attempted to talk to mom/sis MULTIPLE times about spending time with kiddo, but my words fall on deaf ears.


**Would I be the asshole** if the next time someone comments to mom/sis how great it is that we live so close to them, I tell that person that mom/sister don't actually see/talk to kiddo for months at a time?


I have considered the fact that maybe kiddo is unpleasant to spend time with, but I really don't see that as being the case.I get compliments on her from people all the time about what a sweet kid she is and how well behaved she is, she really IS awesome! So I don't think that's it.

We have to do a project that consists of 2 parts. A formative one we have to do in groups, and a summative one which is individual. The formative one is to prepare you for the summative one, and as we hand it in we will receive feedback that we can use to do the summative one. 

Naturally, I want to do the best i can on the formative one, so I can get the most constructive feedback to create the best possible summative assignment I can. I was not allowed to choose my teammates.  I got paired with to women who are both not the strongest of the bunch in terms of grades and knowledge, but that is fine, we are there to learn.

TL:DR - got kicked out of my section at a hockey game yesterday by a power hungry usher for being “too loud and annoying”, security laughed at him and his manager chewed him out, tried to generate discussion in original thread but feeling some anger directed at me instead

I was directed to this sub by a commenter in the original post.

My questions:
1) I went to school in Philadelphia, so East Coast sports fans are “more passionate” or “assholes” depending on your view.  Does this play into how you should act at a sporting event?  I’ve never gotten yelled at before, why now?

2) I am naturally a loud person, despite having to act professional and be quieter in most environments, including work.  It is rare that I get to cheer overly loud for my team.  Should I just stay home from now on?

3) My wife tells me to tone it down all the time, but has never done so at a live game.  And I’m lucky she’s still with me, haha.  Is there a range of tolerance levels/“fandom” that I’m not aware of?

4) I had a mix of fans from both teams around me, including some friends.  As I stayed silent the 2nd period, I was making jokes and most of them chuckled.  Needed to add this info to provide some more context.

They’re not really passionate about anything and everything is just “good” or “bad”. They fight about nonsense, like whether or not they should pick the zucchini from the garden tonight or tomorrow. My mom, while she has good intentions, is worse. She doesn’t have a single hobby or thing that she does that she personally enjoys - she only takes pride in making sure that everyone in our family is ok. Which, while noble - is extremely suffocating to me personally (which I have said many times) and mentally unhealthy for her personally. She used to draw, hike, do things. While I understand you make sacrifices as a parent, you don’t sacrifice your ENTIRE identity. So she is always asking “hey did you get your parking pass for school?” “hey did you get new clothes?” “hey did you go to the doctor?” ... which look, I get it. She is my mom, and she cares. The problem is that is the only dialogue we have. There is no substance other than a string of anxiety inducing questions about my life. I know what I have to do, I know what I have on deck, I’m getting a bit older now. Having someone at your back reminding you of every little thing going on in your head is really taxing, mentally. Recently, I’ve learned about Myers Briggs, and I have heard that one of the worst parent-child relationships is having two sensing parents with one intuitive child. My sister is also a sensor, and I have always felt deeply misunderstood by all of them. I love them all, but I genuinely am unhappy to spend time with them.

39,"AITA For arguing that I should be dropped off at school like normal instead of walking? I am a high school student, and my dad drops me off at school every day, along with my brother. His classes start at 7:30, so we leave at 7:10 to make sure that he gets to school in time, as we have to drop me off first (I would be late if he were dropped off first). If I don't get into the car at 7:10, I will get dropped off in a shopping center close to my school instead of the road next to it, so my brother will still be on time. We have another rule where if someone else is late instead of me (usually it's my fault we are late) I will get dropped off near the school like normal.

&#x200B;

Today, my brother and I got into the car at the same time (7:11), but my dad still said I had to walk. I made the argument that since my brother and I got into the car at the same time we were technically both late, but my dad wouldn't hear any of it. He said that I needed to take responsibility for my actions and my brother was already ready at the time, he just was waiting on my dad and I (my dad started the car around 7:10, and my brother quickly followed; he was getting into the car as I was walking towards it and we shut the doors maybe 5 seconds apart).

&#x200B;

It ended up getting into a big argument with my dad, and later my mom, who admitted that the rules were ambiguous but said I needed to take responsibility for my actions (which I feel I did, but according to her ""I was late, but we closed the door at the same time so we were both late"" is not being responsible).

She'll regularly download viruses and malware thinking they're PC ports of shitty mobile games she heard of online. Until recently, her and I had to share a computer. Countless times she's nearly ruined the PC we shared. She even caused me to lose all my Minecraft save data. Every time I tell her not to trust any old .exe file she finds online, she yells at me. ""iT'S nOt mY fAuLt tHaT i'M nOt a cOmPuTeR-oBsEsSeD wEiRdO!"".

42,"WIBTA for making a return? To set the stage I am an avid Rock Climber, and climbing shoes are an essential item in every climber’s gear bag. 

I recently purchased a pair of shoes from a friend at a huge discount. The shoes were brand new, albeit too small for him. I decided I would try and make them fit and bought them from him for $50, but after wearing them for a day I discovered they are a half size too small for me. I asked if he would take them back, but he said no. I called the company that makes the shoes and told them that they were still in “like new” condition but that I did not have the original box. The company basically said tough luck and left it at that. 

Now there is an outdoor equipment company that has an incredibly open return policy that I have purchased shoes from before. Their policy is “if it’s within the first year it was purchased then the item can be returned or exchanged with no questions asked” and any returned items are then sold in a Garage Sale style event each quarter. 

My thought process is if I purchase the same shoes in the proper size then return the pair that doesn’t fit would that make me an asshole? The shoes have only ever been worn twice, once by the original owner and once by me, and would be bought by someone else that could use them at the Garage Sale event, and I would have a pair of shoes that fit. 

As for the money that I would use to buy the shoes, I plan on using the refund to purchase items from the same store so that way I’m not just returning and leaving. My question is would that make me an asshole? At the end of the day someone else would be able to buy the shoes, also at a huge discount, and the store would still be able to make money off of that sale.

Last night I was awoken by her drunk calling me at 2am asking me to pick her up. I asked her where she was and she was a 30minute drive away at least, so 1hr there and back. I just told her to stay with one of her friends and hung up, went back to sleep.

45,"AITA for calling a player for perceived cheating? What started out as a case of friendly fire in a game of D&D 5e resulted in myself getting expulsed from the party. 

During one of our sessions, I had set myself to fire open a target with lightning bolt (a straight line AOE spell). Before my turn had come, another player stepped into my line of fire. When my turn came up, I found I could not reposition and still cast my spell, so I quickly ran some numbers and saw that I wouldn't be able to deal enough damage to the other player to incapacitate him, so I went through with my attack. 

After this, the player was (rightfully) upset, but the situation was able to be dealt with during the session. However, another player (fearing future friendly fire) requested a duel between the two characters. During the duel, I caught the player adding modifiers to attacks incorrectly and using abilities that they could not during their turn. The player always said that they did this by mistake, but said I was being rude and a rules lawyer for calling them out. 

The end result was that the player lost the duel and was offended that I looked over their sheet for anymore signs of cheating.

51,"AITA for requesting my new roommates pay higher rent than us? I don't live in the USA, and I hid the actual numbers for privacy reasons.

backstory: we are foreigners who don't live in our home country. Brother and I used to live with our parents. We decided to move out because we were getting emotionally abused. Our situation wasn't the best, but we managed to find a place after a while, and we lived semi frugally pay check to pay check to be able to afford living by ourselves. Brother had furniture and we set the whole place up with all the needed appliances (Fridge, couches, TV, microwave...etc. All high end if that matters).

Some months later I got a 25% raise, so I wanted to help my friend (Let's call him L) from my home country to come to the country I live in and find work. I paid for his visa, ticket and all expenses until he got up on his feet so he'd live with us and help with the rent and all. We expected L to find a job that pays around 75% of my salary (Expected salary for new graduates) but by a stroke of good luck he found a job that almost doubles my salary.

After he got the job, we agreed that L and I would pay around 40% of the rent each, and my brother would pay around 20%. I calculated and kind of decided everything as L and my brother don't like to discuss money matters and they weren't very familiar with each other. I kind of made that choice because I didn't want to cause issues, and because the furniture is brother's so it makes sense for him to pay less.

Now, L wants to help our other friend (Let's call him H) the same way. We were discussing how the rent distribution is gonna be, and they wanna split it evenly between the 4 of us. I gave it some more thought and I think it's unfair that we'd split the rent evenly between the 4 of us, when my brother and I were the ones that got the deal on the place, set it all up with furniture and appliances, and if not for my help he wouldn't have found a job or be able to help our other friend (I know it's an asshole thought, but I wanna be honest. Thought does come up often on my mind).

Right now, I think that L and H paying 33% of rent each is fair. It even got me to rethink the original arrangement 3 of us had, and I think L paying around 50% of rent, instead of both of us paying the same amount, is fair too, all things considered. I deduced these prices by comparing our living space with similar ones in our city, and I don't think they will find any better offers, especially considering the readily available furniture and appliances. Excluding the peace of mind as our living space is a section of a villa, and not a room inside an apartment like most other living spaces are (We don't share same kitchen/Bathroom with other residents as apartment roommates would, and we have our own entrance). I should mention they can afford these rents with no issues, I used to pay more than the amount I suggest with less salary.

56,"AITA for cancelling my Uber because he was vaping I'm 15, and I had to order an Uber but my phone wasn't working. My dad ordered the Uber for me. When he got there, I clearly saw that he was vaping a *lot.* It was an actual vape, not a Juul. He had been waiting outside for maybe ten+ minutes. I told him that I was probably the wrong person and went back inside. My dad yelled at me because clearly he would stop vaping when I went in the car, and vaping is probably odorless anyways, plus I'd made him wait for twenty minutes (it was actually around ten). Still, I ended up taking a different Uber. AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit: (My conclusion as of 10:56 ET):

**\*ITA for telling him that it was the wrong person \[caused confusion for Uber driver/wasted his time + money\].** I then walked away and called my dad, and my dad told me that ""it was the right Uber, X is my name on Uber"" .... meaning that the man had proceeded to call my dad after I left. I think that there are white lies that are equally effective in this situation - ie, sorry, it *is* me but my friend/family member is picking me up, or something of that nature.

**\*ITAish - should've waited to tell my dad to call the Uber/made it more clear that I wasn't ready \[would've prevented him from waiting\]**. (I texted him: ""I'm at the carousel waiting for luggage, can you wait 5-10 min and call an uber because my Uber isn't working"" at about 6:00, at 6:08 he texted me that the Uber had arrived, and then at 6:12 I asked him where.) My phone died sometime in between, and I probably got to the driver roughly at 6:18. I should've given myself a larger window for this.

**\*ITA for making assumptions about his sketchiness \[he is probably not going to hurt me or anything, which I mostly recognized at the time\].** Had I scheduled the Uber for myself and seen his ratings, I may have felt more comfortable. That is not a good thing imo.

**\*NTA for being uncomfortable \[I do maintain that it is unprofessional to vape ""on the job"", but it's debatable whether or not he was on the job at the moment\]**. I do think that I reserve the right to feel uncomfortable in situations and to exercise my own instinct. I think the ethicality of these situations is determined by my responses, not reactions.

We never dated each other since we would rather be best friends for life. We dated other people in high school and that never impacted our friendship. When we were 22 and single, we thought it would be fun to make a pact that if we were both not married by 32, we would get married to each other.

We talked about this pact often until she got married when she was 28, had a kid and got divorced two and a half years later. I have had several short-term relationships.

She says it triggers her PTSD which is understandable, so I apologized and said I would try to avoid throwing or tossing harmless objects at her.

Apparently this offense stressed her so badly that she ended up crying over it and was incredibly afraid and belittled because I chuckled at her flinching and anger towards me for tossing the x-acto blade handle at her.

She still lives at home and has no job besides selling decorations on etsi.
My husband often is on business trips so I take care of my daughters (f 18 and f 14) all alone.

So yesterday my daughter was running arround the block when her cellphone rang and it was her sister, so I just took the call and talked to my other daughter. When I hang up I notice that the home screen has the tinder app. I was honestly shocked because I had never allowed my daughter to used dating apps as they are very dangerous. I had read so many articles that young girls ended up abused and worse by their tinder dates, that I had made a point of educating my daughters and telling them that you only find your real love trough real life.

So I opened her profile and was horrified. She had some explicit photos of her on her profile. I mean in bikini and stuff and her quote on her profile was "" I solemnly swear I am up to no good"". I never thought my daughter would be like that. And I was even more disgusted by the guys she was talking to. The youngest was a 22 y.o mechanic. And she even set up a date with him!

I took her phone, deleted the app and waited for her to come home.
Once she was I confronted her and told her that it was unlike her to have such an app and that I foebidd her from seeing the guy because she never knew what his intentions were.
She told me that he was a sweet guy and she was safe. That she would share her location with a friend and only meet him in public.
I told her it was not acceptable and that I knew that tinder was an app for casual sex and I would never let her do that because sex is something Intimate that she could not give away to everyone.

We got in a heated debate and I told her that until she learned her lesson I would take her phone.

She looked very mad and left. I don't care because she will see that I did it because it was the best for her.

72,"AITA for saying I’m a graduate student I am a resident physician and also a PhD candidate. My wife is a full time graduate student.

Last night we were at a social function where we wanted to make a good impression and we met someone new. Our new acquaintance asked what I did for a living, and I said I was an OBGYN. She then turned to my wife and asked what she did, my wife replied she was a PhD student. 

This I why I might be an asshole, because I kinda butted in and said “oh yeah, I’m actually a PhD student also”. It had just occurred to me.

When we got home my wife asked why I always feel the need to mention that I’m a PhD student too. That isn’t it enough that I’m a doctor. I can understand why in this case I might have been rude because I kinda butted in, but all the times I’ve mentioned it in the past I normally remember to do so at the beginning “I’m a OBGYN and a PhD student” but I forgot this time. Her mentioning it reminded me! 

She seems to think I shouldn’t mention it at all to allow her to shine. She pointed out that people tend to ask me before her and so it makes her feel silly replying “just a PhD student” after I’ve given out my response. But I don’t see why I should keep my accomplishments hidden. After all we are a team and 2 PhDs are better than one!

75,"AITA for laughing at my missing childhood acquaintance? So bit of background information:
I'm in a group chat with everyone of my lower school class' members. Really fun, and really nice to still be in contact with them. However, there's 1 guy who isn't in the group chat. I heard he's a junkie now, and somewhat on the criminal path. Nobody has heard of him for years.

So, an hour ago, my local police put out a message on their twitter that this particular guy was missing, and there's a search team actively looking for him (including a photo of his face). Someone in the group chat made a screenshot of the tweet. The tweet stated that this guy was missing and said he was last seen wearing a black coat, brown pants and white crocs.

When reading this, I kinda had to laugh because of the white crocs. This was also my response to the screenshot sent into the group chat:

'Wow, What?!'
'Kinda had to laugh because of the white crocs tho'
'But damn'

Now everyone in the group chat is saying I'm insensitive and there's a guy missing, and god knows what happened to him

76,"WIBTA if I make a pub adapt their business routine to me? Just to give you some background.
Me: I moved in London to finish my studies, last year of medicine. I come from a very small town of a very small country, and I realize that I was one of those “sheltered kid” my entire life. Never had to rent an apartment by myself.

Background: months ago I rent a room next with a family. That went south quickly as the police came and threw every single one of us out (reason I can’t disclose). Instead of sleeping in the street I put myself on the lookout for an apartment ready to rent, and I found this sweet deal for a 1 bedroom apartment. I took it.

The problem is that I didn’t scout the area around, and this apartment faces a pub. This pub plays loud music every single night. Some nights, when they do karaoke, I can hear the people singing down to the lyrics, from my study room.

They do this every night until 1 am, and some nights until 3 am. 

I have contacted the environmental health department of competence, and to their credit, they did intervene and requested the pub to lower the music down to a certain level. What they do now it’s totally random, sometimes the music is really high some nights is low. When I contacted back the department, they told me that that’s all they could do, unless I was willing to take it to court and all, which is costly.

So I decided to post on reddit, here on AITA and on legaladviceuk. I’ve been called asshole both time for not scouting the area and pretending that a business would adapt to my needs. 

As of today, I basically adapted my study routine around them. I stay in the library from 3pm to basically 1am or 2 am. Not ideal at all since I don’t like altering my routine.

Now the situation is this. I’ve been lucky enough to meet through tinder a lady who works for a solicitor firm. She told me that I could record the noise and she gave me some regulation to follow so that those recording would be considered proof enough from their solicitor firm to take my case. She told me that, as the firm likes easy wins, they would price me for discount (40% of what I would normally pay) and that she was ready to speed up the case for me.

So I did all that, and in less than a week they prepared a “cease and desist” form to be sent to the pub.

They called the solicitor firm saying that it is so unfair as they are there from before the apartments were built and that they are a pub targeted at a very particular minority group, so that could be considered harassment on my end. Also, they tried to reduce the volume before, but they had way less customers in that case and they were about to fail, so reducing the volume for them is a no go.  The solicitor firm replied with a long letter stating my rights and what would happen if they don’t comply. Since that letter was sent, I am hearing very very little noise. Now the question is, am I the asshole in this scenario? Am I ruining a business because of my selfishness?

84,"AITA for using the word faggot in reference to somebody I was having a confrontation with? Long story short, I was at a party two days.  It was fun, and a good number of people were getting tipsy, I wasn't one of them.  Basically I was having a good time just talking to others then this other party member, lets call him Barry, comes up to me.  So sidenote Barry is kinda an asshole himself and is extremely machismo, aggressive, and just overall a dick.  We were never really fond of each other and kinda keep our distance at social gatherings as our friends were all friends with each other, so I saw him often.

&#x200B;

But he was drunk and starts talking to me, friendly for about 4 sentences before he starts backhand roasting me in front of some of the girls we were talking to.  (This is college party btw, he was talking dumb shit like my shoes and hair, etc high school kind of shit).  I pretty quickly realized he was trying to act tough to me, being 6'4'' and male to impress others, and it seems like he wanted to try to fight.    Pretty soon we were arguing very loudly, my voice is deep and tends to travel, and he called me a bitch and alittle punk and a pansy in the midst, I returned insults of similar nature.  I wasn't trying to fight, I knew his game, but one of the insults I told him without really thinking was something along the lines of ""Coming up to me thinking your tough and acting like a faggot makes is really fucking sad man""  Now the verbal argument continued for like 30 seconds before we were seperated and the rest of the night went on kinda unsmooth.

&#x200B;

Thats all the really important details, I left some gaps for the sake of making this story short, but basically I got a text from one of the girls who overheard at the party and called me a homophobic dick for calling Barry a faggot.  I didnt response since i didnt really care but the incident has got me thinking.  Now I know this guy isn't gay and I didnt mean any offense but i wanted to just say he was being a cunt in another wording.  I never really saw myself as homophobic.

In late 2018, SIL lost her baby at 34 weeks. She was really devastated. After this, she started acting weird.She'd ask to see my son a lot and offer to babysit etc which wasn't weird by itself but then she started treating him like he was much younger. Baby talking to him, trying to swaddle him etc. It made me super uncomfortable (it was like she was close to being delusional) and my husband and I stopped letting her see him. At first I'd just make excuses and say my son had xyz things to do but then eventually just told her husband I didn't feel comfortable with him being around her. At the time everyone in the family  (including her husband) supported me in this. She'd call and say things like she missed her baby (referring to my son) but I'd just say make some excuse.Her behaviour got even weirder for a while, she started treating her cat like a baby (putting the cat in a pram and walking around etc) and I just essentially cut her off. My husband stayed in touch with her and her husband.

Over Christmas she called me asking me to let her please see my son and that she missed her nephew. She apologised if she made me uncomfortable before and claimed that she's better now and that she'd been having therapy all year. I wasn't so convinced (she was in therapy even when she was behaving weird so Idk how effective it was. I saw her over Christmas and she seemed normal but she seemed fine before even). I refused saying that I was still uncomfortable. She started begging and saying she really missed her nephew etc but eventually said she understood. But then she must've also asked my husband cause he was trying to convince me to let her see him and saying that he wants it to be a joint decision but he might just let his sister see him cause ""he's my son too"".

88,"AITA for getting upset at my sister for getting me a toy for my birthday, then getting rid of it a few years later? So this happened roughly three years ago. My sister lives in Oregon and I live in California. My birthday is in December, and my family knows I have a very negative experience with birthdays because its a roughly a week before Christmas, and so with factors like weather, finances, work, etc, I rarely do anything for them, ask for anything, or really care about mine. 

My main views on gift giving are that you should get someone things they actually would want/need and not things you believe they would like. My family knows this is how I operate and I tell them this when they ask what I want for my Birthday/Christmas. A few days after my birthday, my sister came down to spend the holidays with us. We went to dinner as a family and there she gave me a gift: a large Link from Legend of Zelda toy. I thanked her for the gift, but I was a bit upset at this. The main reason was that, while I like video games, I don't at all need something like this and have nowhere to put it. It was a fairly big toy, so it couldn't be put out to display, and so it would simply sit in the closest.

After dinner, we went back to my mom’s house and I told my mother in private I did not appreciate the gift since I thought it was a bit silly for someone nearly 30 years old to give their 25 year old brother a toy made for kids. I should add that she did not mean this as a joke gift either, she was very happy about it and was acting like it was something I had been asking for. I told my mom I was happy to see her, but that I would have she simply get me a card since I have told them not to worry about getting my stuff usually. My mom got very upset at this and said I was being rude to her, and ungrateful as she thought it was a nice gift. We argued a bit and I left early, telling her I did not like being treated like a kid by both of them and that I would have rather she gotten me nothing instead. The next time I saw them, I apologized for my behavior since while I was still annoyed with it, I knew I had made it a bigger deal then it was.

Well, that takes us to this year. I finally was able to move out of my father’s house and into a place I could afford. As I was cleaning my room out, I found the Link toy and gave it away to Goodwill so someone else could have it. I mentioned this to my mom recently, and she told me that it was rude of me to do so and that I had not been nice about that whole situation.

So, am I the asshole? Also apologies for any grammar mistakes.

89,"AITA for wanting a coworker to take personal leave until they can concentrate on work? About six months ago I began noticing that something wasn't quite right with a coworker (Miriam). She is in a different department but my team works with her on some projects. Issues ranged from emails written so oddly that intentions were unclear to ignoring/violating corporate compliance. Shortly after I noticed the trend, another coworker mentioned similar issues they had with Miriam.

Over the next few months, things got worse. Many times Miriam sent comments or direction either very vague or simply incorrect. In these instances, I would reply for clarifications: ""Can I get a few more details?"", ""Are you sure about this?"", ""How does that jibe with this other thing that would contradict it?"", ""Is this a new process?"", etc. Sometimes I'd get a response that made sense. Sometimes I just used my best judgment to move forward. Miriam didn't seem to notice either way.

My coworker has a good relationship with Miriam's supervisors (and I do not have a good relationship with those people) and had mentioned to them some of the smaller issues. The response was that Miriam is dealing with a family issue and to cut her some slack.

Many projects that generally run smoothly had problems this year. As 2018 winds down, there have been talks about why certain projects were bogged down. Until last week, I'd only had private conversations with a couple people about Miriam being at the center of it.

One day, in a lesson she was absent at, i heard a boy from our class say something along the lines of ""Miri should shave that unibrow, it's ugly as hell."" I of course got mad but i didn't want to get in a fight so i didn't say anything. I was boiling the whole lesson. 

After Miri came back, i told her: ""i don't care if it's gonna hurt you, i need to tell you this."" And i proceeded to tell her about that boy's comment.

She didn't talk that much to me that day and told me that we should go separate ways to our houses, instead of going together.

92,"AITA for not agreeing to give our future child my girlfriend's surname? So we're coming up to 4 years in our relationship, and we've been having talks about having children in a relatively distant future. After marriage, she plans on keeping her last name, which I have no issues with whatsoever, it's her name so it's her choice. However, when it comes to what the children's last name would be, she didn't hesitate to say that they should be her surname, no questions asked, because of the following reasons:

1. Her paternal grandfather had 5 girls and 1 boy, and that boy is my girlfriend's father now, so he was the only one that had the surname passed down, while the rest of them had their name changed from marriage. She feels bad that her dad can't pass on his name and that his surname lineage will die out with his kids, and so she wants to do it in honor of her father.
2. She is not looking forward to the whole pregnancy and birthing process, from insemination to post-birth recovery, whether it's vaginal or C-section. She has read a lot of articles and watched a lot of videos on all the possible risks that could happen and the damage it could do to her, both physically and mentally. The fact that she has to carry a baby for 9 months and have her body permanently scarred from giving birth, while her spouse remains unscathed and healthy without a care in the world, makes her think that she has the RIGHT to have the final say on the FULL NAME, first middle and last, without my having any say in the matter.

Here are the reasons why I think the above are not valid arguments:

&#x200B;

1. My father never had a father, so he's actually the first in a line of my family's last names to be passed down to another generation.  In my opinion, both my father and my girlfriend's father are practically in the same boat here, so I don't think the first reason is applicable in this situation.
2. I can understand where she's coming from, and I feel bad for any partner I'm with to go through the child birth process, which is why I want to be there for her in every waking moment to provide the best comfort throughout her pregnancy stages and be able to nurture our child after birth for as long as she needs to recover! What she said, however, makes me feel like the effort I'm putting in doesn't even come close to what she has to go through, and makes me feel like I'm not involved with the family, like my opinion doesn't matter and my worth in the family is insignificant compared to what she'll be going through.

So that's the situation....also, she added that if we were to adopt a child, she would CONSIDER allowing the child to have my last name and be open to discussion about it...I would be happy enough to just have our kids have a combination (not hyphenated) of our surnames, but she doesn't like the sound of it. The fact that I have to negotiate this with my partner is something I would have never expected to do, and I don't see how her reasons are fair to me.","YTA

There’s no reason the child should have your last name above hers, but she’s right that creating a child is far more work on the woman’s side than the mans, so that seems a reasonable argument she’s making there. Your emotions about being less involved are something you need to work through before you have the child, and won’t be solved through a name.",1,YTA,0.0,0.0,0

I have a very tight budget which I am very strict about for good reason. I'm cheap so I don't spend money a lot but my friends were in town and I couldn't pass up hanging out with them but when I do, it can get expensive. To make sure I don't go over budget, I withdraw some cash as my budget and use that.

Well on day one, I was hanging out with one friend when she decided we should get lunch at this fast food place that isn't too cheap. I bring a 20 with me and we pay separate. I go second and food comes to 6 dollars, I give the 20 and get 7 back in change. I notice this but cashier has already walked off and is ignoring us. This is after a very long wait even though we are the only ones there. Later we get our food but she just drips it off and leaves before I can talk to her, she's no where in sight and she also got my order wrong. 

Fast forward to the day after the next and these two friends I haven't seen in a while want to go for massages which was pre planned, at this point I forgot about the fast food thing so I grab the cash I have since we pre planned this and I made sure there would be just enough to go woth just a few dollars extra.

She's smart, she's funny, and she's got the greatest heart I've ever seen in a human. She loves the bully and the victim. She doesn't lack in confidence or male/female attention, and right now she has a male companion. I'm her 15 year old younger brother. If I'm allowed to exercise my ego for a moment I don't believe I'm bad-looking and I've got many friends, I have success in many areas of sport and study, and I have a steady girlfriend who I adore. In short, I'm not jealous of my sister.

Our house has a kind of weird layout and means my sister has the third floor bedroom, plenty of privacy, however there's a half floor landing between the second and third floor that houses her and mine shared bathroom that looks into my sister's bedroom, however because of the angle you can't really see the person the bathroom landing. A few months ago I went up for a midnight pee and her bedroom door was open and she was awake. I typically glance inside to check on her and on this night I saw her laying on her bed making out with her teddy bear. She's had this bear since she was three and she routinely patches his increasingly multiple age spots and has a pathological fear of getting rid of him.

She's possessive of him and our mom likes to tease her cruel and hide the bear and tell her she threw it away. My sister always gets incredibly upset and cries, leading me to take the bear from mom and give it back. I've asked mom to stop hiding the damn bear multiple times but she thinks it's funny and harmless, constantly asking my sister what's gonna happen when she goes to college next fall and has a roommate who makes fun of her for having a teddy bear at 18.

Anyway, I've gone up to use the bathroom at various points during the day and night over the last few months and I've seen her kissing her teddy bear several times. It's really starting to concern me. She has a boyfriend, one might think she'd rather kiss him. I don't think this is weird or degenerate but I'm worried about her, I don't know what this means.

Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.

We had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be ""losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.""

My sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.

...except, she wasn't accepted. 

My sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:

> Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.

> During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both ""recently applied"" and other who had been ""accepted"" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.

My entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset.

It’s so hurtful, my moms always crying and while my sister and I are hurt, we’re mostly angry. Here’s the final straw, they’re having a baby soon. (I can’t have children if my own & my relationships with my nieces & nephews means the world to me. I treat them amazing & love spending time with them). L recently sent a text stating none of us will be allowed to see the baby until we get 2 vaccines that cost about $300 per person (which I’m actually ok with, I don’t want to do anything to hurt my nephew). Buy my sister has an autistic toddler who isn’t due for these shots yet so she can’t see the baby at all. We’re also not allowed to hug or kiss the baby, we may hold the baby shortly but only if I wear fresh laundered clothing & have taken a fresh shower (bc I’m an occasional smoker), also the baby is never allowed at my house (I don’t understand why, I don’t smoke in my house) There were many other stipulations included and I agree some are reasonable but are basic common sense. Our family feels like this list of demands is really her way of making it near impossible for any of us to be around the baby & unable to bond with him. I’m Devastated but I’m not willing to jump threw L’s constantly changing hoops just to see the baby. AITA for not wanting to follow these ridiculously crazy rules, even if that means not seeing my nephew?","YTA. These aren’t crazy rules. These are very normal precautions for handling a baby. Kissing a baby can transmit herpes virus which can be fatal to newborns. Don’t get me started on vaccines. I’d love to know what vaccines she wants you all to get and why the fact your sister’s toddler is autistic has anything to do with getting vaccines. If the flu shot is one that your SIL wants you all to have, children over the age of 6 months can receive the flu shot so that shouldn’t be an an issue. I also understand her aversion to thirdhand smoke on your clothes or body. Yeah this lady sounds like she’s been an ass in the past, but you can’t call her “crazy” for wanting to protect her new baby.",1,YTA,0.0,0.0,0
108,"AITA for wanting to choose my own grandmother name? My oldest step daughter is having my first grand child in a few weeks. We don’t have a perfect history but we’ve gotten pretty close as she’s gotten older. I have never treated his girls as anything other than my daughters. I honestly thought we were fine. 
She has a bunch of cousins that gave her tons of baby stuff and she has just asked for diapers and wipes from my family. Of course my sister and I want to get her all kinds of gifts, but we kid her about it. I wanted to give her a shower, but she wasn’t really interested in anything but a luncheon, so we said we’d do that and ask everyone to help put together her baby book in lieu of gifts. I keep mentioning that she’s likely to have the baby early because of her contractions, having a small torso and a very large baby, etc, but it’s mostly in fun.
So recently my husband and I have been talking about our grandparent names. I wanted to go with Emmy and he just wasn’t happy with super traditional ones, but didn’t know what he wanted otherwise. Stepdaughter is putting her foot down that she would NOT call me that and that she wants to call us Grandpa and my first name. When they were little their mom insisted I be called by my name even when stepdad was called dad. It hurt me to my core to think she wouldn’t allow me to have a grandparent name. Then she suggested MiMi and when I said I didn’t like it, she complained that I was steamrolling her on EVERYTHING about the baby including how to raise it?!? 
I feel like she’s being incredibly ungrateful, especially since she is now angry and calling off the luncheon we had planned for her. 
I don’t really want to compromise on this but I don’t know what to do. I realize she’s probably hormonal and overwhelmed, but this seems like something that barely affects her but means a lot to me.","YTA - Sorry Emmy, but you sound like A Lot and I'm going to side with your stepdaughter on this one. I say this as someone who is also A Lot: You've gotta tone it allll the way down. You're not meaning to steamroll, but you're steamrolling nonetheless.

And miss me with the ungrateful stuff. You seem focused on you and you alone. What YOU wanted to do for her, what YOU want to be called. What YOU think her birth experience will be like (with bonus unsolicited body commentary which...yikes). You even refer to HER child not as her first child, but as YOUR first grandchild. You're gonna have to rein it in and --I feel like I shouldn't have to say this-- let your stepdaughter think about herself and her baby, not her overbearing stepmother.

Sort yourself out, or the only thing your first grandbaby is going to call you is ""that lady we never see.""",1,YTA,0.0,0.0,0
109,"AITA for being mad at my roommate for sleeping with my brother? I have been living in an apartment with three women since April. At the outset I promised myself that I would get romantically involved with or sleep with any of them so as to not make the living situation awkward or complicated. A few months in, once I got to know them better, I began to get very close to one of them. Everything about her behavior seemed flirtatious: long, warm hugs, her willingness to be open and share, her desire to talk about sex, how she smiled, looked at and touched me. It all seemed like flirting which, against my better judgment, I fell for. 

I began to get attached to her emotionally and we started doing more things together. I thought for sure this would at least lead to sex, if not a relationship. I took it slowly. I wanted to make the right moves at the right time. Then my older came to stay for two nights. 

I know my brother. I honestly was very reluctant to let him stay with me because I was afraid he would sleep with my roommate. But he’s my brother, so what am I to do?  Surely he has respect for my place and my boundaries. I worked from 3 to 11 both nights of his stay, so I left keys for him to get into my apartment. I figured we could hang out after I got free. 

I came home and waited until 1:30am for him. I thought he might be out with my roommate, but I figured they would send me an invite. It never came. Just as I was about to go to bed I heard a door open, so I went to investigate. My roommates door was ajar and both had exited. 

I didn’t want to believe it. The next morning I asked him directly if he had slept with her. He said no. I was so desperate to believe him I left it at that and told him how I felt about her. We had a late lunch then I left for work. He went back to my apartment. 

I couldn’t escape the thought that he had lied to me, so a few days after he left I asked my roommate, while we were cuddling, if she had slept with him. She said “of course not”.  

For a month my roommate and I got closer. We cuddled, talked intimately, occasionally did some heavy petting, but she wouldn’t sleep with me and wouldn’t say why. But her flirting continued. I would tell my brother my frustrations and joys about her until finally, at the end of the month, he came clean and told me the truth.  They did sleep together. Both nights. 

I can maybe understand the first night: he didn’t know how I felt. But I told him the second day and he did it again anyway that night. And as for her, she claims she never intentionally flirted with me; that’s just “how she is”.  They both lied to me for a month and I feel deeply hurt and betrayed by both of them and my trust in my brother is shattered.  What’s worse is that I really wanted my roommate to like me more than a friend. She never did. Yet in two nights she fell in love with my brother. And that honestly feels like I was robbed of something.  I later got the chance to read their text history. It was as flirty as you can imagine. They had every intention of meeting again. And they frequently called each other. She had never called me once. 

Am I the asshole here? I get I am in a way punishing them for my delusion: my roommate and I were never anything but roommates, but she really lead me on and I feel fostered my emotional attachment to her.  Is my anger and heartache justified, or am I being crazy?

110,"AITA for taking pictures of my kids playing at their playgroups? So I have 2 kids, a son that is almost 2 and a daughter that is 6 months, because of this we tend to go to a lot of activities to get out of the house and so the kids can burn off some steam before nap time. I like to take pictures while we’re there because my son’s father and I aren’t together so he likes when I can send pictures of our son playing and doing stuff; I also take pics for my boyfriend as he works away so he also likes to have me send him pics of what me and the kids do. 

Anyways I was at playgroup one day and I was taking pictures of my son playing when a mom approached me and told me I wasn’t allowed to post the pictures I had just taken on to social media because one of her kids happened to be in the background. 

I’m sorry, but we are in a public space and I’m just trying to take pictures of my kids to send to their dads and maybe post 1 or 2 on Facebook for my other family and friends to see. Also there are no rules in this group saying that I can’t take pictures, especially if my own kids!

112,"WIBTA for cutting off a long time friend for his benzodiazepine addiction? A friend of mine from high school is without question, addicted to benzodiazepines (Ativan, Xanax, Klonopin, Valium). Hes currently prescribed a very high dose of Klonopin for his anxiety, OCD, ADHD, and has been on it for at least 5 years

We kind of grew distant in the past year or so, but he reached out to me a few months ago. We agreed to hang out, and had a nice conversation about life and recovery (I'm an ex heroin addict and have been clean for over a year). He told me about his problems about his wife separating from him, problems with his family etc. I left feeling pretty hopeful we had a meaningful conversation, and had alot in common. We were in agreement he needs to get off the benzos and he said he was going to make a sincere effort to get off them and better his life.

I'm currently prescribed a low dose of klonopin ( which I havent taken in over 6 months, I just like knowing I have them if I ever need them). He found out about it and hes been messaging me every few weeks to try and buy them. He says hes in withdrawal and theres always some excuse to why he needs more. I know the withdrawal can be hell, so I caved in and would come through every month (for the past 4 months) to give him my bottle.

I know addiction is hell, and I honestly do feel bad for him, and I like him as a person. But I cant shake the feeling hes really not making an effort to better his life. He always flatters me with complements and jokes, and tells me how I'm such a good friend and really helping him out when I see him. I want to believe it, but part of me feels like all he really gives a shit about is the pills. Hes called and texted me about 10 times today from private numbers, saying stuff like ""did I do something wrong:(?"" Because I didnt text him when I got them refilled this month.

I've been ignoring his calls for 2 days now, he sounds really desperate for pills, and I cant tell if hes manipulating me whenever I see him, or if hes genuinely my friend down and down his luck. I really wish I could help him find that strength inside him to ditch these pills and move on. But I'm not sure if it's ever going to happen.

WIBTA if I cut this friend out of my life?

Edit: My friend comes from a wealthy family, he has been in rehab before, and believe me I've tried to convince him to get real help.

My question isn't if I'm TA for giving him the pills, my question is WIBTA for cutting him off/abandoning him","YTA you know better than to be dealing drugs to a drug addict. You should never of told him you get a prescription for pills you don't even bother to take that he is heavily addicted to, wtf were you thinking? He needs to work out his recovery with his doctor because he needs those pills for his mental health issues, not just because he is an addict. 

I think it would be better for both of you if you're not in contact with each other for a while.

Since he was also confused, he asked his mother. While I didnt turn in his mothers work, I used it as a guidline. A lot of the information in the two papers where different.

We're kind of LDR and we see eachother about twice a month on the weekends. Back in September we had a huge fight that led to us almost breaking up. We made up after, but I was still reeling a bit as it was the worst fight we've ever had and brought up some issues we have with eachother that we had never openly communicated before. A couple days after we make up, our relationship feels a bit awkward and unsteady but we both feel like we've finally voiced our feelings and are hoping to work on the issues. 

Onto why I might (probably) be an asshole: I meet a guy at my college literally two days after we've had this fight and make up. We were both waiting for a vending machine and he had a boosted board with him. I'm into skateboarding and was kinda looking at getting a boosted board  so I asked him about it and he started telling me about how nice it was and how much it cost and stuff. Then he asked me about my major and we talked about school for a little bit while I got my food. I say bye and am walking away with my food when he asks me for my snapchat, and I give it to him. He messaged me and we talked about our school and the weather and shit for maybe a week and then he asks if I wanna hang out. Ngl I really wanted to try his board so I say okay. I've been telling my boyfriend about this the entire time and he says he's fine with me going skateboarding with this guy. So I go skateboard with him and afterwards we sit down at a Starbucks and talk for a bit. I got the vibe it wasn't really a date but it also kinda could have been. I didn't mention having a boyfriend. We parted ways and didn't talk again until a couple weeks ago. 

He messaged me asking how I was doing and I probably should have just ignored him but I didn't. I felt rude just leaving him on read. We make small talk and he asks me if I wanna hang out and I say okay. The day before we're supposed to meet up I slip the fact that I have a boyfriend into conversation. He's still down to meet up so we did. We haven't talked since. I told my boyfriend he was texting me again but I didn't tell him that we met up.

I, on the other hand, have an extreme sensitivity to caffeine and therefore avoid coffee like the plague. Literally have never tasted coffee and likely never will. 

My wife and I take turns doing the dishes. Invariably there are dishes related to her coffee drinking every single day. Given that I don’t, and never will, use any of these coffee-related items, I don’t wash them. I leave them in the sink for her to wash when it’s her turn to do the dishes. I will certainly wash mugs that she used and put them in the dishwasher, but cleaning everything else is tedious and time consuming.

My daughter is overweight. Not anything too drastic, but she is around 5’4 and 155 pounds. So she could stand to lose a few pounds. I’ve been concerned about her weight for a long time. None of it has been helped by my also-overweight, enabling wife.

On her 19th birthday, in August, we went on a hike in the state forest. She complained about it literally the entire time. She didn’t like that it was hot, she didn’t like the incline, she didn’t like the mosquitoes. I still encouraged her and pushed on, I think she was satisfied with having exercised at the end of it. But, while we were driving back home, she knew that we would be driving past a Dunkin Donuts. She wanted me to stop so she could get herself a “birthday donut.” I said no. She was upset about it, saying she just wanted a donut and she’d just done this long hike to please me on her birthday. I argued calmly that she didn’t want to undo all the work of the hike by getting a donut. She said the one she wanted is 350 calories (which I doubt is true) and would fit into her day. I pointed out she’d probably be eating cake later. We didn’t stop and she sulked about it on the whole ride back.

It tells a story about a ruthless billionaire who falls in love with a hooker and becomes more human in the end. I’ve never seen this film before and we agreed that we would watch it together today (she would watch it 6 or 7 times). So we watched it and SPOILER ALERT in the end Gere’s character develops to a more compassionate person. He cancels the deal that would put other people at risk and so on. And Roberts’ character decides to quit hooking and go to college. But! In the very final Gere on his white limousine rides to her apartment with flowers and they leave this place together. 

Now here’s where fun begins. After we had finished watching, I presumed that as a director I wouldn’t rather put in the movie the limousine and shit because it’s a cliche. It’s like modern Cinderella. I said that it could’ve been better if they split up after making each other better. It would make a nice, bittersweet ending. I added that this final was quite trivial. 

I never thought she would take it so personally. She argued that it was the best ending in the history of cinematography. She almost cried.

BoTh of these girls are slobs to the point of leaving trash to pile up and make the apartment smell like garbage and dishes in the sink to the point that if anything else was put in the sink there would be an avalanche of moldy dishes everywhere, trust me, its happened, and they just stayed on the floor.

I'm not perfect. I'm a bit of a mess myself, but there is a difference between being messy and being disgusting. I may not be able to see the surface of my desk due to school and art supplies, but I know when to take out the trash and how to do my own dishes.

I don't live in my apartment during the summer due to a better paying job back home but I come up every once and a while to check on the place and get away from my mother. Its always a fucking mess.

Garbage bags everywhere, pizza boxes everywhere, sink FULL of dishes and gnats just chilling on every surface due to the level of filth that the bitch had left.

I clean it all.

I throw away most of the plastic dishes that were in the sink due to the level of nastiness that covered them. Think that gross algae stuff that grows in stagnant ponds. That, but worse.

I cleaned the kitchen from top to bottom, something that hadn't happened since I stopped using it due to the pigs that I lived with.

Then, I looked in the fridge.

You wouldn't have been able to fit a bottle of water in that fridge it was so full. It also stank like something died in it.

I cleaned it, top to bottom, and threw out everything that wasn't alcohol and wasn't out of date and moldy.

Everything else went in the trash. Pizza boxes, take out containers, tupplewear, milk that had been in there since may, eggs that had been in there for a VERY long time, and 7 MORE pizza boxes went into 4 trashbags that got chocked FULL by nothing but shit from the fridge.

It took me 4 trips to take all the garbage to the dumpster, and I have a 4th floor apartment and its over 100 degrees every day. My legs and arms were SCREAMING after all those stairs.

I then proceeded to clean the fridge, top to bottom, and didn't stop until the thing smelled only of lemon and bleach.

I put the 3 things that I deemed ok to stay.

An unopened bottle of red powerade that I later drank because there was nothing else and I felt as though I deserved it for all the hard work I just did to clean the apartment, some beer and wine coolers, and a tub of butter were all that I put back in the fridge.

My girlfriend and I only speak English with each other. I’ve asked her to teach me Spanish, but she finds it difficult because she’s a native speaker so she just knows things and can’t explain them to me, which I understand. I am learning Arabic for my graduate degree so I can’t study Spanish on my own time right now, but plan to in the future once I finish my degree. 

We have lived together for over a year. She works full time while I’m in school. We split the chores/daily responsibilities and one of mine is the grocery shopping. 

Okay so that’s the backstory. 

The issue is this: 

In the area where my girlfriend is from, she (and her family and friends, I checked) call the green citrus fruit (what i would call a lime) and the yellow fruit (what i would call a lemon) “limones” which translates to lemon in english. So they call both of them by the same name, to be clear. 

At first I didn’t know this. So whenever she asked me to buy lemons, I bought the yellow fruit. Then one day we went to the store together and she called the limes lemons and I was like ???? and the discrepancy was revealed. 

Now, whenever we are cooking or I am going to the store, she says lemons (but she means limes). I said, well what if you want the yellow lemons? And she said “I would never use a yellow lemon” so. But for some reason it really bothers me! Like, is it /that/ hard to call it a lime a lime, even if you learned it differently? But her counter is, I should just always assume she means “lime” when she says “lemon”, but for some reason this drives me crazy!!

So, solve this discussion for us. 

AITA for wanting her to call limes limes??","YTA-Obviously, only barely given how small this issue is. Think of it this way, depending on where you grew up in the US, you could call cola either 'pop' or 'soda'. If your partner grew up in different region, they might say the other. But it would be kind of annoying for them to ask you to always use 'pop' instead of 'soda' when you grew up saying 'soda'. You would likely have to catch yourself saying 'soda' every single time . In your gfs case, this minor annoyance is compounded by the fact that she's already speaking in her second language and likely has to dealt with minor syntax mistakes on a daily basis.",1,YTA,1.0,1.0,1
136,"AITA for complaining to my 5th grade child’s school for their sex education program? My daughter’s 5th grade class is having a sex education week this week and yesterday she came home and I asked her what she learned.

She told me basically what I’m shocked to think they’re teaching children that age and then she showed me a condom that was given to her.

This morning I walked right into the principals office and demanded to know why they were giving my daughter condoms in sex Ed (as well as why they’re teaching her about oral and anal sex other more advanced topics that are age inappropriate).

The principal insisted that I leave immediately and to instead send a letter if I feel so strongly against “proper sex education”. She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.

On the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.

Guys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.","YTA- What exactly do you think sex education is? It’s education about sex. I guarantee you they probably told the students something like “you can still get stds from anal and oral sex”

137,"AITA for trying to get my sister to use birth control? Hey everyone,

F23. My identical twin sister (also F23 just in case someone doesn't get it) just got married to (M25). My sister is a very religious Catholic and therefore, among other things, doesn't believe in birth control. My brother-in-law does support birth control but has conceded to the wishes of my sister.

Anyways, my Sister at 23 is really young and is not done her schooling. I am horribly concerned for her, feeling that not using birth control will ruin her life. My sister simply responded that they will use 'natural family planning' and 'pulling out' and will just have very little sexual activity for the next two years till she finishes her studies. I think that she is just making her husband and herself miserable, and is honestly not being fair to him. Besides, I love my sister and want to help her. So I have been attempting to convince her on a very regular (around weekly) basis to use birth control based on its merits. My sister however has just been getting annoyed, saying that I am attempting to interfere in a very personal manner.  However, I feel like I am just trying to stop her from making a horribly stupid lifestyle decision, which would very easily ruin her career, and even her marriage.

140,"AITA for not inviting a classmate to my party and lying to him about his invite? For some context I go to an international school so my class is quite small and close knit. As a result, there aren’t any clear cut social groups in our school but they do somewhat exist. There’s one dude in our class who isn’t really friends with any of us and he’s been trying extremely hard to get into our peer group so he can get invited to parties and seshs. He’s not a bad person or a dick but he is obnoxiously overbearing 24/7 while being a massive FOMO (fear of missing out). A year ago, our class went on a school trip overseas and this dude tagged along. He annoyed the **** out of me and my mates the entire trip, constantly trying to insert himself into our conversations and barge his way into our hotel rooms to join into the card games we were playing. It got to a point where I personally told him at the airport to “f*ck off and stop being an annoying c*nt” making it clear to him that we didn’t want him in our group.

Recently, one of the girls and I hosted a double 18th, inviting most of the class except for this kid. Both of us strongly didn’t want him to come, since we knew that him being drunk would amplify his obnoxiousness. Some of my mates told me that it would be a dick move if I invited most of the class but not this kid, however, I was adamant in this decision stating that I absolutely had no obligation to invite him. He pissed me off even more when he spoke to one of my mates to convince me to invite him proclaiming some bullsh*t about “setting aside our differences because I don’t want to miss out”. This along with the fact that he didn’t even invite me to his own 18th (I wouldn’t have gone even if I did receive an invite) finalised my decision not to give him the green light.

This brings me onto the situation, I was discussing the party in class a week before it happened and the dude was eavesdropping on the entire conversation. Suddenly he asks me if he was invited and I sorta muttered something about “lemme see the list and I’ll add you to it” bs. I didn’t invite him in the end and carried out the party with my class.

146,"AITA for telling a girl she's flat chested and basically ugly? So this happened several months back. Sometimes I (17M) still get shit for this. 

I was waiting to go into class and there's an acquintance (17F) that I know that was also waiting there, along with some other girl friends of hers. Anyway I was looking at the posters on the wall and then around. Was awkward wait cos none of my friends had shown up.

As I'm minding my own business, she just shouts ''Eww are you staring at my tits??''. I look bemused and she says ''Throwawayiromeo is staring at my tits''.

I didn't appreciate that and can be quite brutal with comebacks so I instantly said back ''Hahaha don't flatter yourself. There's nothing in your chest area to even look at''.

She looked shocked and flustered for words, so I started laughing to myself. She then started crying and her friends started calling me all sorts of names.

Teacher comes and asks what happened, they tell her and I get a shouting at. I'm asked to apologise but refused so had detention for a while. Now I'm all in the clear. Whenever that girl sees me, she always looks down at the floor.

I don't like hurting people's feelings, but when someone tries to disrespect me or make me look like that, I always just lose any emotion and go right for them with the insults. The thing is, I wasn't even checking her out. I think she's ugly (got a skinny and weird body) and spots on her face, so I don't know why she deluded herself into thinking that anyone, let alone me, would be checking her out.

148,"AITA for abandoning my friend at a club due to a panic attack? Prefacing the actual story, I suffer from ADHD and sensory processing dysfunction. Whenever sensory overload occurs I tend to react extremely irrational. I also want to state that I made my friend aware of that shortly after we met a year ago or so. Still, my condition does not stop me from attempting to get into situations where sensory overstimulation may occur (such as a party/club), after all, I cant just crawl into my shell all day long everyday.

Yesterday, I was in such a situation. My friend and I decided to have a night out at a local club to celebrate her newfound job (shes been jobless for a few months) and just to have a good time in general. Things started out well. Shots were poured, laughs were had and stories were shared.

After about 2-3 hours of fun, she suddenly decided to get a cig. Unfortunately, she didnt bring any herself. Instead, she decided to simply go into the smokers area and ask around if anyone was willing to share. She asked me if I would join her, but as an non-smoker I decided against it.

So she left me to my devices and went for a cig. 5 minutes turned into 10, 15, 20 minutes. Slowly, the effects of my last shot were fading away and I started to realize how full the club had become. Music started to appear louder to me, people kept shoving past me and I just felt left alone and sensory overload started to creep in. I felt anxiety and nervousness take hold of me. 

I started contemplating trying to find her and tell her but I decided to suck it up and stay put. Dont ask why, but for some reason I didnt want to disturb her smoking session.

Just as about 25 minutes had passed, she suddenly returned. With a guy in tow. She offered him drinks and asked him to join us. I politely shook his hand, but my brain somehow percieved him as just another load onto my already overloaded brain. I also didnt want to put up with being third wheeled that night either.

So thats when I snapped. My brain was in full fight or flight mode. When she turned to the bar to order new shots, I simply grabbed my coat and walked out. I eventually reached a bus station and got a ticket home. Only when my anger and panic started to fade the realisation crept in that I am probably a massive asshole and moron for leaving her alone in a club at 2 AM. I quickly messaged her, apologizing profusely but trying to explain I acted purely on instinct. She was pretty drunk so she was just confused.

However, as I woke up this morning I tried to call her to talk it out and she just snapped at me for not telling her that I felt unwell and accusing me of not trusting that she would understand. Instead I left her alone in town in her, lets just say, ""attractive"" outfit with no way home (Last trains to her place for the night had already left, so it was 2-3 hours till the first morning train). Which is totally fair, thats exactly what I did. I just hadnt thought about any of it while in full flight mode.

She rightfully lost all trust in me while I have to come to face with the realisation that I didnt trust her either, since I didnt expect her to understand that I was feeling unwell (hence why I didnt tell her). But am I really the asshole in this situation, or should she have been more considerate?

_____________________________________________________

There's this girl, Lily, who's been a good friend of mine for a few months. I kinda fancy'd her, to be honest, but she has/had (not sure) a boyfriend, so I respected it and never did anything about it.

Last thursday I was away from my home country, I was in London visiting my brother. She called around dinner time, sobbing, saying her boyfriend cheated on her with a ""friend"" of her. She said she wanted to be with me, and I told her I was away until monday (today). She said alright, I told her to call me back in a few minutes because I could talk while I made dinner. She never did call me back.

Since that night, I texted her once a day just saying ""hey lily, hope all's alright with you. I noticed you went [somewhere she put on her insta story], hope you had a good time. Love you, kiss"". She never replied to any of those.

Fast forward to today, I sent her a message asking if she wanted to lunch (no answer), and two hours later I asked her if she wanted to grab a coffee before my class. No answer either. I didn't really mind because I'm used to people taking a while to reply. However, after I get out of my class, I find her at the entrance hall of our university, chatting and laughing around with the guy who supposedly cheated on her a few days ago, and some other friends. I got damn pissed at that and just left without saying a word. She didn't really acknowledge me either. I feel like she made me look like an idiot. I honestly don't really want to hear any explanation, if it were a misunderstanding with her boyfriend she has a few days to tell me, but she said nothing at all.

151,"WIBTA if I lie to people and say I'm infertile? So I'm a (27F) recently married woman, and so, while it doesn't happen too often, I get the ""so when are you having children?"" question.

I think asking this of a woman is incredibly rude; there are a few people in my life who have struggled with fertility issues, and imagine being devastated that you can't have your own child only to be reminded by friends, family and strangers every time they ask ""when"" you're having kids.

I don't want kids. My husband knows this and accepts it, I've mentioned it to our parents on multiple occasions, most of my friends have known since high school. I won't get permanent contraception until I'm older, as I know there is a chance I will change my mind, but it hasn't happened yet and odds are it won't.

But any time people ask when we're having kids (sometimes I interrupt and say 'actually you should't ask that, maybe start with ""would you like to"" instead of ""when""', but often it catches me off-guard or they don't ask directly and just talk about my future children to me?), and I tell them ""hopefully never"", I get the standard ""ohhh you'll change your mind"" and ""it'll be different when you have your own children"".

I've never lied to anyone in response to this question, but I would really really like to. I think the whole assumption is disgusting, and rude as hell. And every time, I am tempted to blurt out ""actually I can't have kids, thanks for reminding me"" to shock them into realising how inappropriate it is.

But this would make me feel awful for people who really do suffer from this issue, for making light of it and using it just to avoid a conversation.

I don't think I ever would do it, but I am tempted so often. The people I would use this response to would be incidental acquaintances, maybe even extended family who I don't see often, and only if they ask in a particularly brash or presumptive way that irks me.Immediate family of course deserve the truth about my health from me, even if they refuse to believe I don't want children.

WIBTA?

INFO: I have a friend who had to have her tubes removed, and I asked her once WIBTA if I did this? She never wanted kids either, but it was still a difficult time for her. When people ask her when she's having kids, she tells them straight that she can't. She gave me the go ahead.  


I am a carrier for a degenerative condition, and there is a chance (we won't know for sure unless I have further tests) I could pass it down to any children I have. Sometimes I follow up with this information when people try to insist I will want kids, but instead of backing off, people offer up suggestions for procedures and things to avoid passing it on, so I usually don't mention it.

I have never tested my fertility, but have no reason to believe I would struggle to conceive.

Thanks for any comments, I am really interested to see how people would feel about this.I don't think I would ever do it regardless, but would just like to gauge how much of TA it would make me if I do snap one day and say it.

EDIT: Thanks everyone! I really appreciate the candour. I get quite frustrated sometimes but that is no excuse to throw decency and respect out the window.I think my new response will be ""I won't be having children"" as it sounds a bit more concrete than ""I don't want kids"", and I will make sure to firmly tell people that I think their questions and remarks are inappropriate.","YWBTA.

153,"AITA for hosting my daughter’s sweet 16 MY way?  My only child was born around the time of May that Memorial day falls. So, it’s become a tradition for me to host a large family gathering around that time, since the guests are off work. It’s nominally a birthday party. Some guests bring presents sometimes, sometimes not, and we have cake (*we* do, anyway, if my daughter does not eat it, that is her choice). But you could also call this party my yearly family reunion.

The problem is, ever since she was 11 years old, my daughter has been influenced into thinking she’s a vegan. As much as I persuade or sneak things past her, she hasn’t willingly used hide nor hair (ha!) of an animal for almost five years. Not even wool, which is really inconvenient for my shopping considering the fact that she grows like a weed.

Every year, she asks me to change the menu of her/my party to be meat free, milk free, and even egg free. In dramatic teenager fashion, “*I don’t want animals to be killed for my birthday*.” I tell her that she can’t control how other people eat. I’m obviously not going to look cheap to my family by serving them rice and beans. Nor will I be making alternative slop just so “she has something to eat.” There is plenty to eat, and it is gorgeous, she just chooses not to. Last year, she even did make a second cake out of pumpkin or some such. It looked ridiculous and went in the trash as soon as she’d cut a slice to eat with he rest of us. I am an excellent cook, and I like the table to look a certain way, especially when my *darling* sisters-in-law are here to nitpick.

This year, after the usual request to change the menu, my daughter “told” me that she won’t be attending her own birthday party. Instead, she’s going to meet friends at another girl’s house, where they will eat leaves and talk about her “mean mother” I’m sure. Ha! I told her she’s being ridiculous, that she’s not a real vegan anyway since I’ve been cooking the family’s rice in chicken broth for the past five years. (Rice is often the only thing on the dinner table she will eat, since she can’t see the meat.) In typical fashion, she cried and stopped responding.

So now I have a dilemma. I can’t exactly force her to stay and act convincingly happy, although she does know there will be consequences if she doesn’t.

I can let her win this little power struggle and change the menu of the party. This will teach her that If she kicks her heels long enough, she can force other people to bend around her weird demands.

Or I can host the party my way, and have my family awkwardly asking “Where’s the birthday girl?”

I could re-brand the party as a family reunion, but there will be questions, and family has already asked me this year about “her birthday party.”

They are a true example of the Immigrant American Dream; they are affable, generous, and responsible. However, there have been some growing issues over the years, and I can't help becoming resentful towards my parents. 

1.	Estrangement of my older sister 

Two and a half years ago, my older sister had an emotional falling out with my parents. When she called me over the phone to explain her side, I disagreed with her position. I did not expect that she would cut me off along with my parents. 

I did not get to speak to my sister for two years. I began to resent my parents. Although I thought they were the ""right"" side in the argument, I believe that they dealt with the estrangement badly and I blamed them for my sister’s refusal to communicate with me. Though my sister lives only a 1 hr. drive away and works in the same city as my father, they have never tried to go to her apartment or workplace and talk out the situation. They told me to wait it out, and took it for granted that ""family duty"" and her ""good senses"" would bring her back into the fold. That was not the case. I have only gotten to speak to my sister again because I physically searched for her (ringing doorbells, doing internet people-searches) and tried incredibly hard to reconnect. 

1.	My mental illness 

For five years, I have had chronic depression with irritable episodes, and my parents have not known how to deal with it. I understood that they come from a culture which does not discuss mental illness (they are Asian immigrants), but I have brought them to sessions with my psychiatrists and they never seem to understand that they have a role to help when I have an episode in front of them. They seem to have the mindset that once I stop crying, the pain has passed. Therefore, they simply look at me or wait for me to run into another room and cry myself to sleep. It hurts.

My parents have been really generous in their financial support (e.g. full college tuition) and are really affable people. They have sacrificed a lot for our family. My successful mother chose to be a stay-at-home-mom, and my dad has never had hobbies because he was making a living for us. I know that they love me a lot.

However, it is the way they deal with emotions and pain that aches. When I explain to them that they've hurt me and my siblings, they claim that nobody would have given them an inkling of the same support they've given us. It is true; they grew up in a rural Asian village where the idea of emotional support and mental illness is barely a concept. They theoretically want to be better, but they have only marginally changed. I am considering cutting ties with my parents because I want to prevent continually being hurt in the future, although I know that would give my loving parents two estranged daughters.

There isn’t much backstory, except that my friend started sleeping with/dating a girl in high school (she’s of legal age in our state, but we’re all graduated and ~19). I didn’t really have a problem with it but I did think it was kind of a weird situation. 

Then, two days ago, I found out through somebody else in our circle that the girl in question had tried meth just that night. Needless to say I was pretty shocked, the heaviest drug any of us in our circle do is weed, and meth is at least three fuck tons worse than that. Naturally, I expected the friend dating her to cut it off ASAP since it was pretty fucked up. But, days passed, and we didn’t hear a peep out of him about the subject.

But everytime he gets to choose electronics time it's straight to Minecraft YouTube videos.

160,"AITA for expecting my family not to profit off me? My stepdad is selling a snowblower he got out of his mother’s garage after his mom last died this year and since I need one my mom said I could have it for $100.

AITA for feeling it’s a little shitty to try to profit off a close family member? He got this snowblower for free and knows I desperately need one; my husband and I bought our first house last year so we’re starting from scratch. For context my mom and step dad are very comfortably retired due to my step dad’s substantial retirement savings and stock portfolio. He’s a nice guy but a bit of a tightwad and always wants things to be “even”—for example, when they were dating he insisted that they set a Christmas gift budget for each other based on a percentage of daily earnings so it would be “fair and equitable”. He also insists that going forward the Birthday person treats everyone else instead of everyone treating the Birthday person so no one is obligated to subsidize anyone else’s Birthday experience; otherwise he thinks it isn’t fair since he splits meals with my mom and picking up the tab for their birthday dinner is less expensive than them paying for mine or my husband’s. 

For the record I’m not this way at all— I’m always very generous and never ask for anything in return. For example I spent $150 in June hosting an elaborate Father’s Day dinner for him, and I always bring snacks or treats when I visit their house. We were rather poor growing up because my mom was a single parent working in a restaurant, real dad was a deadbeat, etc. What little we had was shared freely because it had to be- we never kept score. My mom’s financial situation only improved after she married s.d. a few years ago. My stepdad is very affectionate and caring toward me, but I think he’s so tight about money from his f-ed up childhood and living alone/never married/no kids until age 60. Considering he got this snowblower for free and presumably doesn’t need the money, AITA for thinking it’s right to share what you don’t need if it will help someone you care for—for the overall good of the family?

*As an aside, he’s getting on in years and we are his only family besides a half brother. Despite the fact that he’s 13 years older than my mom he thinks she’ll die first due to her heavy smoking, and he’s made numerous comments about moving into our guest bedroom someday so I can take care of him. He always includes “I’ll pay you rent!”.

TL;DR I need a snowblower; my stepdad got a snowblower for free and offered to sell it to me for $100. I think he should give it to me for free in the spirit of bettering the family and promoting mutual care.","YTA. Not for asking, but your mentality screams entitlement.

A little background (trying to keep it as short as possible).

My fiancé was not accepted by my family for different reasons, which I could not accept (mainly because he was not good enough for them). After years of trying to convince them, years during which my sister sent me really aggressive and nasty messages, I've had enough and married my fiancé last year. And I mean, we did it all, civil wedding and a beautiful church wedding with more than 100 guests. I did so because I didn't want to have a secret wedding just to tie the knot, knowing that my family wouldn't attend. Long story short, they didn't, and the few days leading to my wedding were really ugly. Two days before the wedding, my father tried to convince my fiancé to cancel the wedding in exchange of   
 accepting our relationship, getting to know each other and having the wedding next year. In my eyes, it was just a tactic to get us cancel the wedding, gain time and ultimately reject him. It ended in a fallout with my family.

It was the first time I didn't spend Christmas with my family, or that I didn't call my father for his birthday. It was not easy, but honestly it wasn't as difficult as I feared it would be. I felt relieved from not having their toxicity around me.

In April, my sister called me because our grandmother was hospitalized for pneumonia. My grandmother is now 102 years old and I feared that she would not survive it. I packed my bags and went to Korea for a week to spend time with her. It was very awkward because my father told me that he couldn't keep me from seeing her but that he didn't want to see me. The rest of the family did everything to keep us from bumping into each other. It was not an easy week, but at least I got to talking with my mother and sisters again.

Now, I've been trying to get pregnant for more than a year, and although I know it's not that long, given my age it's really frustrating and disappointing. My sister, who got married a month before me was trying as well and just informed me that she was now 12 weeks pregnant. She sent me a picture of the ultrasound and let me know that everything was good and normal.

Of course I am happy for her, but I can't help feeling angry. I think it's very insensitive and selfish of her to parade her happiness around me, well knowing that I'm trying as well. Both sisters don't understand why I can't be happy for her and think I'm really bitter.

Recently, he’s been getting a little better and has been sober for a few weeks, but yesterday when I visited his house he had a bunch of (unopened, but still) whiskey bottles sitting on a shelf, plus a whole bar cart. I asked him about it, and he said he wanted to have alcohol around in case his friends visit, so he can make them drinks. I figured he was most likely either lying or rationalizing to himself, but I decided to play along and told him I don’t think his friends would mind (I know them, and they’ve all been really supportive, so I doubt they’d be pissed off if he didn’t have alcohol when they visited). He insisted they would, and I asked him to tell the truth: was he really keeping them for friends, or did he think he’d mess up and drink again, and is just keeping those for then? He admitted that yes, that was what he was doing. I remembered a Harvey Specter quote that was really relevant- I’m not sure if this was the exact quote, but I got the essence of it- and quoted it: “see, this is what addicts do. The moment they start making progress, they fuck up. Because they think that it’s just a matter of time before they fall and fail again, and they’d rather fall from the 3rd floor than the penthouse.”

This pissed him off, and he said I had no right to judge him. I told him I’m just calling it as I see it, and if he continues like this, he’ll fail again, and again, and again.

Anyway, whenever I take the dog out for a walk, princess likes to follow me, and prince will occasionally come with as well (just like he did in this case) they are perfectly fine with our dog, and in fact, if anything, the dog is more uncomfortable around the cats than they are around her; that being said, they don't really like other dogs. While I was walking them I ended up with another person, walking their dog, walking in the same direction I was coming from, the cats after seeing the dog immediately turned around to get as far from the dog as possible. I had been with them for a good \~20-30 minute walk by this point and was on my way with them back (the walk I was going for was a circle, so I could go both back and forward to get home) walking forward would only take like \~5-10 minutes while going back could very easily take over 30 minutes, as the cats have a habit of not really wanting to follow, especially later on in a walk, so that'd take it's time (I'm a super paranoid person so I'm always worried about if I leave them behind they'll get lost) I asked that person if they could be careful with their dog (they were in a leash, but doubted they had seen the cats so was just making sure they wouldn't be taken by surprise and scare the cats as well. The cats (being cats) were absolutely NOT willing to go in the same direction as a random dog was coming from and immediately turned around and walked the way we came from; seeing this the person in question ended up just saying 'I guess I'll just go back.'

I thanked them but felt a bit guilty, and later saw them at a nearby hill playing with the dog (wasn't paying full attention as I was trying to keep the dog satisfied and calm the cats down) anyway, I was able to calm them down and continued in the direction I was moving in, seeing this they decided to move ahead of me and continue in a detour around me (depending on where they were going this could've been like a 15-20 minute detour instead of just waiting on me to finish calming them down and walking the way I came from) seeing this I felt super guilty for forcing them to do that and while I doubt I inconvenienced them a lot I feel I could've just turned around but didn't realise that fast enough (I'm not entirely sure I would've though as I was getting tired and dealing with cats that are getting scared of not knowing where they are for a long time wasn't exactly what I wanted to deal with)

178,"AITA for making a joke? I actually made a reddit account just to post this.

So, for context, I'm a 20 year old Indian-American girl and a college student. I was born into a Hindu family but we're not really religious (not sure if this is super relevant, but anyway). This is about an exchange I had with another student at my university.

One of my classmates is a Muslim girl, also 20 and Indian-American. Let's call her Sarah. She's a nice girl, pretty smart, seems chill. I wouldn't describe us as ever having been friends, but we're in the same major so we've taken classes together and talked a handful of times, only ever for school-related stuff. She also wears the hijab, and usually wears them in a variety of colors and patterns (this is important). I get the vibe that she doesn't really like to talk about her religion, since the few instances I've seen other students ask her about Islam she's given them very brief answers. I've never talked to her about religion before.

Anyway, a few days ago I was standing with a group of four other students after class and talking about a test we had just gotten back. Sarah joined the group and I noticed she was wearing a black hijab (which seemed unusual to me since, like I mentioned before, she's always worn colorful ones). I commented on it, casually, like ""Oh hey Sarah, your hijab is black today."" She seemed kind of confused but just said ""Yeah."" At this point it was a little awkward so I said something like ""Don't you usually wear different colors?"" to which she replied ""I match my scarves to my outfits."" Everyone else in the group was quiet by now. As a sort of joke, I said ""I see, I was asking because isn't black a weird color to wear for a hijab? It's kind of an ISIS bride thing, right?""

She got really mad. She just said ""No?"" and rolled her eyes, said ""I'll see you guys later"" to everyone else in the group (she purposely looked at everyone BUT me) and left. After she was gone, one of the guys in the group told me that the joke was in bad taste, which I can admit. But it's been almost a week and Sarah won't talk to me at all. I've tried to start a conversation with her a couple of times and she just cuts it off. I don't think I did anything really wrong--sure, the joke might have seemed offensive, but it's not the end of the world. I'm not an Islamophobe or anything like that, it was just a joke. I honestly think she's being immature by refusing to even talk about it.

Group of friends for about over a year, decided to stay connected, created a shared group chat. No new additions until this event. Several semi-relevant friends not in group chat but are like recurring characters in a sitcom, familiar, see every once in a while. One in particular doesn't sit well with me from several prior bad incidents, has annoyed other friends as well (G). Recently, one of the friends added them (G) to our shared group chat. Chat has history log, several prior events/planning/activities they were not invited to as well as some personal information. I remove G. They get mad.

Ask friend who added G why, they said G wanted to join. I do not. Ask friends who have been annoyed by G if they want G to stay. They're indifferent. I still do not want G. Make it clear to G that I am opposed, they have annoyed friends in past, not welcome to group chat, especially history logs. Happy to create new one with G, but not established chat. G asks why AITA, gate-keeping friends if rest are indifferent. Still refuse, G is welcome to create his own. G insults me, proceeds to ask each of the other friends in the chat privately if they do not want G in the chat. They are indifferent. G takes this as personal offense, me lying about having said many were annoyed in the past. I still offer new chat. G accepts.

G in new chat renews discussion now with full attention. Frames me as blocking, garners sympathy from friends. I disagree, I do not want G from prior incidents. Fine with two separate chats. G accuses me of being major A-hole, I feel I have a right to my opinion of who can be in group chat even though I am not admin or mod. Friends are indifferent, want drama to end.

I find this guy that sells them at a flea market, he has an online classifieds ad, more for advertising his stall than selling them. I emailed him and buy about 15

We start talking details and he asks me how I would like them delivered, he offers me the choice between the post office and a private company that does counter to counter deliveries. I hate this company; I have been burned by them before. I don't tell the guy this, I just pick post office, its known to be shitty but I personally have never had any major issues

The guy agrees, he also says he is getting in new stock and am I willing to wait for them to come in, I wait another week and buy another 10 or so, I also go through the list, realize there are some I missed and order more. Our emails are really informal. It’s like we are two comic book nerds talking rather then it being a business transaction. I was hoping to be a returning customer.

185,"WIBTA if I asked the father of my child (I’m 4 months pregnant, he is not my BF) not to date anyone for the next 12 months? I don’t know if it’s just hormones making me crazy or if my concerns are reasonable so guys please tell me what you honestly think.

I’m currently 4 months pregnant with my first child. The pregnancy is accidental and the father is one of my good friends. Abortion is not an option for me and he respects that. We are on the same page about making the best of the situation, and our priority is ensuring that we can be the best parents to our child even if we’re not together. Our families are supportive of us and are excited about the prospect of a grandchild, as none of our parents are grandparents yet.

My pregnancy has not been the easiest and I recently moved in with my child’s father (I’ll call him Lance) so someone can stay with me most of the time (he works from home). We’ve been getting along well, but sometimes it makes me feel uncomfortable when Lance tells me about the girls he’s talking to on Bumble. 

For the record, I don’t think he’s doing it with the intention of being rude to me. I think it’s just a habit that he’s used to - as I said, Lance and I are good friends and in the past we would always talk about the people we like or we’re seeing – maybe he just doesn’t think that anything would change now that we have a baby on the way. I get where he’s coming from and I know he still has a life to live outside of being a father to our child, but reasonably or unreasonably I feel uncomfortable that he is looking for a romantic relationship now when I think that our attention should be focused on preparing for our baby (converting a room into his nursery if we continue to live in Lance's apartment, learning how to change diapers/bathe a baby, etc). 

I’ve been thinking about asking Lance if he can hold off dating until our baby is about six months old.

186,"WIBTA for reporting my GF to her boss? Hello r/AmItheAsshole. Throwaway for obvious reasons. Back in September I made a custom mug as a birthday gift for my mom. When I went to pick it up at the local Walgreens, the girl (I'll call her G) working there commented on my Rick & Morty shirt then we got talking. I was immediately into her but too afraid to ask her out, also wasn't sure if she was just being nice. So I just leave feeling regret, but later I get a text from a unknown number, it's G. She apologizes for contacting me like this & asks if I'd wanna hang out. Obviously, I'm down & couldn't care less about how it happened. Flash forward to now & we've been dating for almost 3 months, things have been great.

This past weekend the two of us hung out with my older sister (I'll call her S) when the subject of how we met came up. (Some context: Couple years ago S had stalker problem. She donated blood & a staff member lifted her info then used it to start harassing her on Facebook. Thankfully she never got hurt but did have to change her phone number & get a restraining order against the guy.) I fucked up, and never considered it might be a sensitive issue so when G starts I just let her. She left nothing out. I could see right away that S was upset, but she played it off & didn't comment. As soon as G went to the bathroom S asks me if that was all true. When I said it was she tells me how that's not OK & I need to report G to her manager. I try to downplay it but she's not letting it go. She knows exactly where G works & I'm almost certain if I don't do it, she eventually will. I haven't mentioned any of this to G yet since I don't want the two to argue. I'm considering it only because I feel like S will do it in a way that will get G fired. WIBTA if I report her?","YTA

She's hadn't had non veg food for a while. We go get some chicken shawarma and then we're just talking and I'm also casually sending out some emails.

I'm a hard core vegetarian. Not even egg. She knows this.

Not that I have a problem with other people eating non vegetarian food around me. I am okay with other people around having non vegetarian food around me.

191,"AITA for not apologizing to my friend after making her cry? I have a friend, we'll call her Charlotte, who I am not particularly close friends with but I find her very oversensitive. She is considered one of the ""popular girls"". Unrelated story but to give some idea of how sensitive she is: A few days ago, we took a test, and afterwards Charlotte told two other people what was on the test as they were taking it after her and this gave them an advantage because they knew what to study. Me and a couple of my close friends confronted her (and her two ever-present friends) about this and she defended herself by saying that she was only telling one person and the other just happened to be in the room with them. We told her that was still considered cheating and she flounced away with her two friends following her. We later found out that she was crying over being called out for this.

A week or two before that, she and a few other people skipped basketball practice because we were going to have a different coach for most of practice while our regular coach was busy. The regular coach is a lot more lenient than most and doesn't make us work very hard which Charlotte likes. Afterwards our regular coach was mad and gave us a lecture on how we shouldn't be skipping practice. The team is small so the absence was pretty noticeable. Afterwards, a friend who wasn't on the team, but is very into basketball and does it competitively, had asked on a group chat why Charlotte was texting during basketball practice, so I said that she had skipped. The friend couldn't fathom why anyone would skip basketball practice and asked her why, and Charlotte responded that she was skipping for ""personal reasons, something just came up"" when I knew that she had been planning to skip. So I said so in the chat, also saying that the coach was mad. The friend continued to berate her for skipping and I agreed with her, and then Charlotte left the chat.

On the way to school the next morning, I got a phone call from a mutual friend saying that I should apologize to Charlotte because she was upset and crying. This pissed me off because Charlotte was talking to me through friends, which is something that I hate. If people have an issue with me, they can tell me themselves. So I decided I would not apologize to her until she herself decided to talk to me. So as I was leaving class, two of her friends, one of them being the person who called me that morning, came up to me and told me that I should apologize because we had a game that day and Charlotte was thinking of not going because she was so upset. This made me even angrier and I nodded along with them but I decided I was definitely not going to apologize now.

192,"AITA? My wife won’t meet my friend because she says he abandoned me when I had cancer and I think she should forgive him because I have. Throwaway just in case.

All this started as a small discussion with my wife and it has morphed into an actual argument.  

About 4 years ago and only a few months into dating my now-wife Diana, I was diagnosed with a pretty advanced cancer. It came as a huge shock to everyone, but Diana never left my side since. She went to all my doctor's appointments, sat with me through 3 months of chemo and took care of me after my 2 major surgeries.

So the day I was diagnosed, I was also admitted to the hospital and then rushed into surgery the next morning. It all happened so quickly. When I had a second, I sent out a text to my closest friends telling them I was in the hospital, the doctors confirmed it was cancer, but that everything was going to be OK. I said I had just had surgery, so I couldn't leave the room to call them, but they could call Diana if they wanted to check in or else text me. Plus I didn't wanna disturb the other guy sharing my room.

One of my best buddies I will call Chris never responded to my text. He actually hasn’t spoken to me or texted me since - completely ghosted me. I tried a few times to call/text, but he never responded. It was very out of the blue for me since Chris and I had been part of the same group of friends for nearly 15 years. At least we knew he was OK though because a mutual friend would occasionally see him.

So fast forward 4 years and I heard from the mutual friend that Chris wants to hang out with the group again but he’s worried it will be awkward since so much time has passed. I assured the mutual friend that it would be great to see Chris and catch up and I want him to meet my wife.

Well Diana says she won’t go and she doesn’t want to meet “the asshole who abandoned his friend when he needed him the most”. I tried to explain to her that Chris was going through a tough time when I got sick and it was not personal. And full disclosure… during a particularly rough week of chemo I had a breakdown and I shared with Diana that I was very hurt by the way Chris stopped talking to me. So now 4 years later, Diana says I can see him all I want, but she refuses to meet him because Chris ghosted me a few years ago and has never said he was sorry or tried to reach out himself. Doesn't help that Chris was the only person to react that way. 

Except none of that bothers me anymore and I am cool to just pretend nothing ever happened and move on. I don’t want to push Diana, but I think she is being childish about it. Am I the asshole for wanting her to get over this? She has never actually met the guy. We fight about it every time I bring it up. I say life is too short to hold grudges and she says life is too short to waste your time with people who have proven themselves to be bad friends.","NAH, except for Chris.

If you want to forgive and move on, that's fine. But it sounds like your wife felt very alone when she could've used more support. And she couldn't go to *you* because, well, you had cancer. But I imagine if you talk to her about that time in your lives, she's talk to you a lot about worry, stress, sleepless nights, while trying to keep all the ""normal"" stuff going. (Did you ever do laundry during that time? Take the garbage out? Clean the bathroom? Or all the other mundane tasks that need to happen even when someone is very sick?)

I was planning on paying for the date, and in the middle of this process the girl told me that she told me that she had a great time and she thought we could be really good friends. So I got the message that she didn’t like me like that. 

When the waiter came to collect the check I told him to just put my meal on the card. The girl looked pretty confused and said she thought I was paying and that she couldn’t really afford the amount this cost. (It was around 100$). So she couldn’t really pay for it. (Her card got declined) but she ended up just splitting it on two different cards(idk if I explained that right).

We talked a lot and found out we had very similar life plans for things like family, home, etc. This got me pretty excited so I asked her if she was single. It turned out she was not, but still she wanted to hang out with me. It also turned out she is going for a student exchange starting in February. We started training new dance moves together even outside the course and also to cook and play board games. We started to meet 2-3 times per week and have done so for the last 3 months.

I said to her that I would not accept that my GF met some guy many times a week. The answer of she maybe being with me was also quite frustrating.

Still it is pretty clear that we also have romantic interest in each other even though we don't hug or do anything else romantic as I want to appreciate her relationship.

208,"WIBTA if I told my professor about my best friend's plagiarized project? My best friend, who we will call Joe, and I are in our last year at college, and we are only a couple of weeks out from graduating. We are taking a class together, and we are required to create a final project instead of taking a final exam. This is a circuits class, so our goal is to build our own circuit. We are supposed to use what we've learned in our class and lab sessions, along with what is in our lab manual, to help guide us on our projects, but we can also use online sources if we want to go beyond what is provided in the class.

We MUST provide a disclosure for what sources we took ideas from to avoid plagiarism and academic dishonesty. However, the exception to this is that you cannot take entire, already-made project ideas from these sources, even if you discuss them in your disclosure.

Joe is a great guy, and I've been close to him ever since I met him in my second year. I've gone through a lot of depressing stuff throughout my time at uni, and he's stuck by my side. But he's always had this habit of doing his work at the last minute, mooching off of other people for answers, and scraping by to pass his classes. There have been a good number of nights where I have stayed up late with him to help him understand what is going on in the class or to guide him through a problem, only to end up doing the problem for him. If our peers or I can't help him, he'll find the answers online. It's a tad bit frustrating.

We had to give a presentation to our professor that gave a projected idea of what we were going to be building for our final project, along with a schematic of the circuit we wanted to build. Joe admitted to me before the presentation that his entire schematic was ripped from something he found online. When the presentations happened, Joe handed my professor some papers that he had printed out (no one else did this but Joe) and showed off his schematic. Our professor did not say anything asides giving general feeding, as he did with the rest of the class.

I have a feeling that Joe was not entirely honest on the papers he gave our professor, and I don't think he will be honest on his disclosure for his final project. Everything is due in a handful of days, and Joe is still confident that if he ""cites his sources"" that he will not be penalized for ripping his entire project from an online source. I just feel conflicted about this situation because he's my best friend, and I would hate for him to be kicked out of college for academic dishonesty. But, if he decided not to go through with this, I know that he won't be able to come up with another idea in the amount of time we have left.

TL;DR: We can't rip our entire final project ideas from any sources, but my best friend is doing it anyway. He's most likely going to get away with it unless I do something about it.

212,"AITA for wanting to donate toys to kids this holiday season, but to have a choice on who and where they go to? I mean that in a more general sense, not literally handing out toys to different kids right in front of their eyes.

Basically, I'm in my early 30s and have been a bit of a geek over the last decade, just going to conventions and collecting various things. All the while thinking that for the rest of my life I'm going to cherish and hold on to all this merch I collected. But while the fond memories of my geeky past will certainly remain, I've found that I'm not nearly as attached to some of this stuff as I once was. Not only that, but I'm also planning a big move in my life to attend graduate school, and am drastically downsizing and consolidating all of my stuff. I don't plan to buy a home or settle down in that regard any time soon, and the prospect of either having to cart this stuff around everywhere I go or paying monthly for a place to store it long term just seems ridiculous at this point.

I literally have 3-4 of those big plastic containers full of modern and vintage toys. Again, at one point I thought this was my all time collection and that I would be holding on to this stuff for many years. I'm not talking high end figurines here, just regular good quality toys, most of which are still in the original boxes. Think 40 Year Old Virgin on a smaller scale. Which brings me to the reason I have to ask this question. 

Not only did these items have importance to me at one point, they also weren't cheap. And the effort and comparatively small amount of money I would get by selling them really isn't worth it. So while I don't mind giving them to children, I just want to make sure these toys are going to good homes, to put it simply. That they will be appreciated and not just junked. 

Not only that, but a lot of new parents are in my peer group, and I see many of the dumb horrible decisions they make that put them in their circumstances. And I can't help but think I'm enabling bad parenting by donating my hard earned stuff because they can't provide for their kids themselves. I don't mean to sound harsh, but it's the reality of this generation of parents. 

I don't mean to sound so cynical, but if I wanted to donate to Toys for Tots or some other drive thru charity, I'd go buy a basket of toys from the cheap toy store and donate those. I'm trying to do something good here, but these were also once my prized possessions. And at the end of the day, I'd rather sell them for cheap to another collector who I know is going to take care of them or re-sell them to other collectors, than just hand them off to some charity to be junked not long after that. 

I don't know, I was thinking of maybe a children's terminal cancer ward. That way I know my toys are going to kids who will appreciate them. Those toys will live and die with that child. And then whatever happens to that toy from that point is none of my business. 

So, reddit, I ask you, AITA for feeling this way?


*","""Enabling bad parenting... Can't provide themselves"" I think YTA for this statement alone. 

Look, I can appreciate wanting your toys to go somewhere they'll be used a certain way. But if you give them to kids, they'll get played with in a way you wouldn't want them to. Even at a children's hospital.

I am genuinely confused whether my stance on this makes me the asshole... 

I am in high school, going to college in a few years.. my father got a promotion in work so we'll be relocating really far away from where we are now. 
I have a GF in high school who I've been together with since 6 months now. I really love her and obviously we didn't tell our parents about this as we're in high school. She has a sister who knew about us and she decided to tell her mom about this relationship. Ironically she was in a relationship too with a much older guy and my GF didn't tell her mom about this. Now the pressure is on her from both of her parents giving her the silent treatment.. so I asked GF to snitch on her sister too (her sister is 2 years younger and had a bf way older than me) so she's out of the line of fire. GF declines saying that ""I'm the elder sister, and I won't do this to her"" 
I replied saying that your sister should've thought about this too but she didn't.. its not about what's right anymore because your sister crossed the line.. its about saving yourself. Am I The Asshole? #1

Her mom doesn't approve of us and wants us to be just friends and be in a relationship when we're ready for it. GF doesn't want to disobey her mom. 
My reasoning here was that I'm going to relocate in 1 month anyway so why not be together for my last moments here? I said that as much as I would love to marry you in 10-15 years we both know its not going to happen and its possible that we're never meeting again. 
She tells me to have a little faith in God and if we really loved each other we will meet... I said that life is harsh and the bitter truth is that we are never meeting again and we both will find someone else.

216,"AITA for not dedicating a performance to my husband Throwaway account.

I (25f) am an actress, and I recently booked a lead role at a substantially sized theatre in the city where my husband (30m) and I live. I have been struggling to get gigs, and so when we found this out we were both elated. He has always supported my dreams of becoming an actress, and due to the nature of his job I have been lucky enough to pursue this dream without us worrying about finances. He is the love of my life and I am so lucky to have him.

Two years ago, my best friend took his life. He was a stage manager, and we always talked about how we would move to New York and work on the same shows together. We had been friends since college, and we were each others favorite people. My husband and I met shortly after college, so they have known each other for some time and we've always all gotten along.-Side note, my best friend was gay, so there was never any kind of romantic jealousy-When he passed away, my husband was there for me every step of the way, and has been my rock through all of this.

When the time came to write a bio for the show (what shows I've been in before, college, etc.) I decided to dedicate my performance to my late best friend. I didn't even think about telling my husband, because I thought he knew how much it meant to me, and that it didn't change anything about our relationship.

However, on opening night, my husband was incredibly angry. He said that he was thrown off, and since I'm the lead, that it was embarrassing that there was another mans name in the first bio of the program. A bunch of our friends came to the show, and he said that it was embarrassing that he wasn't mentioned, after all he had done for me. I tried to explain to him about what my friend and I used to talk about all the time, but he wouldn't listen, saying he was too hurt to talk about it.

AITA? I didn't realize this would be a big deal, but from his side I can see how he would feel slighted for not being mentioned.

What we really wanted was a private court hearing just us and our 6 year old son but about a month and a half ago my mother started going on about how she would be so upset if she didnt get to come and witness it (dont need witnesses to get married here). Since the courtroom would be empty and mom made a big deal we invited everyone interested because we cant let just her come and no one else.

219,"WIBTA for giving my cancer stricken mum an ultimatum? Well.  


My mum is going through her second chemo therapy because of lung cancer. She has been heavily smoking (half a pack or whole pack a day) for nearly all her life, even when she was pregnant with me (I somehow managed to turn out relatively fine, thanks to whatever miracle).  


My father smokes, too. I've been getting shit for this nearly all my relatively young life. I couldn't invite most of my friends over because of the smell, my clothes reeked badly of smoke and that's why I got bullied a lot in school. I moved out and things have been less ""stinky"". I was blind to the smell nearly all of my life, but now I am able to percieve it like everyone else around me. It sucks. I often tried to reason with them, I nearly begged for them to stop often enough, but they never cared enough to do so.  


First time she got cancer I was on a trip in New Zealand and as soon as I got the news I aborted this little adventure of mine and returned home to be there for my family. After a lot of therapy and all that, the cancer was defeated, but scar tissue was left in her lung, with a very small chance for the cancer to return. We were all happy. They were still smoking.  


Now 6 years later, the cancer came back in full force. Doctor said without a second therapy she would've died in a few days due to it growing so fast and blocking important vessels in her lung. She started therapy and even though it is probably too late, my dad stopped smoking. In front of me, he threw away all of their lighters, tobacco, etc. When mum returned home from her first session, she bought a pack and continued. Dad tried to fight his urges, but gave in.  


Now the side effects of her therapy are kicking in. Weakened immune system, all that jazz. The last chemo session was postponed and she is getting loads of antibiotics and vitamins pumped into her.  


So. WIBTA if I visited my mum one more time, just to tell her ""quit or you'll never see your son, his wife and his children ever again"" ? I do not know if her getting cancer is completely her fault, but I guess the heavy smoking took a really huge part in that.   


So, yeah. Just be honest.",">just to tell her ""quit or you'll never see your son, his wife and his children ever again"" ? I do not know if her getting cancer is completely her fault, but I guess the heavy smoking took a really huge part in that.

This seems to indicate that you’re making an ultimatum for the purpose of convincing her to stop smoking. And that is a REALLY BAD idea.  Right now she most likely needs emotional support more than ever, and burning bridges with an ultimatum will probably decimate her emotional/mental state. And feeling awful about losing a connection like that won’t solve any of her problems, it would just create more. **You would definitely be the asshole** (YTA).

I suppose this ultimatum would be more reasonable if she was always acting mean to you besides smoking itself (like a “you had this coming” sort of thing).  However, none of what you said suggests she was intentionally acting maliciously on you; she just couldn’t get hold of her addiction. It’s not like she smoked for the specific purpose of hurting you, yeah?

I sense that you’re considering this out of good intent, but this would be a big mistake that would probably lead to a lot of regret, anger, and even more smoking down the line.",1,YTA,1.0,0.0,ERROR
221,"AITA for abandoning my friend at a party? So for some context, I recently moved to university and before this never really partied much, except in private settings. Coming to university I decided to try something new and go to a party if I had the chance. 

One of my good friends from class invited me to a party, and I accepted. I met up with him, and one of his friends at the party. Immediately I felt very uncomfortable, as I had never even had a drink before and you could see people basically grinding on each other in the corner of the party. I didn't feel comfortable at the party, but I decided to stick it out and see if  I began to enjoy it. My friend got drunk, but I prefer to stay sober for personal reasons and was getting very uncomfortable.  I decided to try and help my friend hook up, then perhaps do something else. His other friend helped set him up and, wanting to give him space to converse, I moved away. Finally, feeling uncomfortable, both at the party and with the idea of informing my friend that I wasn't enjoying the party and interrupting him while he was chatting up a girl, I left without telling him and found an all-night gaming party which was much tamer and had an amazing time.

Later on that night he texted, asking where I was, and I informed him I was at an all-night gaming party then. 

However, I feel uncomfortable with my actions as I abandoned him without telling him after he invited me and likely made some considerations for bringing me along in his plans and probably waited for me at the original party when I didn't tell him.

But at the same time, while we went to the party together, it seems reasonable to say that what somebody does at the party is their own prerogative. Like if he had hooked up with a girl and left without informing us, I think that would be fine. So in the same vein does it make me an asshole for finding something I enjoy without telling him? 

I am likely going to apologize the next time I see him, but I would like to know whether or not what I did was assholish.","YTA - you should have just let your friend know even if it was with a text.

We desperately needed to fill two customer service  positions, I ended up setting up 5 potential candidates who were all interviewed individually. The first three interviewed on Monday and one candidate stood out (""Jack""). The managers told me to tentatively let Jack know that he was going to be offered one of the two positions. They wanted to lock that one down. I told him this after he sent me a follow-up email.  

They interviewed the remaining two on Tuesday. All of a sudden, they changed their minds and said they made their final choices and they wanted the last two. I asked about Jack and they told me that he was never formally offered anything. He went from Choice 1 to Choice 3 after everyone was interviewed. If Choice 1 or 2 declined, then he would be an alternate.

I called Choice 1 and Choice 2 and they accepted the offer yesterday. I told the managers that they put me in a bind by telling Jack he was going to be offered a position and they retorted that the offer was tentative. I began to understand what they meant - tell people they are their first choice, until or unless someone better comes along. I explained that's not how it works.

She is currently unemployed (her parents pay her half of the rent) and when I come home at night, everyday I sweep the trail of dirt and leaves on the floor, wipe all the crumbs off the counter, all the oil splattered on the stovetop, do all the dishes, take out the trash, etc. She also has a dog that has separation anxiety and pees on the floor whenever she leaves (separate story, he’s been to the vet multiple times and she is “working on it”), but I usually end up the one who cleans all the pee (he’s a big dog and it takes about an hour to clean thoroughly so it doesn’t leave residue or ammonia stains on the hardwood floor). I’ve talked to her about my issues several times and she says I’m being ridiculous, and she would clean the dishes if I hadn’t cleaned them first. I decided to test that and left her dishes in the sink where they sat for 5 days before they started to smell and I cleaned them. I’ve talked to her about everything but everything seems to get shrugged off. 

It has really started to make me angry that I work 12+ hour days and come home to do more work when she’s home all day and doesn’t do anything. I would honestly be okay with all the cleaning because it’s 20 mins a day and it’s not THAT big of a deal, but she’s been having her boyfriend over every Friday and Saturday night. I feel like after a long week of work all I want to do is sleep in and have a quiet peaceful Saturday, but I usually wake up to them talking (he talks very loudly) at 9 am and then they start day drinking and dominating the living spaces so I can’t cook or watch tv on the couch until 3-4. 

I haven’t yet said anything about her boyfriend because I understand she pays the rent too and I want her to be able to enjoy her own home, but I’m starting to feel like I don’t have a weekend because it’s always so loud and I never get a rest period. I think I also feel like since I put a lot more work into the apartment I deserve to be able to have privacy and quiet on the weekends. I just have read that it would be overbearing for me to say anything because she pays just as much rent and I can’t control her. Other than the noise, he isn’t bad and doesn’t eat my food or make a mess or anything. WIBTA for telling her she can’t have him over at all anymore but I would be willing to take care of the dog if she decides to leave for the weekend. He has a 1 bed apartment with no roommates) 
Moving out is not an option- I’m in grad school and working and still barely making ends meet and she is unemployed aka neither one of us can afford a new security deposit, moving costs, etc, and both of our names are on the lease

EDIT: the cleaning issue is not relevant to the issue of me wanting a relaxing weekend OTHER THAN I feel like she has a history of taking advantage of me.

I explained to her that I really do just need one day a week to have a quiet morning and since we both pay rent it’s not fair that she’s 100% happy 100% of the time and I’m not.

S goes to bed a few minutes after me and turns the overhead fan on high.(theres three settings: low, medium, and high). turning the fan on high makes it way too cold for me, so i kinda drift out of sleep and wake up really cold. with the fan on high AND the ac on, its gotta be like below 65 degrees in the room. so i turn the fan on low because its freezing. 

S must have heard me, i have no idea how, but woke up and started yelling about how theres no need to turn the fan off. i was just like what?? its way too cold in here. 

so my exact words were: ""i wake up freezing with the fan on high and the AC on. its not fair for you to set the temperature for the room and tell me i cant change it since we both live in this room. the best compromise is turning the fan on medium because its the middle setting."" 

S: ""no way, thats not fucking fair. I'll wake up sweating."" 

me: ""if you wake up sweating wear lighter PJs"" (S wears these really heavy material long shorts and a long shirt to sleep)

S: ""no, you can just get another blanket and long pants"" 

me: ""in the middle of the fucking summer???"" (i already wear a cotton shirt and light shorts to bed)

i really thought this was ridiculous for S to say, but at this point i had the remote in my hand bc i had just turned the fan to low. S literally *lunges* on top of me, scratches my leg in the process, grabs the remote, and yells at me saying that i can wait for S to fall asleep and then turn the fan off.

i pointed out that S was contradicting themself because they had just claimed that they wake up sweating if the fan isnt on high.  

at this point S just started yelling at me, so i yelled back about how S is 22 years old and acting like a child, how S never moved out and doesnt know how to compromise in the real world, etc.

S just turned the fan on high, still yelling, and left the remote next to their pillow so I wouldnt be able to reach it. i just thought, fuck this, im tired and im not gonna act fucking childish like S. 

so AITA? i thought i suggested a fair compromise but im not sure now. also i was way too exhausted to ""wait for S to fall asleep"".","YTA

244,"AITA for not telling a homeless man that his last surviving relative has died? 
I work for an apartment complex full time. I work out of our off-site promotional center near a busy street in the city and, because I am located in a larger urban area, have homeless people come in looking for donations all the time. Today I had a disabled homeless (who was possibly a little drunk and delirious) man come in asking for some food and water. I gave him a bottle of water and he saw that I was working on my computer so he asked if I could google a variety of addresses for errands he wanted to take care of.  After I found and wrote-down the address for a few things, he asked if I could look up his nearby aunt's phone number so he could get in contact with her. I typed in her name and city and the only results were obituaries where his name was listed as a surviving relative. I didn't want to make him upset than he already was at the moment, so I just told him I couldn't find anything.  

AITA for not informing him of this death? I definitely don’t think he was an AH in any way. He said his last contact with her was ten years ago and the obituary indicated that she died two years ago. He mentioned that the rest of his family had already passed.

She says she has social anxiety and thats why she can't get a job or go to school or talk to anyone. The problem though, is that shes never really been diagnosed by a doctor, she just self diagnosed herself. 

For as long as I can remember, she hasnt wanted to do anything with her life. She wanted to be an actress but her so called social anxiety is stopping her. She even tried Youtube but her contents trash and shes not exciting.  

Shes lived at my house almost her whole life, staying in her room on her computer all day. There was a whole year when she was nocturnal. She slept at 10am and woke up at 6pm. But she moved in with my grandparents for a couple months before going back to my house. 

Its not like any chance we get we tell her she is worthless and wont amount to anything, but I just get so frustrated with her immature tantrums and whining and under the breath statements. She gets mad over the stupidest things. Once I ate a chocolate chip cookie she made without her permission and as ""punishment""  she held me down and tried to shove a very, almost black, burnt cookie down my throat. The thing was so sharp it cut my face in three places when she missed. 

What im trying to say is having her at our house all the time is really inconveniant because ahes sleeping in the living room so whenever I go into my own living room she gets mad at me for being in her ""room"". She dowant have a job and doesnt go to school and my whole family is fed up with it. 

A couple of days ago she mentioned to her friend on the phone that my parents and I were emotionally abusing her because my dad often says that shell never to anything with her lifw and that she has no authority and should get married and leave us, and I often pitch in. I know its mean but trust me if you lived with her youd be frustrated and desperate for her to leave, too.

253,"AITA for not taking care of a back problem and now our weekend is ruined  I (30M) have had a bad run of back problems in the last 6 months. I have had one or two tweaks in the distant past but this summer I tweaked the area between my shoulder blades doing push-ups. A few weeks later I slipped a disk in my lower back while just sitting hunched over. For reference, i'm very active, I typically go to the gym or run 7-8 km 4-7 times a week.

Onto the matter at hand. My Wife (28F) and I are in the middle of reno's and have not been out camping / drinking / having as much fun as we typically would be in the summer. For August long weekend we had our first back country camping trip booked. a 40km 2 night / 3 day hike with just our back packs. Unfortunately though, this last Sunday (6 days before we leave) I sneezed and ruptured a disc in my lower back. She has never had and back problems so i feel she doesn't really get how week and useless you can feel. I think she feels like I am faking / over reacting, but i'm in a fare amount of pain but its always way worse in the morning at work and then when i get home and see her its loosened up and i'm for the most part mobile. it makes me almost want to fake being injured more at home so she will believe me.

When I told her I wouldn't be able to go she kind of lost it on me. She blames me for not taking enough action the first two times. she said she told me to go to physio and i didn't so now I've ruined her weekend and my poor choices are now effecting her. I feel this is hypocritical because she over-trains all the time. She will routinely work out 7-15 times a week. it drives me nuts and she can have a limp afterwards but, she claims its different because its never effected me and she has a monthly standing physio appointment.

For me, I felt attacked. I feel she was literally adding insult to injury. I told her i couldn't believe she was more focused on her weekend then me and she even tried to ask me if i would just bike it. I told her that i didn't want to be the person solely responsible for her happiness and that if it meant so much to her to take it into her own hands and go her self or get a flight some where. I told her that it bothers me that even though there is nothing I can do about it now, she is intentionally doing what she can to make me feel bad about it.

we have for the most part made up, but emotionally we still both hold our originally positions, so it doesn't feel resolved. i have a chiropractor now and am looking into physio. AITA for not going to physio after the first / second issue?

So, one of my cousins said I could stay with her while shit hit the fan at my house. I told her I was waiting for things to cool down at home and for them to have a discussion about what happened and so forth. We talked about how me moving in was a huge thing because she has three kids, who I’ve been apart of their lives since they were born, but there’s issues. One has adhd and anxiety and depression, another is on the spectrum, and the other is just a typical 9 year old with a huge heart. This past weekend my family had a discussion and I told her I would probably be going back home this week, in front of the kids. So Monday I woke up, packed up and left. Kids were at school and my cousin was at work. I didn’t think to text her (and probably should have tho on my part) because I had said something, and just went home, slept all day because I’m lazy, then went to my boyfriends for the night. 

Well, tonight I got a text saying she was upset with me for not telling the kids I was leaving and that she admitted her daughter to a psych ward. Now based on conversation from when I stayed there and that text I feel like it’s my fault for not explicitly sitting down with each kid and telling them I was going back home though they were all in the room when I told their mom I was. I feel like me leaving threw this girl into a downward spiral and I’m why she’s in the ward. Her issues with her dad were him telling her she isn’t welcome at his house and he doesn’t make time to do things with just her so she feels abandoned and I feel that she now feels I abandoned her. Which I didn’t. I still fully intend on going over and hanging out with the kids- it was just time for me to go back to my own house...

My girlfriend and I live in a New York apartment and essentially we ended up with a fairly large living room but have a small bedroom (we have one roommate). The bedroom is small enough that the bed has to be pushed against the wall and so you either have to scoot yourself the end of the bed or crawl over the other person to get up if you sleep on the wall side.

Now here’s where the potential asshole comes in. So, there’s been at least 6-8 occurrences where I’ve brought out waters to a table where the guests happen to be Asian, and they request that I get new waters with no ice.

I'm a college student who got back for Thanksgiving break, and I really wanted to relax and wind down in my room this week. Nothing wrong with family gatherings or being social, but it's called a ""break"" for a reason, right?

So, we recently got a new kitten. (I'll put a link towards the bottom of the post because she's cute) But I finally got to spend a little time with her (never had a cat, we're dog people), so I wanted to understand our kitten better by figuring out what toys she likes and if I can set up some spots for her to hang out in my room. She really seems to like my room, especially my bed, because she isn't allowed in the room when I'm at college. She's been a bit of a roommate this week.

Unfortunately, this leads to the younger ones barging in to play with and pet the cat, which annoys me because they never knock or ask to come in, nor will they leave if I ask them to because ""wait, one more minute,"" (repeat 5 or 6 times). They just stand there at the edge of my bed, distracting me, talking my ear off, and invading my personal space. I've started to shut the door (not locking it after the reaction I got from my step-father), but alas, tweens know how to open doors, so that really doesn't stop them. Plus, the kitten doesn't like not being able to see the hallway through the doorway. Anyways, I'll admit that I've started being a little snippy when they stay for more than a minute for no good reason, and telling them to ""either take the cat with you or leave without her, but either way, you need to leave NOW.""

I will also make sure to spend much more time with the family and either do my work before I leave or just let them in even if I am working, because they haven't seen me in a while, and my work can probably wait.

I'm involved in some clubs on campus of which people of every sexual orientation and gender identity are a part of. I'm very fortunate to be involved in things with such acceptance and diversity, and usually we all just coexist.

Recently, theres been a lot of joking about how ""everyone here is gay"" and ""straight people aren't even real.""

I really feel like I don't have the right to ask them to stop because I'm sure they've heard that however they identify isnt real over and over in their lives, and I truly have had a privileged life. Sometimes I just feel like the joking is a little hypocritical. 

It feels like such a minor, irrelevant thing so I should just keep my mouth shut. On the other hand, those kinds of jokes just make me want to not be around them because I would never joke about their sexual orientation or gender identity in that way.

280,"WIBTA for not telling my friend that his girlfriend is cheating on him? So here is the situation. One of my good friends has a girlfriend and they have been dating for like 2-3 years now. The girl is frankly speaking way out of league when compared to guy. Like damn I have met her once and it was like Angelina Jolie dating your average gamer. Though my friend is a surgeon so you can see why he got the chicko.

Anyways my friend is actually quite a good surgeon and hence his workload is quite high ( He is a bit young also so as the dictum goes, young gets all shit work by senior surgeons also). 

Now I have met them both and so we all are on good terms and I have both of their numbers on WhatsApp. And yesterday evening I saw a status update of her kissing cheek of another guy. It was a lucky catch as she was drunk that time I think ( Most prob got drunk with that other man and who knows what boinking they must have done lol). She removed the status in like 5-10 mins but I had definitely seen it clearly. 

She messaged me saying ' Please don't tell him. This was mistake. ' yes she was drunk so her sentences weren't making sense. I said I won't tell to anyone that moment.

Now today she messaged me again and she was clear in senses. She asked me to seriously not tell her bf ( my friend). She said it was just a mistake and she had no intentions of having any relation with that other guy and that other guy was just a friend ( Yeah she was making lame excuses here lol). 

She then said it will ruin everything as her family will get her arranged marriage to someone if she loses a surgeon as potential mate ( we are in India so showing your bf to parent is a huge thing). 

However I haven't told my friend yet. Why? Because I don't want to get involved in such a big drama. 9/10 I will be center of attraction in this. I don't know if anyone else had seen or not but I will be trapped in this then. My friend has a tough job as you can see and he will be DEVASTATED to hear that. He is a good natured guy. Look I am a doc as well and I have a tough life also. If I get involved in this, then it will ruin my peace of mind also.

Would I be the asshole to keep this information so as to not ruin an apparent happy relation? I can see why the girl will chest considering the guy is a busy man and prob unable to satisfy her. 

Someday or other this will get exposed and I think that will be a better thing as I won't have to handle the work that comes with it then? 

So am I the asshole or would I be the asshole then?

Ive been in a relationship with my boyfriend going on 3 years now . He has 2 kids from a previous relationship which in itself has been a huge adjustment. He is 27(m) and I am 25(f). When we initially got together he didn't mention the kids and so it was a surprise to me . Kind of a turnoff but I liked the guy so I stuck around. His kids mom is as crazy and obsessed as they come . Everything the first year was an issue because I was in the picture. She wouldn't let him see his kids ,and she'd pick and choose when and where and for how long. He would go without seeing them for months due to this. His kids are small 5 and 3 both girls, sad thing is due to all of the drama his 5 year old has the mentality of a 15 year old and carries out insults and conversations her mother talks to her about to try and cause friction. Now ironically his 5 year olds birthday is on Valentine's day . For some time his mom or sister would be the ones to contact his babymama for visits . Just recently tho his babymama said that wasn't good enough and needed to have direct contact with him or no go on the visits. It's really bothersome to me because of how toxic she is . So my boyfriend is trying his best and has begun messaging her and calling her to see his kids which he hadnt seen in 3 months. The other day I asked if he was gonna ask to have her for Valentine's to which he said yes . I gotta admit I was bummed .. things have been Rocky lately and Idk what I expected but that wasnt it. I got a little quiet with him and he got really upset and said I was being dramatic and that he sees me all the time. He also told me that he needs to be a dad and to stop thinking the way I do because its stupid.

 I can't put myself in his shoes as I don't have kids and I wouldn't know how to deal with this but I also feel so much pressure. I really tried the first year we were together by doing birthdays and holidays with them but I always was talked negatively about from both his family and his babymama. I got tired of trying and I stopped coming around especially because his oldest daughter would say things like ""daddy my mommy was showing me pictures of you two kissing , you love my mommy huh"" he would just tell her not to talk about those things and that,that was a long time ago ... Honestly it would get me really upset because I know she doesn't come up with those things on her own.. as I mentioned before I've been around going on 3 years now ,the other day i seen his kids and his oldest said ""hi  ohh what's your name again , ummm ,umm hey you what's your name?"" He told her stop playing you know her name and she got serious and said oh yeah I remember now .. idk why but that really got me going...

287,"AITA for not wanting to meet my family member's associates and vice versa? Hello, /r/AmItheAsshole.

I don't care about my family's opinion on the people I want in my life, whether they're work associates, friends, or romantic interests. Therefore, I don't want to introduce the people I choose to be in my life to my family. I don't want to hear their opinions, and so I have concluded that simply not introducing these people to my family members is the easiest way around having to hear what they think. Additionally, I think I might have some kinda of social anxiety or phobia over doing so, but I'm going to exclude that from my rationale because I don't think that simply because someone is scared of something that it's a good enough excuse to avoid doing it. Anyway...

So, I live with my grandfather. It's just he and I, and I've only been living with him for a few months now. It's been nearly a decade since grandma passed away, and at some point he's found himself a new lady friend. I know he's lonely, and so I'm genuinely happy for him that he's got someone with whom he can spend his time. I'm happy for him, but I don't care. I have no desire to know this person at all whatsoever. I don't know how long he's known her, but today was the first time that he's brought her around the place. 

I heard him drive up and I went into my room as to get out of his way. I didn't know he was bringing her over, he told me nothing of his plan to host her and he certainly didn't say anything about his expectations regarding any sort of introduction between she and I. Long story short, I stayed in my room the whole time, doing what I usually do (internet, games, discord, etc). I didn't come out, and now they're gone.

So, the tl;dr of this entire scenario is that my grandpa brought his lady friend over and I didn't take the time to introduce myself to her. Am I the asshole?","YTA.

So he asks the question, my brain has an evil turn, I chuckle to myself but don't say it. Old mate sees the chuckle, and desperately wants to know the thought. I tell him multiple times that it's too harsh, even for this environment. Eventually he pushed it until I gave in..

Friend - 'so who does my kid look like the most?'

Me - 'insert name of guy the wife cheated with.'

Needless to say, it didn't go down all that great. I apologised. Even though I hadn't wanted to say it at first, I could see that my friend was hurt by my words.

So I work in an office space with cubicles. Some of the cubicles have printers in them and some do not. As a result I was sending my prints to my colleague’s printer and sometimes other people from other floors would send to hers too if theirs are down or something (hers works the best). 

I do not like this coworker because she has spread rumors about me before to people including my supervisor and spoke about me in a poor light when I had just started working there; it was weird because she didn’t and still doesn’t even know me. I’ll also mention that I’m 23 and she’s 45 in case that matters. 

So she had stepped out for a long while this one day and her computer was up and my other coworker and I both went to retrieve prints from the lady’s machine and that’s when we both simultaneously saw it... the screensaver was slideshow of the photo album, which had pics of the lady in her bra, her bare a**, other suggestive photos, inappropriate memes and what could have been a failed vag photo (couldn’t really tell but it’s likely). We just stood there shocked and watched pic after pic, holding onto each other and screaming after each photo (lol). It was a trainwreck but also hilarious to me that I of all people saw it given my relationship with this lady. 

My coworker (who I’m friends with and is also my age) asked me if we should stop it and I said no while stopping her from moving the mouse. l said whoever sees it, sees it. It’s weird that she has ANY personal photos on the work computer in the first place tbf, but especially semi-nude and nude ones. I don’t feel sorry for her if people had seen it. 

Other people had gone to the cubicle to get prints too - idk if they saw any of the risqué ones or what but if someone did see it I know there would be plenty gossip since they are so chatty around there. 

My sister asked why we didn’t at least turn off the monitor, but that lady is evil in my books so eff her and whatever happens as a result?

What do you guys think? AITA?

edit: Just want to clarify a few things.. this was not a scene that we made and nobody else saw our reaction to this. There are no cameras by the cubicles. Also I may have verbally “stopped” my friend from ending the trainwreck, but she could’ve stopped it if she wanted to. Neither of us feel any guilt over this situation because this lady is horrible. I didn’t go into details of why I called her evil, but a few of them:

Her lies about my character stopped me from being able to transfer to another section because the other supervisor got wind of said lie and rejected my request to join her section though she initially accepted; my other coworkers were initially icy to me and I wasn’t sure why and I found out months later that it was because lady evil told them I spoke negatively about them. I’m cool with the rest of them now because I’m not the witch the tried to make me out to be, which they eventually learned just interacting with me; the other present coworker had to report her on a prior instance for releasing confidential information that present coworker dealt with - she could’ve lost her job over that. I also have no interest in having a relationship with this coworker because she’s lazy and fake: I heard her call her work “friend” ugly to someone else and she said another emp. dressed like a whore. I don’t know how she gets away with many things and I reported her recently for screaming at another employee. That’s the kind of person she is and that’s only some of the things.

 Sorry for the confusing title, there’s no easy way to explain this. (I know this reads bad, just letting you know I never planned on either donating or sleeping with her)

Ok. So my girlfriend (24F) and I (23M) were asked out to lunch by our good friend (24F). 
She said she had something important to ask us so we heard her out. 

At lunch she asked me if I would become the father of her child. I’ve been in a relationship with my girlfriend for a few years now and this took us both off guard. Basically, she said she wants my genes for her kid. I knew she had a crush on me for a while now, but I didn’t have any clue about this. 
To make the situation worse, she doesn’t like the idea of sperm donation and just wants to have a one night stand with me in order to get pregnant.

My girlfriend was understandably livid. I had absolutely NO intention on having a one night stand with her, but I wasn’t so quick to oppose sperm donation verbally. I WAS NOT GOING TO AGREE. but just didn’t say anything . I didn’t think it was that insulting to my gf at first and was more confused than anything. 
Both my girlfriend and I weren’t planning to have any kids or anything like that and our friend promised us I could sign a contract so I could never be held responsible for child support. 

Point is, my girlfriend is mad at me because I didn’t outwardly and verbally  reject the idea of having another woman’s baby. I DO NOT want to and DO NOT plan to. I’m just baffled by the whole thing, but apparently I’m an asshole for not being so quick to reject this. (again, to clear up confusion I NEVER considered being a donor, just didn’t say anything)

Am I? Should I be so quick to say “of course not!”
AITA for not saying no abruptly? I said I wasn’t going to sleep with our friend... but my girlfriend still hates this whole idea. I haven’t decided what I’m doing yet. I’m just confused. 

Sorry if this makes no sense, I’m still a little out of it.

Edit: just making it clear, I told my friend I am definitely NOT going to sleep with her. I am NOT going to donate. Trying to be as clear as possible. 
I just didn’t quickly shut down the whole sperm donation idea quickly. I DO NOT want to do it, but I think I sounded like I was entertaining the idea. Which I’m NOT. I just was at a loss for words at the moment. I think my silence sounded like I was considering it. 

Though after reading this thread I think I should’ve shut it down faster and clearer... 
My girlfriend definitely gets some roses tomorrow for putting up with my dumbass.

Edit 2: Yeah, big old red flag here. I told her that I’m not going to become her sperm donor. I also asked if she’s going to continue with the idea of trying to get pregnant and she flat out said no. Big red flag. 
I got a phone call from her a few minutes ago where she said she loved me and whatnot, so I blocked her number. My girlfriend is pissed at her, understandably. So this is all just unfolding right now… At midnight.

Edit 3: OK, hopefully this is the last edit because for the most part I feel like it’s calming down… Or at least stabilizing. My girlfriend and I both apologized to each other. I explained I was caught off guard and that’s why my reaction wasn’t immediate. She apologized because she thinks she was taking out her frustrations on me when in reality she was frustrated with our “friend.”
Speaking of, the ex friend left some voicemails on my girlfriend’s phone (I blocked her so I didn’t get any) 
The ranged all over the place from crying and begging for forgiveness to racial slurs directed at my girlfriend.... so. That friendship is severed. 

In the comments I mentioned I had a stalker in the past, so I’m not playing any games. I called my godfather who helped me with my first stalker, he’s calling my work and friends/family, just in case they see her coming around. We might stay with him tonight. Just in case, I’m a little paranoid since I lived this before. 

I’d like to thank you guys here on Reddit. This is my first time really opening up about something that I was genuinely confused about and I’ve heard a lot of feedback that open my eyes. I definitely need to work on phrasing of things and be a little bit more quick in my response time, especially when dealing with crazy. Sorry for all the edits in my original post, this blew up so fast and I wanted to make my situation abundantly clear. 
Thanks!

320,"AITA for letting my niece rent my otherwise empty downtown apartment and forcing her to live in a much rougher part of town? Title should be “not let my niece rent.” Sorry mobile typo.

Throwaway. 

So my wife and I own several properties in our state. We live in the suburbs full time but we’ve also got a very large luxury apartment right in the center of our city (one of most expensive in the world). On the market it would be around 4-5k per month to rent. 

Unlike some of our other properties, this apartment isn’t rented out. We stay there from time to time but in all honesty not very often at all. In the past year we’ve probably stayed there for less than 10 weekends total (we try to spend at least 1 weekend there per month). So this is a place that does sit empty for most of the year.

My niece recently got a post grad job in our city. While she was interviewing we offered to have her stay in this apartment while she got used to public transport, etc. She really fell in love with the place. 

Now she’s recently found her first job and really wants to stay in our place. My sister (her mom) wants us to officially lease it to her at drastically reduced rent (around 1.2k, her upper budget) since her argument is we don’t use it much anyways. 

My wife and I declined on the fact that 1) we still want the option of staying there from time to time and 2) having my niece as a legal tenant might cause problems later on. 

However the result is that my niece must now find a much, much cheaper market rate place that will be in a much worse part of town. She’s got some disabilities that prevent her from getting roommates, so the places she can afford by herself are all in very rough neighborhoods. 

My wife and I feel very guilty but also sure we made the right decision, but we recently had dinner with my niece and seeing how much she hates her new place also broke my heart a little. AITA

Edit: adding from comments. Niece stayed rent free for approx ~5 months since she had no income (no job) at the time. She also lives with a large service dog and since my wife is allergic we didn’t go over during that period. But all of this was unofficial, no contract, etc. She was registered with our building as a “guest” for those months and therefore had limited access to some facilities for instance. 

Our relationship with my niece is fine although my sister has been very cold and has told our parents that we’ve been less than helpful. I can understand her frustration (who wants to see their kid in a bad part of town?) but my wife is more angry at her reaction after we said no.","This is one of those situations where just because you're in the right, doesnt mean that you're not an asshole. You have the opportunity to vastly improve the quality of life for your disabled niece and make some extra money but instead you would rather let an apartment sit empty for 90% of the year.

We agreed that I would be getting kinda fucked over, especially because Postmates is a much better platform. (better pay, more flexible, much less technical and logistical issues). We agreed to split both bonuses so each of us would receive $800. The other day we were texting and the bonus came up, conversation went like this.

We have not received invitations yet. My husband just started a new job and will be unable to come to the wedding if it is during the week (not enough pto). I asked my sister if she could move the date to a Saturday so my husband could attend and she refused because Tuesday is the cheapest day to book the venue and they already put a deposit down.

I am a stay at home mom and we have no other childcare so I can't just attend the wedding by myself.

326,"WIBTA By teaching my ex not to look at my reddit account? Hi, this is a throwaway and it’s a long one so strap in. ( TL/DR at the bottom)

Recently a 5 year relationship between me (21M) and my girlfriend ended when she broke up with me a few weeks ago. She borrowed a large sum of money from me during the relationship and, to her credit, has been paying me back week by week. Despite her paying back the money I believe I’m doing the smart thing by not doing anything to piss her of, as we have no written agreement and if she really wanted to could stop paying I could do very little to retrieve my money. As a result of this I took to Reddit to anonymously vent my feelings because I felt frustrated at not being fully able to tell her about it. To be honest it was very cathartic for me and made me feel a little better to have somewhere to put my feelings and get them straight in my head.

Last week after having saved a post under my account before we broke up without my knowing, she looked at my Reddit account and saw the posts, then confronted me about it. This led to an extremely uncomfortable conversation where we really got into about our relationship before I was really ready to talk about it. For context she knew I posted personal stuff there and so intentionally went to look for my personal posts to confront me about them. When I told her this behaviour was out of line and was a huge intentional invasion of my privacy she said “It won’t happen again”.

I feel like I’ve lost the last place to properly vent my private feelings as I don’t trust her to not look at anything I’m posting. So I came up with an idea. To make a fake post with something extreme written in it, nothing nasty or anything that would intentionally hurt her, but something that she would have a strong reaction to and have to confront me about. This would hopefully teach her to stop invading my privacy when she realises the post is fake and her mind bring in to question the real ness of any future posts giving me a bit more freedom to post what I feel.

Friends have encouraged me to do this but I’m a little conflicted and wanted others opinion before either continuing or scrapping this idea altogether.

(TL/DR- WIBTA if I made a fake post on Reddit  that would make my ex call me out so I can’t tell her it’s fake and she’s a fool for stalking my reddit?)","Playing games is a bad idea.

328,"AITA for using the nursing room in the washroom to straighten my hair? A while back, I had some extra time before a social function and stopped by the mall. In my bag, I had a hair straightener and thought I would touch up at bit in the washroom. Unfortunately, there were no outlets and I was going to give up, until I saw an outlet in the nursing room. There was a mom and her baby sitting in one of the couches, breastfeeding. To give context, the room was large with two couches, two toilet stalls, and a mirror with a sink. The outlet was by the mirror and sink, across from the couch. 

I knew she might not feel comfortable with me being in there with her so I peeped in and asked her if she would be okay with me using the outlet for a few minutes to straighten my hair. She said it was fine, though she didn’t look too enthused, and I came inside and thanked her. 

About a minute after, she started giving me the stink-eye and said “You know this isn’t what this room is for right?” I agreed and apologized, saying it was just because I was in a pinch, that I would be done in a few minutes, and that I appreciated her understanding and patience. I also told her I could leave if I was making her uncomfortable. She said it was fine if I stayed, just this once, and continued to look annoyed. I left a few mins after.

They gave me a break on the rent because they liked me and I had the small room.

I obviously thanked her back for all the free content over the years and we had a little chat, at the end of which she told me ""If you're ever interested in something in particular, then I'd be happy to make it happen. This is my pricelist"" and she sent me a copy-pasted message of her services.

The end of the first quarter was last week on Friday. I assigned a test that day and said student got a 75 on it, meaning his grade average should have been in the 60s. But I misread my clipboard and gave him a 95, putting his grade at an 83. 

Today, he asked me after class how his first grade quarter turned out, so I told him it was an 83. He was overjoyed, saying how proud he was of himself. I was confused that his grade was that high but went along with it. 

That’s when I realized I gave him the wrong test grade and that I can still change it with the principle.

After nearly two years of working with the most unethical, miserable collections of sentient chemicals, I filed reports with HR and leadership to try to do something about it. I lost that gamble and things have now gotten exceedingly bad for me. The retaliation is obvious. 


My spouse asked me to wait until I had secured a new job before I resigned. It’s  been several months. I am trying, I’ve got some leads, but nothing official yet.

This morning I was threatened with more torture and dismissal within the next six weeks. I prefer to leave voluntarily, on my own terms, and as soon as possible now due to this new threat. As in, immediately, not with even a week of notice (constructive dismissal).


My spouse got very angry, yelling ensued, followed by us going to separate rooms for several hours. They tried to come back and talk to me, and that consisted of asking me what was so unbearable. They also said they are worried that it might be a significant amount of time before I get something new. Completely valid, but it felt like they were asking me to justify how angry and depressed I am, and that they don’t have faith in my abilities or trust that I’ll do whatever it takes to take care of us. 


As far as I’m concerned, we could be living in our truck and as long we’re together it’ll be fine. The way they are acting makes it seem like their priority is the finances and the stuff, not the well-being of the person they vowed to love for better or worse.


So, am I the asshole for quitting here and now to get away from this harassment without having a new job secured?




EDIT 2: wow people on here are literal. There are no circumstances in this scenario where we would ACTUALLY end up living in the truck. See above edit about savings and support network. The point of that section was to illustrate that we seem to have different priorities: mine being US, because I know that we can make it though anything together, and theirs being not risking the finances (despite the aforementioned savings, etc.).

UPDATE: well, perhaps instaquitting isn’t the answer. I’m taking some personal days for some distance to help me think clearer. I’m probably going to try talking to a higher-up in HR just give it one more shot, then I’ll give two weeks notice. If they decide they don’t want it and tell me to just go, then that’s on them.

357,"AITA for spending valentine's day at the gym instead of with my girlfriend? I am a guy who has a committed workout routine, and I go on the same 5 days a week, and my girlfriend knows this.  I never skip a workout, and the only reason I would ever miss a scheduled workout is if there were some sort of family emergency.

Anyways, my GF and I have been together for 10 months, and this is our first valentine's day together as a couple.  I guess she expected that we'd be spending it together, but when I told her I can't hang out because I have to go to the gym, she got very upset and said that I can afford to miss a day of the gym for this special occasion.  I let her know that the gym is incredibly important to me, and I treat it as a mandatory part of my life that I must do, just like waking up and going to work in the morning.

360,"AitA for calling him ""Monday"" 26M. Back in Highschool I had to move before my Senior year to a small hick Midwest Town where all my cousins went. 

Started Highschool senior year. One week later a kid  a grade below me sat by me and my two cousins & their boyfriends whom I had actually befriended relatively quickly. He started making converation and he was generally super annoying. I didn't like him but I was still nice to him. He continued to sit with us. Over the course of a month he began asking for handouts at Lunch like food and stuff and was always trying to rap. I had turned 18 and he kept asking me to buy him cigarettes to which I refused. 

One day I went to the restroom and came back and my tray was gone. Dude straight ate my food so I decided then I was going to call him Monday since I hated him officially. It caught on but nobody knew why- I didnt tell anyone why that was his name and for the most part nobody asked they just called him Monday. It became his name to the point that Im pretty sure they put it in the Yearbook but I would have to look to double check. Even teachers referred to him as Monday. 

So last quarter rolls around and in Lunch I had a decent sized group of  sitting around and Monday straight out asks me laughingly why I made that his nickname. He hadnt even ever asked before he was just happy to have a nickname. So I told him the truth. ""Everybody hates Monday's."" My friends started laughing their asses off because they couldnt believe I hadnt told anyone that and it was accurate. We didnt like him. He stole food for no reason (always had his own plate) and he was always disrespectfully commenting on my female cousins and was generally mean to girls. The next week he disappeared. Never saw him again.

Until about 6 years later. I had gotten out of the Marine Corps and my wife was finishing school. I went to work at a Prison for only a few months before going into Real Estate and in my ""academy"" class is Monday. He didnt talk much until after the month was over and he heard I had quit.

361,"WIBTA If I don't go to my nephews high school graduation to avoid an ex? So you all get the full picture, I am gonna start from the beginning four years ago. 

I was graduating from a private christian high school, and had just broken up with my girlfriend of two years. Her and I simply didn't have plans for the future that coincided. Plus, I was moving away to go to college where I had gotten a great scholarship in theater, so I ended it even though I really loved her. To this day it was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do. However, during those two years, my girlfriend and I never moved passed kissing (Her choice. She was very religious, me not so much), so I came out of the relationship brokenhearted, sexually frustrated, and a dumb ass.

Then I found a FWB in the theater I was involved with soon after, way too soon after, like three days after. (I know I'm an asshole for not waiting longer.) At first our relationship was fine, having clear rules laid out, but then things changed. I had a sit down with one of the heads of the theater at the college I was headed to and he told me ""Don't go in to theater if you ever want to be able to support a family."", So I decided to go to community college instead and figure out what I wanted to do with my life. When this happened I fell into a really deep depression, and my FWB said she had feelings for me. I said ""fuck it"" my life is a mess anyways why not go for it. 

I'm gonna keep this part as brief as possible. During the year our relationship lasted I was miserable, I was horribly depressed and anxious. I had given up on my dream of a career in theater/acting, and started an addiction to nicotine and alcohol. During the relationship I became extremely dependent, and she was very independent. My emotions were constantly a mess and she had no idea how to handle it. She would constantly make me feel like trash, and I don't even think she meant too. I don't really wanna go to much further into it because I get super anxious just thinking about it.

Anyways we didn't part on good terms, and I got even more depressed and anxious. I started hanging with a really bad crowd and started messing with some things I shouldn't have for about 1-2 years. Then I cleaned up my shit. In the last year and a half, I've gotten healthy, beaten my addictions, picked up MMA, moved on to a state college, I am working on professional film sets and started dating the most amazing weeb in the world. Needless to say I am good now.

Now we get to the point of this whole mess. It turns out my ex's (the bad one) little brother is graduating at the same time as my nephew. There are only about 25 people graduating from their class, so if I go I'm sure to run into her. I know it has been over three years since our break up, but still even the thought of being in the same room as her makes me feel physically ill. However, I know my nephew is gonna be super dissapointed if I don't show up.

369,"WIBTA for reporting an office worker to the dean because she spoke terribly about a coworker? Throwaway because I don’t want anyone who I may know to see this and know my main account.

Today I was waiting to talk to one of my professors, but she was busy so I stood outside her office. My professor’s office is next to another office where this woman, L, is. For some backstory: Over summer I (along with others) worked with a professor, N, for a month. L and N had many issues and L kind of used us as pawns and would be rude to us to get back at N, since she dealt with our hours and pay. N always stood up for us but L did not like that. Anyway, it’s also relevant to note that N has cancer. You’ll see why I said this.

So back to me waiting outside my other professor’s office. L’s door was wide open and she was having an angry convo on the phone. She said she was tired of dealing with someone and that she would tell them off but won’t to avoid problems. However what she said next upset me: “I know people who have Cancer and are going through treatment and they are not THAT annoying.” I thought this was wildly inappropriate and unprofessional. I have no idea if she was talking about N but she has no business talking about someone’s disease with anyone else, especially in a negative light and ESPECIALLY out loud in a public setting during work time. Her office is very central to where many students pass by because all the professors have an office on that floor. I want to also highlight this is a MEDICAL SCHOOL which adds to her ugly remarks being so much worse in that context. I felt very hurt and uncomfortable because no one deserves to be defined by their illness nor badmouthed for it and students should not have to hear staff speaking in such a way. It’s embarrassing for a med school to have staff that heartless and careless imo.

I spoke to classmates that know and were involved in the situation from summer, as well as staff that knew the issues. The staff told me if I felt that strongly to report it to the dean because it was unprofessional and inappropriate. A bunch of my classmates have heard me out and feel disappointed as well. Some encourage me to report but one in particular says it’s too much drama and can be taken as defamation and I should just keep it to myself. I disagree and don’t think it’s right. Even if she doesn’t get fired (which I don’t even want) I think they should reprimand her for being so unprofessional and careless and just heartless.

Historically, each family has bought gifts for every young child that attends the gathering. It is such a joy to watch on Christmas morning as all the kids have the best time unwrapping a ton of gifts. Some gifts are fancy, others are simple dollar-store items, but the kids are over the moon with it all. 

Here’s our dilemma. My wife and I have moved to a different province and are the only ones in our group far enough to require flying with our kids to this event. 

Last year, we did not have enough room in our luggage or budget on top of flights to buy gifts all the little ones, so we attended anyway not expecting to get much for our kids as well. We were wrong, and our kids were absolutely showered with gifts while we had none to give for the others. 

Obviously we felt terrible, but at the same time we also noticed that many of the gifts given by the more distant family were not very personalized  (I really struggled to find a way to say ‘cheap’ nicely) and maybe bought just to check off our kid’s name on their list. Now we instill very deeply into our kids that it’s the thought that counts so we were so grateful that they cared enough to buy our kids gifts, but let’s be honest those gifts were quickly forgotten after we got back home. Btw we had to pay for another check-in luggage to bring the said gifts. 


This year, I want to opt out of the whole gift giving thing. Ideally for us, I would prefer if we bought something I know my kids would love, but say it’s from the rest of the family. Then I would ask the other families to do the same. I don’t know how this will be received by the rest of the group, since this has been a long-ish tradition and would definitely take away a lot of the excitement of waking up to a huge load of presents to open. 

I really don’t want TBTA but I feel like if we want this tradition to continue, this is the only way in order for it not to grow out of control with waste in packaging, wrapping, and money. It already seems that way already. 

Thanks for reading.","Personally I think YWBTA.

Even if you choose not to participate in the gifting, I don't think you should take away your families tradition or their right to buy your kids gifts. Yes its excessive consumerism and the gifts are quickly forgotten but your family only gets together once a year and they want to bring a little joy to your kids. I'd let them have this one thing. If you don't want to take the gifts home drop them at a shelter or thrift store before boarding the plane.",1,YTA,0.0,0.0,0

I recently received an offer to go work in the Middle East. Fundamentally Muslim country, let's put it this way. The project would last around half a year give or take. I am leaning towards taking this offer. 

My girlfriend, who is Jewish, has an issue with this. She flat out told me she would not come visit (this particular country she could travel freely and not even required to dress any different), because 'she would not set foot in a country that doesnt consider her human'. I have no idea where this is coming from all of a sudden. She's not a practicing Jew. She has plenty friends from all backgrounds including Muslim. But she gave me the whole nine yards with 'they don't recognize the state of Israel, they would kick me out for being Jewish, I will not lie about my heritage because you want to go work there, they oppress women there anyway' and so on.

She said this is a hill she would die on. I more so think she doesnt want me gone for half a year. Which is what I told her. She called me an immature asshole. She said I don't understand why she has this particular stance and that I'm being insensitive of her culture.

Admittedly, I’m much better at the game than she is, but she has gotten much, MUCH better over time, and is able to hold her own in most situations.

Anyway, we were playing recently when I was “downed” by some nearby enemies (basically, I got shot, but was still alive crawling on the ground).

They’re right on me.” She responded, “Where?” I replied, “Right on me, just in front of me!” She again replied, “WHERE??” then was was shot and killed by the same players.

Friend 3: completely irrelevant to this story

Here's what happened. My friends and I (4 people including me) recently came back from a trip @ Mammoth Lake. 

Friend 1 drops me off last and while I was unpacking my stuff from the trunk, we realize that one of our friends left his roller in the trunk. (Roller is for to put your back on to relax after working out) Friend 1 tells me to hold onto it so Friend 2 can pick it up from my house, since Friend 2 lives close to me.  I notified Friend 2 that I had it. Next day around 8:00 PM, Friend 2 asks me what time he can pick it up from my house. I told him ""Idk, I'm working right now. At 10 PM maybe, tomorrow would be best since I'm not at work."" and he responds with ""Aight."" Now, forward to 6 hours later around 1:30 AM I am on my computer. Friend 2 sends a text on discord saying ""I'm coming in 20 minutes"" in which I respond ""don't come it's 1 am wtf.""  30 Minutes later, I launch up a game of league of legends rank with friends and I receive a phone call from him saying that he was outside. I told him it's late and he shouldn't be here after I told him not to come but he keeps nagging me to come. Specifically saying ""it'll only take 30 seconds just go out the door and throw it out stop being so lazy."" Again, I am in a league of legends ranked game w/ other friends and I can't just 'leave.' I tell him give me 20 minutes and I'll give it to him. Instead of complying, he keeps demanding me to come out and further insulting me on why I'm so lazy to come out for 30 seconds. I ended the call & when I finished my game (which was less than 20 minutes) it seemed like he already left. Later on he ended up ranting about me being lazy and how it's pathetic on how I can't come out for 30 seconds to give him his stuff.

394,"WIBTA if I expressed concern about my niece's weight? So my (24F) niece (17F) seems to be consistently gaining weight. She lives in another state so I haven't seen her in person for a couple years to be sure, but i see her in video chat and pictures at least once a month, and every time she seems heavier. I don't know her weight or bmi, and I don't know if she knows either. I also wouldn't ask for this information. From looks alone (which can obviously be heavily skewed, especially when you can't see them in person) I think she's at least obese at this point, and still seems to be gaining.

I'm starting to really worry about her physical and mental health. A few years ago she complained about (undiagnosed) binge eating disorder, and I'm not sure if that's still a concern or what her eating habits are like. To my knowledge she hasn't had any health problems at all, but particularly not any due to her weight. Still, i worry there may be undetected health problems or that some may pop up if she continues to gain.

I have other reasons why I think i should probably keep my mouth shut, besides there being no known health concerns. 1, to my knowledge her weight is never discussed unless it's insults from her thin sister. I don't want to create any more insecurities or comparisons there. 2, I've had my own history with eating disorders (Anorexia with some binge/purge) and the last she saw me in person I was very underweight (now I'm a healthy bmi and in treatment, doing much better) so i worry that either she'll see how unhealthy I was and think I'm just a hypocrite or projecting my weight fears on to her or that I may ACTUALLY be projecting my weight fears on to her, or at least overly concerned due to my past.

I don't think I'm exaggerating her size when i see her, and I think my concerns may be valid, but I'm not sure if it's my place to voice these concerns or if it's ever helpful to discuss someone's weight. I've considered talking to her mom instead of going directly to her, but then I feel like I'd just be talking shit behind her back.

395,"AITA for tell my (25f) boyfriend (24m) to drive faster after his 3rd speeding tickets? Babe, if you see this, I love you. I feel like maybe we're both being a little stubborn here and I want a gut check. First time posting here.

Alright, so, Will and I moved to my hometown area in April of last year and since the move he's gotten 3 speeding tickets. The first, last summer, on his way to work. The second, last month on our way home from work (we started working together in the fall). The third just tonight on our way into work. He usually drives us to and from work, our commute is ~45 minutes (mostly highway).

We've had numerous small fights as a result of me giving him driving advice, or in general things I've said in the car. I used to repeat ""we're going to be late, we're going to be late"" whenever we were, obviously, going to be late to work. He told me he didn't like that, I've since stopped. I was the asshole there.

But in the past he has also made me out to be the asshole for more reasonable things, like asking him to slow down sooner at stop signs/stoplights in the snow. I'm from this area, I've driven in the snow more, etc. He's gotten a little better about taking that type of advice, but now I usually opt to drive us whenever it's snowing. We've talked about how I don't like to be vilified for giving driving advice and he's since gotten better at taking my most of my advice. But not always.

His speeding ticket from last month was for going 63 mph in a 35 mph. We had just exited the highway and the ramp is a straight shot, downhill into a business area. The ramp is 2 lanes and can be difficult to slow down, most people coast in at around 50 and gradually slow further into the business area. There were 2 cops posted at a closed gas station, we were pulled over and while Will was being ticketed another car was pulled over, so IMO it was a speed trap. But still, Will could been going slower and was going faster than the general traffic. He was in the left lane passing a car in the right, so he was at the very least going faster than them.

Since then he's started slowing down, a lot, whenever highway speeds change to business speeds. There is another, similar area where the speed changes from 65 to 35 on our route home. It's an even steeper hill and almost nobody slows down to 35 right off the bat. I've told him that he should not brake so hard here, and this is where he will not listen to me. I think it's dangerous and unnecessary to slow down and brake so much in an area where nobody else does. I've told him he should just coast down the hill and just make sure he's not going so fast on once we hit the businesses. He says he doesn't want to get another speeding ticket, what if there was a cop behind him, etc.

His third ticket, that he received tonight (we work 3rd shift), was for driving 82 on the highway in an area that is either 60 or 55 (the speed changes in that area, I can find out for sure if anyway really cares). He was passing another car, this time he was in the right lane and the car he was passing was in the left. He says he doesn't regret passing the car, since the road was going to merge into a single lane and he didn't want to get stuck behind a slow car. Whatever. I think he was going too fast. I don't know that I would have gone up to 82 to pass that car, but maybe that's personal bias.

We're both fast drivers, we both speed a decent amount and we could both benefit from doing it less. He drives us a significant amount more than I do. But I think he's overreacting. On parts of the remaining drive into work he was driving 52 in a 55... I suggested that he'll be fine driving 5-10 mph over on the highway, and it's reasonable that he's gotten speeding tickets for driving 20-30 mph over the speed limit. But somehow I'm The Asshole.

We're agreed that I'll drive us into work more often now, but I don't want to feel like the asshole for telling him he's overreacting and to drive faster in certain scenarios. Like, when it's unnecessary or we're going to be late. It might be worth noting that I am usually ready to leave before he is. We've made steps to wake up and get ready earlier, but slip up now and again. IMO his being ready 3-4 minutes later than me is usually why we are ~5 minutes late to work. Sometimes it's me, sure, but it's usually him.

TL;DR My (25f) boyfriend (24m) has two recent tickets (one for 63 in a 35 the second for 82 in a 55). I think he should find the happy medium and drive 5-10 over the speed limit instead of 20-30 over. He doesn't really think the tickets were his fault. But he also thinks he needs to slow down to the speed limit immediately whenever the speed limit changes and has even started driving under the speed limit.

I just moved into a semi detached property. My only neighbour is this very religious middle aged guy.
We had already realised he was going to be problematic when we were cleaning the place, during the day, and he came over to complain about some noise. Ends up that it was the window blinds rattling against the window because of the wind...
I've always been a night owl and my husband is abroad often, so we usually have to deal with a time difference, which at the moment is 5 hours.
This means I'm awake at night a lot.

Well, clearly my neighbour has taken exception to this and keeps on banging on my wall when I'm simply chatting with my husband. I'm not screaming, but I also can't whisper otherwise he won't hear me. I'm just talking normally. 

Yes, it's late, he has banged on the wall art midnight and at 3 am, but I never had any complains from any neighbours before and as I'm saying, I'm talking normally, not raising my voice at all. 

By now he's making me highly uncomfortable and it isn't that easy to change our patterns. I have no idea how thin the walls are and I don't know what to do. 

I can also be, ermmm, rather loud when I'm having fun, both on camera and when my husband comes home. He has never banged on the walls at those moments, but it's not like I can get off much earlier because otherwise the kids will be awake (eldest is usually asleep like a rock by 11 pm). 

I'm considering telling the neighbour to cut the crap because I'm not doing anything weirdly anti social but I'm a bit afraid of being the asshole. So, aita?

UPDATE - So, I just had a knock at the door and it was the neighbour, who came to have a word about the noise he hears (at 11:30 pm and he just left at 11:45 pm, so as you can see, he isn't an early bird either). 
My husband isn't home yet so it's not like he came because I was talking now, because right now I was quiet. He just wanted to talk about the other nights.

He said he can't hear what I say or anything, he can just realise that people are talking or TV on or something (he confirmed that it isn't loud enough for him to even be able to say what it is, he also didn't know if it was us, the kids, he even asked if I talked in my sleep so clearly it isn't loud at all). 
He apologised for having such sensitive hearing but again reinforced me really likes silence and it bothers him.
He also told me that the previous people were truly awful and there was lots of loud noises at all hours (which I already knew because the neighbours on the other property not attached to ours, already told us).

I told him I understand, and I understand he has been having complete silence for a whole year, but I really am only doing very normal stuff. I try getting any chores done as early as possible, and any talking was done at the same level I was talking to him. In the future if I have TV or music on at night, that's also on low volume. 

I did say that I'm still moving in, so my wardrobe for example is completely empty which may not help, and I'm also looking into suggestions from friends (mainly here actually 🤣) about how reduce the sound. I did also ask if he would consider steps on his side as well, seeing that he is admitting the sound is extremely low but he's more sensitive than normal, I think it's acceptable to ask him to at least consider ear buds or something. 

All in all, we were both friendly, and maybe we can work it out.","YTA.

Last night I called him from 10-11 which I don’t feel is particularly late and I had my headphones in. I’m not aware of being particularly loud and my boyfriend agrees I wasn’t. 

The girl in the room next to me told another house mate that I was being “very loud” even though she had to get up later than me the next day and so it was unlikely she was trying to sleep at this time. The friend who told me said it in a way that I should change it to not annoy her in the future. 

For context, when we first got the house there was a lot of disagreement over rooms. No one wanted the one in the middle including me because I didn’t want to be in between two rooms and have a higher chance of disturbing people. Long story short, we pulled names out of a hat and I got the reject room. 

Because of the fact I got lumped with the room I didn’t want for this exact reason, I don’t feel like I should have to be quiet, especially when it wasn’t even that late. If I was talking any quieter I’d have to whisper. 

The walls are definitely just thin because I’ve heard the person whose room is on the other side talk on the phone and have never mentioned it or been bothered by it because I feel it has to be expected in a student house. 

The girl who said I was being loud has so far not talked to me about it but if she does I don’t think I’m gonna apologise or act like I did anything wrong because I don’t feel I did but I don’t want to create a tense situation if I am in the wrong.

She is the youngest among us(20s). Her social media is full of pictures of cats, video games and cartoon. 

For group bonding I(37F) am usually the one organizing outings and travels, and usually Jan's opinions get passed because it does not go well with majority of us. For example, for traveling she would suggest beaches and amusement parks while most of us prefer shopping centres and sightseeing. As time pass by Jan had stopping giving opinions and just go with the flow.

Whenever we have outings Jan would also be the one carrying our bags as some of us would bring kids along. Despite being nice in general Jan has a rather low tolerance for children, and would visibly back off when the kids start making noise, which some of us, including me, find rude.

Not long ago Jan had an argument with one of the other ladies, Mira(40s). Unlike Mira and most of the other ladies, when Jan snap she started swearing and with a sharp tongue rapped a whole load of curses at Mira. The argument(too long a story) ended with Mira storming off and Jan pointing finger at her.

I called Jan up and had a talk with her. Jan told me that since she's usually a shut-in, she didn't mind joining us for outings as they are the only times she get social, if at all. However, she admitted having a hard time blending into the group as our age and likings differ too much and she couldn't enjoy herself.

455,"AITA for going after a girl who rejected me until the point where the school intervened? So, throwaway for obvious reasons.

This story consists of two people, me, and this girl. I need to get it straight that I loved her _a lot_. Like, I would have married her if we were older and going out. At the time I didn't regret any of this.

So it was the day before Valentine's Day and I plucked up the courage to ask her out. She tells me no but that I'm really sweet and that she's sorry it's how she feels. She also added that if I gave her a few months, ""maybe"" she'd develop feelings for me.

About a month later, I'm still madly in love with this girl and decide to try again. I wrote a song about her and sent it to her,  which she said she really liked so I got more hopeful. I wrote another one (looking back the lyrics are quite cringy) and sent it. She liked it and said no one had said things so nice about her. She was really keeping my hopes up (and we did flirt a bit anyway) but still doesn't like me.

Around another month later I write a letter straight from my heart to her about how I really feel. This letter contains some pretty deep stuff, and I make sure to put it in an envelope and pit ""READ WHEN ALONE"" on it. Her being stupid she opens it and reads it while in a lesson at school when her friends are around her. The rest of the class hear (because she's reading it out loud) and eventually the teacher catches on and goes to one of the heads of year because they're concerned (she actually texted me later saying the letter was sweet but she already knew my feelings for her and didn't need the letter). 

The school then starts an investigation and talk to the girl and she tells them about me asking her out and writing the songs (I think she told them about everything because we had a falling out a few days before). They decide that I've don't something really wrong. They make me go to see a doctor to talk about the situation (or else they'd bring someone in to talk to me). I get a day in insolation (in a room for the whole day in silence doing work) and the news spreads and people gossip about it for the next few months.

Now this friend of mine is great. They accommodated for my awkwardness and even didnt run away when I developed a crush for them. With time the crush faded away and we were able to do things like hang out at parties and joke around, which really helped me develop socially.

Eventually it got to the point when they were going to move away (I had known them for about half a year at this point) so I started to reflect back at our friendship, trying to figure out if we were good enough friends for them to keep in touch, I really didn't want to lose them as a friend due to the distance.

I began to realize that I didnt know that much about them, apart from what had happened over the last few months. I realized that they flaked on most of our plans, even ones they made. I discovered that they would often take party drugs (which I have no problem with) but let everyone know but me. A lot of our conversations were one sided, and would need to be initiated by me. I hardly got texts back, but everything was fine when we would hang out. 

We only hung out together once without being invited as part of a bigger group. I found out that they were talking about the time I had a crush on them with the rest of the friendship group behind my back. I feel betrayed and like I've been made a fool of. 

With my condition, I NEED to trust that people say what they mean, I struggle to read between the lines.

So while I was thinking about all of this, I decided to blank them. I didn't want to say anything I would regret later, and there were feelings I wasn't use to dealing with. This lasted right through the time they moved away, I think the most I said was goodbye.

I decided to text them everything I was feeling in an objective way, hoping that I was being irrational and that they could say something to clear it ul, but I didn't get much from them.

So when we got the full set (over 1000) I trimmed the fat but uploaded 800 to my goggle drive to give my family the freedom to choose which ones they wanted, rather than one stock ""package"" of photos.

Once Marie and I ended things we didn’t talk for several years, up until about 2 years ago, when she reached out seemingly out of the blue. I had been to therapy and worked out a lot of my issues (many of which revolved around my sexuality) and she had to. While catching up we both made amends for what had happened and seemed to move on with our lives. 

Haley knows all of this and was supportive in me getting closure on what was a terrible time in my life. I even showed Haley every message as it came in. At the end of the conversation with Marie Haley said she felt that it was great I got closure but asked me to sever the relationship permanently. I agreed. 

Onto the present: Marie has reached out again maybe about 3 months ago and we have talked every day since. Sometimes it’s about small trivial things and other times it’s about tougher emotional things. Marie was recently there for me about a death in the family- this was a family member she was particularly close to when we were together. At first I told Haley about the conversation and she brushed it off as sort of a do what you want but don’t tell me thing but I could tell it made her uncomfortable. I don’t want to stop talking to Marie and I really consider her to be one of my closest friends at this point, at the same time I don’t want to hurt the trusting and loving relationship I have with my wife. I know it’s somewhat selfish but am I completely in the wrong for wanting to talk to someone who I care about in a completely platonic way?

So Reddit, AITA for continuing to talk to my ex?

468,"AITAH for showing the swear word ""FUCK"" seperately in single letters in class? I am a 10th grade student. Today I caused my teacher to get extremely pissed off and leave the classroom which led to us doing nothing for 45 minutes.

So our teacher planned for the entire class to do an online quiz in Quizizz by joining a Quizizz room. Since there were usernames and there were four of us in our little group of friends, Person A told  Person B about making our usernames F,U,C, and K as a joke. Person B took it seriously and told Person C and I, and we entered our usernames that got immediately noticed by a few classmates. One classmate said ""HA! HA! HA! F.U.C.K."" but the teacher didnt think about it much until a classmate directly informed about it.  Discovering this, the teacher warned whoever the four people are who formed the F word to change their usernames. And we did, however, the only way to change our usernames is by leaving the Quizizz room and join again to make another username, which does not remove the players: F,U,C, and K from the room's player list. about half a minute later, the teacher assumed that we didnt change our usernames and got extremely pissed as if we had no respect towards him. He cancelled the online quiz which the entire class wanted because it's more fun than those paper quizzes.He took a screenshot of the F.U.C.K. usernames (which he later reported to someone with a higher position) and left the room when we still had 45 minutes of class time.  Realizing he left his phone in our classroom, he ordered a student from another section to grab his phone for him and loudly said (as if meant for us to hear) ""I will not enter that class!"" as if just entering the classroom would do any harm.

Update:

As there are quite a few more comments than I had expected I thought it would be nice to give you guys some extra info and an update.


First I wanted to say that me (21f) and my boyfriend (22m) have been together for over a year now. He is the best bf in the world and I love him very much. Both of us have not had any previous relationships, so we still encounter new things regularly and we are still learning.


Secondly, I understand that not everybody likes cum. That’s why I had already flushed my mouth with water before I came back for a kiss. Especially since I know my boyfriend can be quite squeamish sometimes. After this I just felt kind of rejected because the idea of kissing me disgusted him so much.
I asked him after reading the comments if he felt like I pressured him into something he didn’t want to do and I apologized. Pressuring him was definitely not my intention, I would never want to do that to him. He said he didn’t feel that way and that he was sorry too for making me feel rejected.

473,"AITA for Taking My Niece's Keychain?  I've been staying with my older sister and her family. My car key (single) gets lost  often. It just disappears. The young kids take it and leave it somewhere by accident. I don't have any keychains and I can't get one. My time outside of work is limited since I work long hours and bc I'm a busy person. 

For info, my sis and her family moved into a  house, I came with them. My niece and I both stayed in the same room but on different beds. Once she turned 13, her mom told her to go share a room with her aunt. She didn't wanna do this since the room we shared was her room first, she hates her aunt, blah blah.

Her mom made her move in even though she didn't want to, and she also left some stuff in my room bc she had no other space. She was mad towards me bc I had other places to stay but my sis insisted that I stay. The only other place I could go to was in bad condition, so I thought she would understand my situation.

This keychain was included of the objects she left in my room. She got it as a gift. First, I took it from her since I needed it, what was a 13 year old going to do with a keychain? She  found out and started raging. She took it back from me and hid it down in her other things. This was a couple months ago.

A few days ago, I cleaned out my room since it was really messy.  While I was cleaning, I went through her things and threw things out that she didn't need.  Deep in a pouch she had, I found her keychain. I took it. I needed it. I almost lost my key for good, but this keychain would ensure that I wouldn't lose my key, and my car. 

She didn't need it. She left it in my room and did nothing.

Today, I was playing with her sis, and I dangled the keychain in front of her to play. Major mistake. My niece walked in. She saw the keychain and immediately went to grab it. I ran towards the door but she closed it immediately. Her mom, who was also in the room, said that she should let me have it. She said no and she started yelling at me, telling me to give it back. She took it out of my hands. She took the keychain off of my key and threw my key across the room. I told her that it was unfair as I always gave her things, (money, snacks, etc.) but she said that all didn't matter since she always declined them. I then said that at least I'd offered to give her stuff even when she didn't need it, but  when I need something, she doesn't give it to me. 

I left the room and her mom and her started arguing. Her mom was on my side, telling her that I needed it more than she did. My niece made petty remarks.

When my sis's husband got home, she told him everything that my niece did. My BIL started fuming and demanded that she apologized. She said that she wouldn't as she had nothing to apologize for. I told her that she had no manners. Her parents both agreed with me.

Now she won't talk to me and avoids her parents more than usual. She didn't even need or use the keychain. I needed it and I was going to use it. AITA?

So I’m an 18 year old girl who goes to college and I have this little group of friends. this one girl (lets call her T) so we aren’t putting peoples names out there, asks my friend L “ where do you think all of her money goes?” 

Mind you this girl doesn’t pay bills and she doesn’t work so she has no idea what it’s like to be a full time college student and be working too because she doesn’t have a job 

Then she made a comment to L the other day about how I shouldn’t be spending my money on getting my nails done and this and that.  And how she doesn’t know how I can afford all these things because I say I’m “broke”. 

I’m not broke to the point where I don’t have any money I just have to watch what I’m spending. 

L just told me this today because she’s didn’t want to start drama but T basically pushed her to her limits and snapped so L decided to tell me 

I don’t really have a relationship with T but the fact that she is going and talking crap about my financial situations to other people isn’t really any of her business.  She also doesn’t know as much about my back ground as L does, and L is basically her only friend on campus. Her boyfriend is in the military so she really doesn’t have anyone. 

T is the type of person to try to instigate a situation. For an example I texted L one day while she was still in class and T looked over to her and asked her, are you not texting her back because you don’t like her or something? And L just said no I’m just paying attention to the notes. These are the type of people that make me mad because I thought we would be done with the petty bs in high school, guess not

I told L that I wanted to text her and tell her how I felt but L doesn’t want me too because she wants me to confront her in person which is also a good idea.

492,"AITA for correctly guessing all of my sister’s passwords and not telling her Back when we were kids I helped my younger sister set up a Steam account and gave it a throwaway password, think something simple  like “soup100”. A few years later she has a laptop for college and on a whim, I try soup100 and it unlocks her machine. I think it’s hilarious she hasn’t changed it but don’t tell her I know. For the past few years I’ve checked a few times and she still hasn’t changed it. For AITA accuracy, I’ve never snooped into her emails or Facebook or even tried soup100 on those platforms because I have zero interest in getting into her personal life.


Secondly, we used to have a 4-digit shared family PIN (1567 for example) for stuff like the front door code, library card, etc. For a while we both used this pin for our mobile phones and it was understood we both knew each other’s PINs. However we both eventually got phones with 6-digit passcodes and fingerprint sensors so this mutual knowledge was lost.


During high school, I played a sport competitively with the jersey number 55. Years later when my sister played the same sport, she chose 55 too. You get to choose any number so I thought it was weird she ascribed some importance to 55. Around the same time as soup100, I tried 156755 on her phone and nailed it first try. Again, I didn’t want to violate her privacy so I didn’t go past the home screen. WITH ONE EXCEPTION...I registered my fingerprint to set up a prank where I could pretend we had the same print, say something like “genetics is a fickle god”, and have a good laugh.


A few months later, and weeks prior to this, I’ve forgotten about the fingerprint and am showing her a video on her phone when it sleeps due to inactivity, then unlocks due to my thumb resting on the scanner. She freaks out, I’m also shocked because I forgot about it, but then I regain my composure and follow through...here, try your finger on my phone...woah, weird how that doesn’t work...genetics is weird, haha.

My wife and I had our second child only 2 days ago. Our first child (2m) has been with my in laws, and was back at home meeting his new baby sister for the first time.

I decided I wanted to film their first encounter. It was a short video of my wife holding the baby, while our young son sheepishly checked her out. It was a moment that could not be recreated.

I thought it went well, but after watching it back, I realised my step father (64m) had been taking photos. Not only was his shutter noise noticeable several times in the clip, but his phone appears 4 times in the corner of the frame, moving in and out as he got into position . He then posted 2 blurry photos of the encounter to his Facebook page before I had even thought of loading my video.

I have a relatively good relationship with my step father, and he is a good grandfather, but his photography has always been an issue within the family. He has taken some lovey photos over the years, but often at the expense of enjoying the moment. This has only gotten worse since changing to a smart phone in the last 2 years, and now photos are taken whenever he feels like it, and uploaded without any consideration for anyone in them. They are often terrible quality and far too many at one time.

He does not take criticism well, often storming out of rooms, and never apologises. Due to this behaviour, my brothers and I often run issues past our mother. When I told her I was upset with the clip, and my step dads behaviour, she took his side, stating he wasn’t hurting anybody, that the clip was fine, and he can upload as many bad photos to Facebook as he likes. She couldn’t understand why I was upset, saying he was only being a doting grandfather.

Edit

Thank you everyone for the feedback, most was constructive.

Just to answer some questions and address some assumptions. 

I was never concerned about the Facebook privacy issue, and did not plan on sharing the video myself, my social media footprint is not large. The Facebook post was more frustrating because I feel that he is taking photos more and more just so he has more content for his page. The poor photo quality got to me because his interruption of my video didn’t even result in a nice photo, if that makes sense.

A lot of people are saying I’m being petty and he is simply being a caring grandfather. He is definitely a caring grandfather, and perhaps I am being petty. I was just hoping in that moment he could let me take a video without being involved. There is a lot of context that is hard to show in a short description, but 20 years of often intrusive photos paired with his inability to take criticism has been difficult at times. This probably explains why my brothers and wife are on my side but I have been generally labelled the arsehole here.

I agree I could have addressed my frustration better with him. This was probably the result of some recent poor behaviour on his part, which caused me to lash out at the “last straw”. Also doesn’t help that it’s been a stressful and sleepless time with a new baby.

This may seem like I’m making excuses, and maybe I am. But I do agree I should have handled the confrontation better, set up more ground rules, and cut him some slack.","YTA.

509,"AITA for not letting people turn around in my driveway? I live at the very end of a dead end road. A lot of people use my driveway to turn around and go back once they get to the end, and it kind of annoys me. I don’t like 10-15 random people a day using my property to turn around because they messed up their navigation. It wears away the concrete and dirties up my driveway. So, I got a bright orange cone to put at the end of my driveway with a sign that says “Do Not Turn Around in Driveway.” I thought this was a great idea, but my sister saw it one day and called me an asshole for basically giving drivers “no other option.” I told her there are two other houses down at this end of the road, and if they’re fine with people using their driveways, then everyone wins.

I’m living paycheck to paycheck myself and normally can’t afford to be very generous in these situations, however, I notice he has a small, mangy dog beside him. Because I have a soft spot for animals, I decide to give what I can. I roll down my window and gesture for him to come over, right before realizing that I only have $20 bills. Not wanting to turn him away but also not wanting to donate 4 times what I was comfortable with, I politely ask if he’d break my 20. 

He immediately acts very offended and says, “I’m not your bank, b*tch.” Needless to say I drove away without giving him anything.

513,"AITA: my sister and mom refuse to help take care of my dying father I don't know if throwaway accounts are allowed here, but here it goes (TL;DR at bottom):

My father has advanced dementia, bone cancer, prostate cancer, kidney failure, and a broken hip. In June his kidneys failed, so he had to be taken to the emergency room for this. He has had other problems (dementia and prostate and bone cancer) for a few years now, but we have been able to learn how to manage them. During this time, he lived at home with my mom as the main caretaker. When his kidneys failed in June, it had gotten so bad that he had to be moved to a nursing home because my mom would no longer be able to manage. The nursing home he was in initially wasn't very good. It was actually the place where he broke his hip. Because of the broken hip, he had to go back to the hospital. Once he got the hip surgery, the hospital wanted to send him back to the very nursing home where he broke his hip, but we demanded that he stay at the hospital. We just can't trust that nursing home anymore. The hospital did let him stay, but because there are only so many staff at the hospital, he spends a lot of time alone in his room, watching the clock. My dad can't stand being alone with nobody to talk to, so he needs to have someone to be with him to be happy or else he will try to escape. He also needs a lot of help with tasks like eating, because he will refuse his meals if someone isn't sitting by him to make sure he is eating. These are things the hospital staff cannot provide, so we (his family) have to help out. I am a stay at home homeschooling mom with young kids (7 and 4), so this means that I can spend more time with him. Me and my mom alternate mornings and afternoons, while my sister (a full-time insurance broker) does the evenings. 

My sister isn't too happy about this. She really would rather spend her evenings doing leisure activities. She thinks that my efforts to help my dad are stupid and that she shouldn't have to help him. Recently, she also convinced my mom that helping him is stupid as well and that she shouldn't have to do this. Before this, my mom was totally cooperative and understood that she should be helping him. When she began refusing to help, she also cut off all communication with me. Our family is falling apart at the seams now, while my dad is not getting the care he should be getting. 

TL;DR My dying father, who needs a lot of help and care from our family, is not getting the care and help he should be getting because my sister and mom refuse to do their part in helping. 

Am I in the wrong here? Am I responsible for this rupture in my family?","YTA. Mostly for forcing impracticality on your other family members without looking at alternatives. Depending on your dad's prognosis, this is not feasible in the mid-to-long-term.

What you're describing is a situation where your dad is in hospital and you family is still doing round-the-clock care. That's just not reasonable or sustainable. What it also means is you probably aren't educating your kids to the fullest extent, your mom may have the most time of all of you, but your sister has absolutely no time to herself to get away from working or being a caregiver.

Your dad needs constant care. I get that you dislike this particular nursing home, but consider that your father was likely a high fall risk and could have broken his hip anywhere, including under your care or at any nursing home. Look for a different nursing home, or visit frequently at the prior nursing home. But look for alternatives here.

516,"AITA for feeling upset that my girlfriend is more impacted over Stan Lee's death than my father's death. I know that I am the asshole because I blew up on her about it when I should have been calm and should have stepped away from the issue. Don't judge me on that, because I could not have helped that part, but I still need insight on why it's wrong/right for me to feel this way.

I have known my girlfriend (20F) for four years, but we have only been dating for one year. She met my parents a couple of times, and we had a trip last Christmas break where she stayed in a hotel with me and my parents. It was a good time all around.

Half a year ago, my dad passed away. It was expected, but it still hit me and my mom hard. My girlfriend reacted to the news with shock when I told her. She was there for me when I was really struck by grief, but ultimately, she was over it just about the instant she heard it. I chalked it up to her not having known him all her life, but today, it really made me feel... aggravated.

A couple of hours ago, Stan Lee died and news got around. (May he rest in peace.) The moment my girlfriend heard, she broke down--crying in a way that I have never seen her cry. She was so mortified by this, and I sat down with her, reminded of the day that my father died and the way that I broke down. She started talking about Spiderman, her favorite comic book series. Stuff like how she couldn't believe that such a good man died and how she was going to miss seeing his cameos.

And for some reason, I couldn't help but wonder why she never said anything like this when my father died. Sure, she was there for me, but all she did was listen and tell me ""I don't know what to say..."" every time I talked to her about my memories. At the time, I accepted this.

Stan Lee is a media legend, sure, but she didn't even know him. My dad was someone that she sat down and ate dinner with. My dad was someone that she met, and she couldn't spare any tears for him. I was very upset. I told her these things, yelling when I said it. She stopped crying and looked shocked--and even in the moment, I knew that I shouldn't have exploded like that. We decided that we will talk about this tomorrow.

Look. Roast me. Tear into me. I feel very strongly about this, but I know that I might be in the wrong. I want you to tell me why I'm wrong so that I can gain perspective on this.

&#x200B;

EDIT:

I took into a consideration a lot of the comments, but probably won't have the time or the emotional capacity to respond to all of them.

There are a lot of you that showed incredible empathy during this time, and some of you that showed none at all. I wanted to say thank you to those of you that offered your condolences, even though you didn't have to.

I really do admit that I'm the asshole for blowing up at her and for not being there for her during a tender moment, like she had been there for me. I recognized that she was also mourning, but the asshole in me was upset that she was mourning over someone that she had never met, whereas I would always carry the wound of my father not being there. Anyway, that's all just filler to explain that I stopped to think about why I felt the way I did.

Earlier, I stopped by her house with McDonalds (thanks to the guy who told me to bring her favorite food) and she sat down with me to talk about it. We always talk through our issues, but this was the first time that I have ever been emotional in a way that I knew was wrong, but couldn't stop myself from feeling that way.

I apologized to her and she squirted ketchup on my kneecap as ""payback."" (Sounds weird, but she was just being playful.)

She told me that she understood that my father's death was still a fresh thing and that she could understand where my anger was coming from, but that I was in the wrong for having blown up about it. She would have preferred that I had stated how I was feeling calmly, even if the way that I felt wasn't right to begin with. She told me that it wasn't okay, but she forgave me, asked for a ""get out of jail free"" card if she ever got upset about something she couldn't help feeling upset about.

I know I'm super lucky to have met someone who will talk me through anything.

Like some of you said, she told me that for her, she was upset that Stan Lee was someone that she had never known, but whose work she will always carry close to her heart. She has always been invested in fandom/geeky things, so I can get that, even if I might never experience it. She told me that she mourned for my dad too, that she always appreciated the things that my family has done with and for her, but that she felt that the last thing I needed while mourning was for her to cry too, that she wanted to be my rock at the time. She made some cool metaphor about rocks and rivers, but I forgot what it was.

But ultimately, I wanted to thank some of you guys in the thread. Some of you phrased it very aptly, in a way that really made me understand why I was in the wrong. Her grief is separate from mine, and I have no right to police it. Though it hurt to talk through and to admit I was in the wrong, I am glad I talked to her about it.

523,"AITA For finding something I love while my husband is miserable? I'm using a throwaway account because I've promised not to publicize any personal struggles, but I'm in a lot of pain right now and I just have to know ... Am I the A-Hole here? My husband is in a job that overwhelms him, sandwiched in a commute from Hell. To make things worse, I have Dysautonomia, a chronic illness that leaves me unable to work or do all but a pathetic amount of housework. This leaves him to cook dinner every night, and our house is a mess of embarrassing proportions. 

I've often taken to social media as a way to fight boredom and feel a little less isolated. I only get out of the house maybe 2-3 times a week. I feel guilty about it a lot, sitting around unable to do anything while he's buried under so much stress. This may be a good time to point out that he has type 2 diabetes so he's not in great health either.

Lately I took the plunge and started actually making content. I can just put makeup on and do a video in bed. Extra bonus is that, thanks to said makeup and decent editing, I don't even look that sick. This makes me happy and I've even graduated to making videos at my desk.

Here's the problem: I still feel guilty. And my husband is rapidly resenting the fact that while he's cooking dinner, I've just posted a video. When he's cleaning the kitchen, I'm going live with the kids playing in the room. I have the kids help my husband where they can, and I do my best to balance my time. I'm there for my kids at the drop of a hat, whether I'm in the middle of a live stream or half way in or out of makeup. I don't let this take away from anything I give our kids. I just can't do much for HIM. I can't help him in his job. I can't make his commute easier. I can't hold a job myself and make more money for the family. I'm there to listen to him vent and help him with minor computer issues, but I can't provide any solid relief for him. I'm just sitting here making videos.

He now says that he feels that if I didn't waste my energy on my phone, that I'd be able to help him more. I can't convince him otherwise, even though I couldn't do any of that before. I know he's miserable, and I don't want him to be jealous, but I literally can't stand not doing anything with my time. AITA?

Edit:
It's been so painful reading these comments. So many well intentioned comment suggesting wheelchairs and mealprep ... I literally don't have it in me to sit and chop and peel stuff most days. And when I have anything at all I give it all to trying to catch up, but it's nowhere near enough. My doctors have come to the final suggestion that I just accept my level of not functioning, but I can't when I have kids that need me and my husband resents me so much.

2nd edit:
Also, I do my best to connect with him and support him emotionally. I said earlier that I listen to him vent, but I can't solve his problems and that makes him mad at me for being useless.

I've also reached out to vocational rehabilitation to try to find a job that I can do, and I literally stumped my worker. We couldn't find anything.

I’ve known him for over a year and they’ve been there pretty much that whole time. It’s nothing crazy, there’s only about 5 or 6, but they are pretty big and noticeable and very obviously blackheads that can easily be extracted.

For a bit of backstory, I've known both of my friends (who I'll call A and K) for a little over 5 years, and A and K have been dating for a little over a year now. I'm not super close with K, but we're pretty friendly, but A is one of my best friends, and as someone who doesn't have a great support system at home, I love his parents too and feel very comfortable being around his family and just generally being me, and they love me, but they're not very fond of K. I also lost my phone about 2 months ago, after my parents found out I was trans and that I was talking to some friends I'd made online through classes and an online gaming community, who were very supportive and accepting. K and A have known I'm trans for as long as they've been dating.

Last Friday, I asked K what days A was free, because I wanted to hang out over Christmas break, maybe play games on the new Switches we were hoping to get. She got offended and told me she wasn't comfortable with me hanging out with him without her present. I sort of brushed it off, and when I got home, I asked my mother if she would text his dad, so that we could work out that we can hang out next Friday (today.) I made an overbearing girlfriend joke to her about K being touchy about us hanging out, and then just went back to doing my normal shit. Today rolls around, I go over, we have a blast. I drive us to Subway (our favorite fast food place) and we get subs for us and his sister and we play video games (we got the Switches, haha) and Monopoly, and watched comedy videos. Same thing we always do when we hang out, except I actually won at Monopoly today.

I told her she was being controlling by making such a huge deal out of it. It spiralled out of control from there. She said that I'm not her friend, for not respecting her opinion, and I snapped and told her I didn't, because it was a stupid-ass, baseless decision. I asked her if she would care if his friend Evan had come over to hang out instead, and she admitted she would be, and I asked her what was different, and she said that it was offensive to her to ""find out that instead he’s just hanging out with another girl"" and I got really mad at her. I told her that it was bullshit that he can't hang out with another girl, but worse, I'm not even a girl. He's straight as a ruler, I'm a guy, AND I have a boyfriend. She said ""I will always remember you as a girl I grew up not believing in transgender unless they have the part of a guy.

531,"AITA For not staying home with my fiance after she got her tooth pulled? My fiance has had some recent issues with her teeth and is needing to have some of then pulled. Today she had an appointment to have the first one pulled and has been pretty anxious about it.

This morning I drove with her to the dentist to offer what support I could and then drove her home after the deed was done. The drive home,  she had seemed pretty upbeat, definitely more then before she went in.

Once we got home I took her stuff inside but left mine in the car because I had work and was going to go into the office (I have the flexibility to work from home but I find it very unproductive because home is for relaxing and I have a hard time switching that off).

Originally my fiance thought I had forgotten my stuff in the car and made a joke about it. When I corrected her she got very mad at me, saying she couldn't believe I would leave her at home by herself after what she went through and that she was shocked that I didnt even tell her I was planning to.

This lead to a bit of a fight which ended up with her going into another room upstairs telling me to leave and she would look after herself and me leaving to work.

I just dont see having a tooth pulled as something needing to have someone take care of you. And I would love to stay home with her and pamper her but Im current in a stressful situation at work with deadlines and a pending job change. She knows this and knows that I hate working from home but she never asked me to work from home, she had thought so full heartedly that I would just be doing it because it is the thing to do.

Now things are pretty stressful between us, with her saying that she doesn't feel as much like she can rely on me to be there for her when she needs it. And still cant understand how I could just go to work while she was in pain.

AITA? Should I have stayed home?

Edit: Since it is something people are asking for, the tooth itself was one of the four upper front teeth. It had fallen apart previously and the dentist at the time said they believe it was due to an old bracer bracket that had been there for some time and only recently removed.

L = My brother.

B = Our mutual friend who leave the note with us.

M = Our mutual friend who are depressed and paranoiad.

They would be sweet, but too sweet, trying to makes us choosing to hang out with them more then the other. We refused because, it seem very unhealthy for us. M became to repand rumour against us, saying we were incestuous and boring. And B was cheating of him with us. The gossip became very big at the point our friends came to us for asking if it was true. We tried many times to talk with M, but M became very on the defensive and accusing us to lying.

&#x200B;

B became very close of us during the times, she made us decline hangover with friends to stay with her. But my brother was Ok with it. I became more and more suspicious, because i thought, she was trying to convince us to take her back against M. I managed to make apologies M and fixed thing up.

So me (20M) and my ex Gf (20F) were dating for a year and a half before we mutually ended it because we knew we weren’t right for each other. We stayed as friends and didn’t have any issues. One day we caught up and ended up having some amazing sex and realised that while we weren’t compatible as a couple we still were physically attracted to each other.

So every few weeks at parties or when we caught up we would have a bit of fun. We both are careful not to let emotions get in the way and also to be very respectful of each other. We are both also hooking up with other people but out of mentioned respect we are careful not to tell each other about our sex lives to not complicate things further.

The issue arouse last night when she was send me some ‘fun’ pictures and I noticed some marks on her body, I tried to ignore them but it was bugging me a bit so I asked what they were and she kind of deflected the question which made me feel pretty confident I knew what they were. After some pressing she admitted that they were love bites and sex marks.

Now I didn’t get annoyed that she was sleeping with other people, I am too. I was more annoyed that she kind of showed it off to me. I go to some pretty solid lengths to make 100% sure she doesn’t find out about any thing I do so I felt pretty disrespected that she doesn’t pay me the same courtesy.

I played it off a bit and just reminded her that she should be more careful about keep her sex life private from me. I was expecting a quick apology then we can move on but instead she got defensive saying that I shouldn’t want to see sexy pictures if I wasn’t prepared to see the marks of other guys and that she knows I sleep with other people so it shouldn’t matter that I know.

538,"AITA for yelling at this girl to leave my party immediately? I am a 21 year old male college student who was hosting a house party along with my 8 other male roommates. Our house is an absolute hellhole and has been miserably trashed in the past (and we don't do a good job of maintaining it). The bathroom on the ground level is the one we open up to partygoers, but we try to keep the upstairs bathroom off-limits since we prefer our own private bathroom to be untouched.


During the party, someone spilled a bucket of blue wall paint. A 21 year old girl slipped and fell on the paint. She got a decent amount of paint on her leg as well as a mild bruise.


The line to the ground floor bathroom is always very long at parties (maybe 8 people), so she decided to just go upstairs to use the private bathroom. I was upstairs at the time and I noticed her using the bathroom to wash her feet in my sink.


I didn't want my sink (i.e. where I brush my teeth) to be used for someone to wash their feet, so I asked if she could just wait in line downstairs. She became upset and sarcastically said ""Oh, I see how it is, fine, be the way.""


At this point I was ticked off because I thought my request was very reasonable, so I said ""Just get the fuck out of my house.""

546,"AITA for not wanting to turn the heat up more? So some backstory is I’m a broke college student in a pretty cold part of Washington. When I walk to class in the morning it can be like 15 degrees! But also I’m super broke and pay for everything myself and so do two out of my three roommates. 

We often keep our house at 60 degrees at night time and when none of us are at home. And then  65 to 70 degrees depending on how cold it is outside. 

So one of my roommates has a condition where her blood doesn’t circulate very well which I guess makes it very hard for her to retain heat as well! This is this basis of why she always is cold. She often remarks that our house is cold and that she can’t get warm and the rest roommates agree and say things along the lines of “yeah that’s why I have a heated blanket” or “yeah but heat is expensive”. 

Her frustration came to head last night when she was getting ready to go out for the night and was ignoring all of us. So we all asked her what was wrong until she finally said she is annoying with how cold it is and how she called her mom and her mom said she is very upset with us because we keep it so cold in the house. A roommate and I tried to explain that we can’t afford high utilities because we pay for it ourselves and that she should get a heated blanket or a space heater. She then said those were too expensive and we just need to turn up the heat. We then explained that high utilities are also expensive and that again we cannot afford it.

With a lot more back and forth she finally brought up her blood condition and said since she has that we need to turn the heat up for her. At that point I just said I’m sorry and walked away just not knowing what else to say. 

All day today she has been pretty cold and passive with me and the other roommates. I want to have a roommate meeting but also don’t know what else to say.

And I live in an area that regularly sees -30°F... I know something about dealing with the cold. 

She’s right— heated blankets and space heaters are expensive, and actually fairly dangerous. They can pretty easily start a fire, especially if they’re accidentally left on, and they often will cost more in electricity use with prolonged use than if you had just turned up the heat. 

There are things you all could research to help a house retain heat and save money on energy. Covering the windows with old blankets or buying a plastic wrap will seal the windows from a draft, helping retain heat. Putting old blankets on the bottom of exterior doors is also a big help. Closing doors to rooms that you don’t use often, and shutting off vents to those rooms will direct more if the air flow to the rooms you are occupying, if you have forced air.  But none of you are actually interested in helping her— you sound like you only really care about the impact to you. 

I also wonder what the real difference in the heat bill would be if you did turn it up... if the difference in cost is like, an extra $20-$30, yeah, you guys are definitely being assholes. Did you research the cost difference before you made up your mind?",1,YTA,0.0,0.0,1
547,"AITA for letting a one night stand believe I'm a lesbian? Background info: I'm bisexual and my friend Summer is a lesbian. Summer's gorgeous and gets hit on a lot by guys shooting their shot.  She's had some bad experiences with guys who want to turn a lesbian that she's still  bitter about.

So a few days ago I was at this business conference in another city and I got friendly with a guy there. We were people watching during lunch and I joked ""I'm so gay!"" when several gorgeous girls walked by in a row.

Later that evening we were hanging out again after the conference ended and went to his hotel room. At one point we were making out and he said something like he'd always wanted to convert a lesbian. I'm actually bisexual and just use ""gay"" as an umbrella term (this is common) but I didn't feel like getting into that and explaining it all so I just stayed silent and let him think what he wanted since it was just a one night stand and we'd never meet again. If this had been an actual date I would have explained.

The next day I got home and was chatting to Summer on the phone and told her what happened because I thought she'd think it was funny. She said ""Wow, no wonder so many guys tell me they can turn me straight if girls like you are just lying to them like that.""

I figured she was joking so I laughed and then realized she was dead serious. I began explaining it was a ONS and I don't think I have an obligation to tell some guy I'll never see again my entire life story just so lesbians don't get offended.

Uc was talking about how “I wasn’t good” and “ I should do girly things” I replied telling her to “Stop it” and she was not happy. I don’t remember all of the details as I was young and it was a long time ago but this one quote sticks out like a sore thumb in my head. Uc says “Well those bats only have air in them but this bubble wand has soap that we can pour in your eyes”. My little autistic self had no idea that she was just trying to look tough and she would never actually do that so I ran inside, grabbed the first thing I could find, a pitcher of ice water and poured on her head. She went screaming and crying to her Mom. My Mom and I had to sit in the car while I was lectured on why I shouldn’t have done that and we didn’t go to any family events for several years.

When my friends and I go out, I’m usually the one who purchases the ticket/food and Venmo charge request them. Beginning this year, we’ve been going to the movies almost every other week so I’ve also been the one ordering the tickets online. 

For awhile now, I’ve been using an app to purchase discounted gift cards to use whenever I make purchases online. Sometimes there’s a really good sale where it’s x% amount off certain gift cards so I tend to stock up on places I know I’ll be using. The movie site is no exception and I was able to score gift cards for 15-20% off their market value. 

So my dilemma is whether or not I should Venmo charge my friends the discounted value or face value. I wouldn’t mind doing the discounted value but it can be bit of a hassle since sometimes I’m paying with multiple gift cards which I’ve acquired at varying discounts. 

Edit for additional info; 

For example, I used 3 separate gift cards for our last movie outing. The gift cards varied in value AND discount from 13.3%, 15%, and 10.9%. So just calculating the “true” value of each ticket is more of a hassle than splitting the value evenly. If I knew the discount was an even 20% off, I would have no problem charging them less.

558,"AITA for wanting to throw a get together? Context - me and my Girlfriend have been going out for five years, living together for four.

My girlfriend does not like having people around she doesn't know. Our house is her safe space. I have friends I have known for years that are not allowed, even when she's out, because she doesn't like them or know them well enough. There's one specific friend who is always around, and it's a bit of a coincidence that this friend is one of my girlfriend's crushes. 

I'm a fairly social person when i trust the people, and after a series of mental health episodes and self confidence issues, i finally feel comfortable enough to expand my friendship circle and get to know new people. So after being on a course for a few months, i've got to know a few of the other idiots, and found they are all pretty sound enough for a night out. 

We've been out once before and they've bought alcohol to drink because it's cheaper, but had nowhere to drink it. As such, they've got drunk on street corners. Terribly unsafe. 

I would love to host them in mine and my girlfriends flat for a few hours of safe predrinking and card games before going dancing, but she objects. 

All of these people are aged between 18 and 23. I'm 25. My girl is 30, and in theory would either not be involved or would be out of the house to visit a friend of hers. 

Her argument is that she is uncomfortable with people she doesn't know being in her house, and as such doesn't want people around. 

I tried to counter point that there is a large aspect of my life, and many friends i've made, that she hasn't met. I then asked if she would like to meet those people in a situation outside our house, and she said no. 

She says that she's not saying no one is ever allowed to come around, and tried to make a point that she shouldn't have to say yes to every random stranger I want in the house. 

Apart from an incident a few weeks ago in which two of the people from my course needed a place to crash for the night, and stopovers and visits involving the pre-approved friend, I have never had many people round. In four years, the amount is in single digits. I admit i'm a selfish manipulative butthole a lot, but i've also made sacrifices for her. My girl's ruling put a lot of strain on the friendship with one of my best friends. I've had two seperate 6 month long job searching episodes where my mental health went down the toilet and I could have really used some friendships in a familiar environment. 

She shut down the discussion and sent me to bed to sleep. I tried to calmly continue the conversation but she shut it down again. 

My life is getting better. I want to gain independence and freedom to have friends around to drink safely before going dancing. AITA?

566,"AITA For asking friends to pay for an AIRBNB even if they are not sleeping over the full night? I rented out an AIRBNB for a friends birthday surprise get together with friends.  Due to this the AIRBNB is a big house and can fit several people to spend the night. To help cover the fees I asked everyone to pay even if they are not sleeping over.

Now, everyone was okay with helping to pitch in since we all make similar pay and understand where we are coming from. Yet, it wasn’t until recently that a couple thought it was wrong to charge them since they weren’t spending the night and are only visiting for the get together.
The couple mentioned that since they are bring alcohol and some goodies for the birthday friend that it should be more than enough on their part and charging them wouldn’t be ideal.

To put out some numbers: I was charging everyone sleeping over or not to pay $30 per person.

I was going to drop the rate for them for $30 buck for both of them, but they are now going around asking the other people if they are going to pay me and I’m not sure where to stand on this issue anymore.

Thoughts and advice welcomed!

EDIT: so taking in what everyone has mentioned what I ended up doing was re-communicating to my group and I funded $200 of the Airbnb so it was less pressure for my friends that are visiting to pay in. The Airbnb was $550 and with myself putting in 200 and with 13 guest sleeping I decided to not raise the price for the guys that are sleeping over therefore there are still $80 to cover on the Airbnb and I decided to make it donation based from the guest who are not sleeping over. So far the friends who are financially able want to send over all the money to cover the 80 bucks but I’m capping it for a donation for $20 max.

All in all at the end of this everyone is happy with the outcome and with the refocus that this is for a friend and understanding my financial budget or everyone’s financial budget really those that want to donate will donate financial cash in those I will donate in other ways will do.

It really can take a village to fund a surprise party for a friend!

571,"AITA for ending my friendship with one of my best friends?  

For a little context before the story, my friend was the person I always talked with about dating and relationship topics. We've been good friends for a few years up until last night (Saturday).

Recently I had been talking to him about a girl I had been talking to and met up with a few times, she and I go to the same gym and she's stayed over once. I was talking to him about how I really liked her but I had my doubts if she was looking for something serious.

One night she messages me that shes out clubbing near the same part we were. I said sure, and my friend and I go to meet her group, he told me before we went in that he wants tonight to be a good night for me and her.

What happens next is as soon as I introduce him to her he immediately starts flirting with her and she starts flirting back. It was the most absurd change of events I've ever seen in my life. One moment I'm about to meet up with my dream girl and literally 20 minutes later they're off in their own corner giggling and sharing drinks.

I ended up leaving just from how embarrassing it was and messaged him the next day saying I was really upset that he completely humiliated me and for being a bad friend since I had been telling him for weeks that I liked this girl. Just for added context, this guy is very good looking, has always done really well with women, is currently seeing someone and was quite drunk that night, we all were.

When I told him how I felt he apologised profusely saying he doesn't remember what happened, that he's not interested in her and that he's so sorry for everything.

Well they're friends on Facebook now and follow each other on IG. AND after talking to him more for a few minutes he told me that they matched on tinder months ago but he never ended up messaging her. The fact they matched previously has never been brought up for the weeks that I've been talking to him about her. I'm certain that they're going to stay in touch even though he said hes not interested.

After talking for maybe 20-30 minutes we got to the point where I said to him that I can't simply look past this, everything that happened seems like a major friendship red flag, now I hate you and I don't want to talk to you again. To which he responded by suggesting that I'm overreacting, it's not that big a deal and saying ""I don't want to lose you as a friend for something so stupid"". I've since cut all contact with him, we have the same social circle in which he's closer to everyone in and I'll have to distance myself from them too.

So am I the asshole for ending my friendship with him? To clarify, I'm not really too upset with the girl, I think it's shitty that I got ditched so coldly but hey we only hung out a few times previously, and she did hint to me that she isn't looking for something serious.

TLDR: Close friend cucks me out of my date, now I'm salty and am being told I'm overreacting.","YTA. 

By the way your friend talked and acted, it's clear that he was just a bit too drunk when this happened. He profusely apologized to you afterwards, and admitted his mistake. Not to mention the fact he's already seeing someone, so the chances that he'd try to pursue your dream girl seem very slim.

Him and the girl adding each other on social media does not mean they're going to hook up or anything, and quite the contrary, he could even help you out as a wingman, since he'd have some knowledge of what she likes/dislikes.

572,"AITA for asking my SO/fiancee to make our roommate move out? This is a long story. Thanks in advance for reading!

Backstory: my SO (31F) and I (28M) started dating when I was living in my own place. At the time, she lived at home with her mom and her mom's best friend who is a 60+ year old man. Her mom passed away suddenly less than a year after we started dating and I moved in with her for emotional support and to help sort out the estate. This was over 3 years ago and we are now engaged.

At the time I moved in, the understanding was that we would get the estate figured out and then sell the house to get our own place. Her roommate wasn't paying her mom rent at the time she passed away, and it certainly didn't seem fair to demand it immediately following the upheaval caused by her death. He was basically a model roommate and most of the house's decorations were his. He cleaned regularly despite having a full-time job, and purchased communal groceries. I hardly knew my SO's mom at the time she passed, so I was happy to have her mom's best friend there to console my SO as a sort of ""uncle"". This was about 3.5 years ago.

It took almost a year to settle the estate, and my SO would constantly stress out about how much the mortgage payments were since her mom had been making more than both of us combined. We let our roommate know that we were starting to look at houses and he began to pack and consolidate his things. We work together and our office had massive layoffs which impacted me, so we couldn't continue thinking about taking out a brand new mortgage even after the estate had been sorted. I told her that we needed to start charging our roommate rent since the agreement for him to live here for free was made by her mother, not her or I, and our income was insufficient -- even the bank said so. She reluctantly agreed and he started paying fair rent, but stopped cleaning the house (except for his own messes) and started buying his own groceries. With the additional rental income it became easier for us to manage the existing mortgage, so we started trying to make the house our own instead of getting it ready to sell. This was about two years ago.

Our roommate has since retired and spends most of his time in his room, and I only see him about once a day. I'll hear my SO complain about him leaving coffee grounds on the counter, or letting the dog come upstairs (she pees on the carpet every chance she gets), or cluttering up the fridge. Over time, my subtle hints that maybe we should persuade him to leave started to be met with resistance. It was less ""let's see what his plans are"" and more ""I'm not going to have that conversation with him and you need to make up for the difference in rent"". I stopped pushing the issue and figured that after we were engaged he would get the message and see himself out. We've been engaged for over a year now and he has shown no signs of leaving, and has even started accruing knick-knacks/antiques again after selling or packing most of his stuff when we were still looking to move.

The other day I cracked -- I slipped down the stairs when our cat ran between my legs as I was going to feed him, causing me to slide into the dog gate, injuring me and requiring us to buy a new gate. In my mind, I slipped because our roommate has been contributing to my cat's bad meal time behavior by allowing him to steal food from the dog (he tried to emphasize several times that it was just a little, and continued to mention it looking for some kind of approval from me, which I was not giving because I'm trying to train this cat), and I slammed into the gate which was only there because he lets the dog come upstairs and doesn't watch her so she ruins the carpet. Obviously this isn't entirely logical, but at that moment I lost my temper and everything I had been internalizing came out at once and I felt like a crazy person.

This led to a surprisingly productive conversation regarding my feelings that I could not control for some of these issues we commonly quarrel over because they were in some way related to our roommate -- things like housecleaning, our sex life (his room shares a wall), and pet training. I explained that I want to know what our life would be like if just the two of us were responsible for everything that occurs under our roof, while at the same time saying that I obviously don't blame our roommate for all of our problems and don't expect him moving out to solve everything either. I assume he doesn't want to leave or he would have already, and she doesn't *really* want him to leave, but I do. She agreed that I had made plenty of concessions over the course of our relationship and that she would talk to him by the end of the month.

Now that she's agreed to talk to him, I feel like an asshole. I don't know for sure whether I'll be able to train the pets without his interference, or if our sex lives will dramatically improve -- I just don't see any other way of finding out with him still living here. I know that I'm putting us at a financial disadvantage (we both make more now so it's nothing we can't handle, but $ is $) based only on my desire to be truly alone with my future wife. I don't feel like it's my place to broach the subject to him since he was invited by my SO's mother, and my SO lived with him for years before I moved in...so I put the burden on her despite her not being the one who wants him to leave.

I get your reasoning. It makes sense, but it doesn't take into account how that fact would impact your GF's feelings. You're only considering your own feelings. 

Would making Uncle leave please your GF at all? Will she feel like she's disrespecting her mother? Will it feel like kicking out a father figure?

579,"AITA for telling my best friends GF he will never propose? 
My best friend Michael (28M) has been with his girlfriend Johanna (29F) for 11 years since highschool. I (28M) recently proposed to my fiancée Lily (26F) and we've been together for just shy of 3 years. 

Earlier this week Johanna mentioned to me and Lily at a party how she can't wait for Michael to propose to her and how she can't wait to have her fairytale wedding. 

I, admittedly, laughed and told Johanna that after 11 years together if a guy hasn't proposed to you yet he probably never will.   I was also a little shocked because up until that point I thought both Michael and Johanna were on the same page and didn't believe in marriage (I know for a fact that Michael doesn't want to tie the knot but I didn't mention that to Johanna). 

Johanna got defensive and started arguing that a lot of couples wait a long time before marriage and not everyone rushes into marriage like us. I just sort of reiterated my point that 11 years is longer than average and I wouldn't be surprised if Michael never proposes. I also told Johanna straight up if she wants a proposal in the future she should probably have a serious conversation with Michael about it. 

Well, on the uber ride back home my fiancée Lily was horrified with what I'd said to Johanna. She doesn't think it's any of my business and what I said to Johanna was rude. In my opinion I was doing Johanna a favour.  I mean someone needs to tell her the reality that Michael is unlikely to propose.

580,"AITA for wanting to keep a $25 bluetooth device my sister bought for my car after letting her use my car for 5 months at no charge? On mobile, long story, sorry for formatting. 

For a little back story, my sister (22) and I (M, 20) have an awesome relationship. But like any brother and sister, we have quarrels. Some get out of hand at times. This last year, my sister landed a job in Colorado and she was going to start in June. I was leaving for a job in Alaska in June for the summer, so I didn’t need my car. I told my sister she could take my car to Colorado (we live in Texas) and that she could use it and not even have to worry about paying me for using it and putting thousands of miles on it. 

Flash forward to October, I’m back from Alaska, and i need my car. So i fly to Denver, she picks me up and we drive back to Texas. My car is a little older so it doesn’t have bluetooth or AUX stereo, so my sister bought a $25 bluetooth FM converter. She stays home for a couple days and flies back to CO, and says I can keep the device as she doesn’t have a car and won’t need it. 

Flash forward to January, and she’s back and wants to buy a car. She buys one and it also doesn’t have AUX or Bluetooth in it, and so when she picks me up (I’ve moved out) to show me her new car, i grab the bluetooth device from my car so we can listen to music. When she’s dropping me off, i go to grab the device to which she says “Oh, that’s mine” and i say “but you gave it to me?” and she says, “no i didn’t, i just didn’t need it, get out of my car”. I’m appalled as i didn’t freak out or anything so i get out of her car, obviously mad. 

A couple days go by, she’s leaving for Colorado the next morning, and we’re at my families house and am on my way out and go to her car and grab the device. The next morning, i wake up to her calling me and saying “where is it?” and I say “i grabbed it last night, you gave it to me!” and she says “no i didn’t, bring it back to me you thief! you stole from me!” 

I’m furious at this point. I say “I let you use my car for 5 months at no charge, i think the least you could do is just let me keep this $25 device”, and she demands i drive 30 minutes to her to give it back to her and apologize. I don’t give in, I say just go buy a new one, and she starts crying and saying how she doesn’t have enough money for that and “how will I drive these 14 hours with no music”. I’m shocked and say you can buy an even cheaper one or use headphones if you’re that desperate. 

Eventually after we’re off the phone, i decide to be the bigger person and just drive and drop it off at my parents house, and at this point i didn’t even want to look at her. But she came outside looking mad. And i said “look i’m sorry for all this but you understand where i’m coming from”. She doesn’t apologize once, didn’t say she was wrong for calling me an asshole, liar, thief, inconsiderate, etc. She just said thank you for doing the right thing. I don’t even want to talk to her.

Around 2 years ago an old friend of mine (called T here) became addicted to heroin. Although I knew they were using various recreational drugs for many years prior, I didn’t realize the degree until their heroin addiction was leaked to me by T’s colleague, who needed immediate help bringing T to rehab / family. T’s colleague warned me that T would deny being on heroin, which they did on the day they I took T to the airport.

Rehab was in different state and my contact with T has been sparse. I’m not sure how much rehab or therapy was actually attended. I’ve had mainly digital contact with T since their relocation, during which T has said they’ve been doing better, although avoiding being open about details. Others that have interacted more closely with T have said otherwise, siting drug related behavior and other illegal activities. My trust and general feeling of friendship with T have really declined to say the least.

Recently, T contacted me to tell me that they are engaged and their SO is pregnant, acting as if the only thing to discuss is how I could best attend the wedding. I feel this is a red flag, and am worried that T has glossed over their addiction with their SO and may be using the situation for personal gain with no real regard for their SO or child.

I comment to make sure its JUST us, several times (why would the brother join in such an intimate and important occasion for me)

I get a yes, ""just my grandparents""...Im really nervous... Leave work early and start to prepare, unwind/shower... (Im introducing parents to a new family after a separation from LTR of 6yrs)

Two hrs before reservation, he makes it into the city and nonchalantly comments how his brother and brothers girlfriend will be joining.

Our intimate reservation turns into a large party, with no communication to me about it, he even called and altered my previous reservation beforehand he tells me.

I became more upset as the scenario unfolded, I got 6 words in the whole night to my dad, the seating was awkward, my parents speak english OK, but not fluent... His grandparents speak decent spanish, Id wanted to bridge the divide but with an extra couple at dinner the convo turned mostly english and the night got away from me, it was draining trying to keep it together, afterwards my SO apologized saying it was ""just a dinner"" and ""didnt think Id mind"" the extra company..

I felt robbed of my experience and still feel like it was unfair to my parents, ive asked my SO to give me a weekend (when we usually see each other) just to get over it. If I could have cancelled I would, I felt hostage going there and didnt enjoy the experience, I dont even know what my parents and his g-parents talked about,

Am i the asshole blowing this out of proportion? 

His brothers girlfriend was really sweet and mid dinner re seated herself at the end of the table so we could be closer to my parents... She clearly didnt know my parents were meeting the fam for the first time.

It was so awkward, and I dont know exactly WHY this has bothered me so much. Ive asked for space but is it unfair to my SO?

Edit:
Yes my SOs brother is awesome and for further background, after several months of not seeing the g-parents on the night they arrived we all had dinner and said brother opted out because ""he had to work out"" several dinners and outings have happened since (not like it would garner ""left out"" feelings), ? ?

yes this was a major step in the relationship, and yes it is so drenched w cultural pressure, the personal ""feel robbed"" ""held hostage"" is the best way to illustrate my feelings, although I didnt act this way that night and more so my question is about the space.... I feel like im punishing my SO, (which makes me feel doubly bad) but know no other way than to think about whats happened because of the hype my culture puts on this and how casually it was treated, had i known the changes more that two hrs before the rez, again, id reschedule because i wouldnt want to offend my parents (im THAT daughter from super traditional upbringing ""divorced"" and now dating again, im first gen, raised here but not born in US). 

Also, previous to this wed had an opportunity to make this meeting happened and long story short, it didnt because neither of us was ready but prompted by my SO making the comment that my fam was busy. (Yes infront of me without discussing) There are some unspoken things about this and which aggravate the presence of another party who can have dinner with us all at a few hrs notice being interjected. 

I feel its so complicated but as I write this understand its mainly a disconnect between traditions that Ill probably just always battle internally and I do accept TA judgements because these pressures should end and they are so unhealthy for me to carry, wow thanks reddit.",[removed],1,YTA,0.0,1.0,0
597,"AITA for questioning my brothers parenting? It seems as though I have caused quite a bit of drama in my family and I am hoping for some insight from other parents and people in the Midwest or other places who understand this shit.

I grew up in a medium sized midwestern town but moved to Chicago for university and stayed. My brother went to school in another big midwestern city further south, where he met his wife and started a family. 

His daughter is now 7, and is involved in cheerleading and dance, and to be honest, she is very good at it and loves it. While I love my niece and I am happy she is very excited about her activities, the culture around it really rubs me the wrong way.

My brothers family was recently in town for one of my nieces competitions, my wife and I went. While all of the girls were great dancers, the whole things made my wife and I feel pretty gross. At her dance competition, all of the little girls wore very revealing, “sexy” outfits, and many of the moves involved gyrating and twerking. Further, her cheerleading team wears dark eye makeup and bright red lipstick at events, and the outfits are about the same as what high school cheerleader would wear. Again, my niece is 7.

Later over beers my bro and I were chatting and I told him that while I’m glad my niece is having fun, as a parent there is no fucking way I would let my daughter do it and he should find a different studio or something. My brother got defensive of his parenting being questioned and things got heated. I felt he wasn’t quite getting it and at some point I said the team makes his daughter look like a hooker and the way they dance and dress the kids is completely inappropriate. I also called the whole thing a bunch of honey boo boo bullshit for bored stay-at-home moms (his wife is a SAHM). Needless to say, we haven’t spoken since.

Now, my whole extended family has heard about this and while I believe some secretly agree with my views a few are saying I’m TA for wanting to ruin my nieces fun, and that it’s “ok for little girls to dress up and feel pretty”. I think my brother is TA for allowing his wife to sexualize his first-grader and not protecting her.

So, Reddit, what do you think? Anyone else have kids in dance? Am I way off-base with this? I also want women’s opinions. If I’m TA I’ll accept my judgement and apologize to my bro.","YTA. 

> I  said the team makes his daughter look like a hooker 

This is so far over the line I suspect it will take quite a lot of time and work to repair your relationship with your brother. It’s possible there are issues with the studio’s approach (and certainly things like this exist that are unhealthy for the kids involved), but I have a hard time trusting your judgement about this issue when you are also getting worked up over lipstick and people being stay at home moms. It seems like a lot of other things may be clouding your view of what the issue is.",1,YTA,0.0,0.0,0

609,"AITA for not paying my portion of a trip with friends that I can no longer go on? About a month ago a friend asked me about a two night weekend away with myself, my boyfriend, herself and boyfriend and her two other friends and their significant others. It’s over two weeks away at this point and I just found out I can’t go because of something work related. I tell my friend this and she insists I still need to pay my portion - including part of the deposit? I told her I don’t really feel like I should have to pay for the trip and was surprised she felt that way. For them to split it the total cost three ways would be an extra $70 per couple. We are all working professionals and I don’t see this stressing anyone out financially. Also it’s not like I’m cancelling the day before - it’s over two weeks away.

Anyway - She told me that I needed to contact all the other people coming on the trip to ask them about the additional money - even tho she’s the person that booked everything and I’ve only met them a couple times. And I have texted them about it, apologizing and basically asking if they feel I need to contribute. I obviously don’t want to be the asshole here - but I feel like if someone else couldn’t make the trip I wouldn’t even think about it and just pay any additional funds. What do you guys think?

edit: I just want to clarify that the accommodation was going to be booked regardless if all or some of the couples could go. Initially only three couples were going but then it was changed to four.

Also - a portion of the cost includes the refundable deposit. If I pay it then she will have to pay me back. Should I responsible to pay the damages deposit if I won’t be there?

Another edit: I did apologize to the other couples and let them know that I would pay the amount if it would put unneeded stress on them.","YTA - You owe at the very minimum your deposit cost.

610,"AITA for telling my SIL that she is not the real mom of our nephews and niece and should respect that our siblings would NOT want them homeschooled? I lost my brother and SIL about a year ago now. My SIL’s sister was their godmother, so she has full legal custody of our three nephews and niece. The oldest is four. 

My brother and SIL were against homeschooling in any form. I’m fairly certain they were actually part of a group advocating for it to be made illegal. Apparently, however, my SIL’s sister, I’ll call her Cora, is completely the opposite. She has “always planned to homeschool [her] children, and that won’t change now, especially given how bad the local schools are.”

Cora has a degree in classical studies and history. She’s working on getting a teaching license now. She should have it by the end of June, she says, which means she’ll have it in time for the oldest to start Kindergarten. She also says that it makes what she’s doing more like private tutoring, but my brother and SIL were against that as firmly as they were traditional homeschooling. 

Side note: Yes, Cora works. She does something from home. I’m really not sure of the details. 

I tried to talk to Cora and explain that, when she had a kids, she can raise them how she wishes. She shot back that they are her children now, and she has to do what she feels is best, and a school with asbestos in the ceiling is a non-option if there ever was one. We argued more. 

I got a call from my mom this morning telling me to make other arrangements for Thanksgiving. Apparently, Cora had called to apologize that she and the kids wouldn’t be coming this year as planned because she “wanted to let things cool off between us.” Mom refused to miss seeing her grandbabies on Thanksgiving, so “since [I] made this mess,” I’m  the one who gets left out

611,"AITA for pretending to be unwell for an extra day because my boyfriend was so caring during this time? Hey y'all 

So I've been dating my boyfriend for a 11 months and we have a great relationship but have different love languages. I'm very affectionate and romantic and he's is more of a ""man's man"". He's not soft but he still shows love in other ways like bringing me home dinner without asking or fixing my car when it breaks down (which is ALOT lol)

So anyways I just got over a terrible bout of food poisoning that started last Sunday night and I had to take 3 days off work just to recover. I couldn't eat or even keep water down, let alone move out of the cocoon I made out of my couch. I text James saying I couldn't see him tonight (tues) because i was ill and I was sorry we'd have to reschedule our date. He never text me back but instead turned up to my house with an over night bag and other comfort goodies and said he was going to stay and take care of me. I thought it was so sweet I almost cried, over the next 2 days he waited on me hand and foot, held my hair and showered me with kisses and cuddles which is really out of character for him. On Thursday I woke up feeling great and he left for work asking if I was going back to work that day but I lied and said no because I wasn't feeling better yet.

I'm just not used to it and last week was an absolute dream regardless of my sickness 💔 I just wish he was always like that.","YTA You shouldn't have to lie to your SO to ""trick"" him into giving you the affection you want.

612,"AITA for not tipping? I recently went into a chain hair salon to get a haircut. So I check in online, head over, really nice lady cuts my hair, we talk a little about movies and plans and stuff, everything goes great. Great haircut, looks good, I have every intention of tipping 20%. At this particular establishment, haircuts are $15, so 20% would be $3.

Anyway, once she is done cutting my hair, we walk over to the register and I realize I don’t have any singles in my wallet. I end up paying with a 20, hoping to get some singles in change. Instead, I get a 5 dollar bill, so I decide against giving her anything extra and I leave.

On the way home, I started to feel really bad about not tipping the lady. When I got home, I texted somefriends about it and asked what they thought. Some said it was the lady’s mistake that she gave me a 5 instead of singles, so I didn’t have to tip. Others said I should’ve asked for singles instead of a 5.

613,"AITA for not letting my best friend's Service Dog in my new car? Background: This is my best friend. The literal Maid of Honor in my wedding. We have been through it all together. I feel as though I have saved her life multiple times, and she has always been there for me in return. We are basically sisters, and I would do anything for her... Except maybe this (Unless it was an emergency)

Before I got my new car, I would pick up my friend a lot and give her rides. She has a Service Dog (Do not ask for what, I will not tell), that is an Australian Shepard. Sweetest dog, but a LOT of shedding. Before, I had a 2005 Jeep Liberty that was on it's way out. She always has her dog sit in front of her in the passenger side seat.

This year, I bought a new 2019 Jeep Cherokee. No cosigner, completely mine, which is a HUGE adult step in my life. Needless to say, the car is my new baby. I have a carwash membership, and I don't allow my car to be dirty for more that 3-4 days without feeling extreme guilt. At the time, I had a conversation with my friend about her dog. I let her know that if she purchased a cover for the back seat, then her dog could ride in the trunk. But it would be HER responsibility to put it on and take it off in between rides.

She works about a 20 minute walk away from our home, and will normally walk with the dog to work since she doesn't drive. Many times, her cousin, who also lives with us, will pick her up if she works really late.

Now, this is where we get into it. Today we are going to see a movie together since I have been busy and she has physically asked me to spend time with her. She gets off at 4:30, so it may be starting to get dark, but not horribly. But she asks me if I will pick her up with the dog.

Unfortunately, I believe that this is a ""give an inch, take a mile"" kind of situation, so I tell her that we haven't gotten a cover for the backseat yet, and leave it at that.

It's the next part that irks me. She tells me that I can try convincing our other roommate to pick her up OR she can meet me here. (Small vent) Since when is it my responsibility to find you a ride? It is a nice day outside - there is no reason why I need to convince someone for you.

I told her that I would ask that roommate if/when she wakes up from sleeping. Otherwise she will have to walk home.

614,"AITA for putting more value on my job than my fiance's? Two years ago I made the decision to go to grad school in Richmond, VA to eventually get a better job in my field so that I could travel and not worry about needing a job so much, as well to be at the top of my profession. My longtime girlfriend decided to not move with me but instead stayed in NYC because she liked her job and has family in NYC. We decided to stay together long-distance and actually got engaged not too long ago.

&#x200B;

I am about to graduate and have been looking at jobs at different cities around the country and although NYC has a great job market, it's just not a place that I want to go back to since I had worked there before grad school and we have lived there our whole lives.  I could very easily get a job in NYC, but will not feel happy if I do so.

&#x200B;

My fiance has been very adamant about staying in NYC, because she says that her job is great and moving would be too difficult. To be honest her job is just okay, it is the only job she has had since graduating undergrad-five years ago and doesn't pay her enough to allow us to save much money. I honestly think she is just afraid of trying to find a new job, where I am the opposite and want to live in a bunch of different cities before we get to old. As you can tell I think her job is a dime a dozen, but it makes her feel important.

615,"WIBTA if I [34M] taught my daughter [1.5F] to request songs in the car? My wife [29F] drives her to daycare usually. My daughter’s daycare is in the same building as my wife’s work. My wife has a really cool job, that lets her travel several times a year to a variety of places around the world. The trips are about a week at a time and while my wife is gone I drive my daughter to daycare, then turn around and drive an hour the opposite direction to get to my own job, reverse in the evening.

So while we’re in the car, my daughter doesn’t have a ton of ways to be entertained and so I play music for her. She’s learning words fast and already knows how to request “Elmo” either to have the TV turned on for Sesame Street or for one of the songs I play for her in the car, which obviously Elmo sings.

We’ve worked out a system where she can tell me if she likes or dislikes the current song, but it is very inefficient. I’d like to teach her words for more songs she might want to request, just so I can help her be happy during the car ride. The next obvious candidate is the infamous “Baby Shark”.

Where I worry I might be the Asshole, is that I only drive my daughter to daycare about one week out of every month, at the most. The rest of the time, my wife is driving her and I know my wife likes to listen to podcasts. (IE not “Baby Shark”.)

Where I think I might not be the Asshole is that my daughter is going to learn words to request songs by herself sooner or later. With any given song, I might not be speeding it up by more than a month.

We didn't have room for it in the new place, so we asked a friend who had just moved into a larger place if she wanted the couch, and she accepted.  She rented a truck and came to pick it up.

Edit 2:the issue has been resolved that my younger cousin will be sharing with me and my aunt and uncle with share a room but opinions is still appreciated 

Some info first:
This is my first post and I'm posting on mobile. 
So I currently live with my parents as I'm not old enough to move out. It's a 1 story flat with 2 and a half bedrooms. I have my own room and my mum and dad share a room, my older brother has the small room. For scale it's about the size of a jail cell, Just enough for a double bed and for the door to still open. My girlfriend also stay at mine every Saturday and will be here for the first few days my family arrives. 

I live in the southeast of England, my aunt uncle and cousin are coming down from Scotland for roughly 2 weeks.

So my mum has asked if I would take my brothers room so my aunt and uncle can have my bed and my cousin sleep on the floor in my room. We do have an inflatable double bed that can fit in the living room and a large couch which would be enough for 4 people to sleep on atleast.

I said that I didn't want to sleep in my brothers room as my pc and other belongings like my clothes are in my current room so if I want to go on my pc or get clothes have to hope no one is in my room at the time, also my girlfriend would also be in the bed as well and she likes to fall asleep watching YouTube. I have a really bad sleep schedule and I'm usually up till early hours in the morning so I like to watch YouTube or play games till I feel tired.

I have physical conditions that require me to rest every hour or so, given the work I do gets quite intensive. They have a designated area for resting, made for those who are feeling under the weather, and for me to rest in.

Edward loves this room. He has no physical conditions aside from being overweight, and loves taking the couch (there's only a couch and an armchair), which kinda screws me over given a lot of my problems are back-related. While sitting there, he has his phone on full blast, mouth breathes incessantly and does a variety of snorts and grunts.

It's intensely annoying for someone who needs that rest. So I've started working against him. I obviously don't wanna stir shit up, so I do it passive-aggressively, by spreading my stuff out on the couch so he has no choice but the armchair. I also have a size advantage, despite my health issues, being 6foot and fit, with him being about 5'5 and pudgy, so that kinda works in my favor.

I told my friends this, and one of them called me a dick for antagonizing him, apparently because he's autistic or something, ignoring the fact that I'm mildly autistic myself. Honestly, I don't hold a grudge outside the shit he pulls with the rest area, so AITA here?

I've been seeing my girlfriend for about 8 months now. When we were falling asleep she told me that a little before we met she signed up for multiple sugar baby websites because she needed money to travel. I was immediately speechless. She is a very reserved girl who never did casual hookups and I really liked that about her. She told me how multiple old men sent her messages asking for pictures. She says that she never sent them any photos. Part of me questions if that is true. I initially reacted by asking her why traveling was more important than her self respect. She did not like that and immediately started to cry. We argued for several minuets and I felt so differently about her. I lost some respect for her when she told me that. Then I went out for a smoke break to collect my thoughts, and when I came back I apologized to her for saying the things I did and I thought I felt okay about it. But I can't stop getting the thought out of my head of her sending old dudes naked photos. I really wanna bring it up again but I feel like I'm the asshole.

I can be a bit perfectionistic when it comes to giving presents so I tend to procrastinate buying/putting it together. On more than one occasion I’ve given people late birthday presents (think a week to a month after the date). I typically warn the recipient in a lighthearted manner and apologize meekly for the delay. It’s because I want the gift to be a good one, not something the recipient might toss aside.

For one of my best friend’s birthdays, I gave her her present a month after her actual birthday. It was a pair of expensive leggings that cost $120. She was really happy with them and didn’t seem to mind that her present was so late. But maybe she didn’t mind because we’re close? Perhaps someone to whom I’m not as close would react differently?

646,"AITA for not paying for my sister-in-law to join us on Spring Break? I married my husband from another country, happens to be a 3rd world country where his family is very poor. We live in the US and have good jobs and enjoy a comfortable lifestyle with our two young daughters (ages 5, 7). I work hard so that I can save and travel, it's what we do as a family and what we really enjoy. Important Note: We are not rich, not by any standards. We just prioritize travel and creating experiences over buying things. We've visited several continents with our kids and have plans to travel to Mexico this upcoming Spring Break.

My husband has a kid sister whom we became guardians over 2 years ago--she is now a senior in high school. I initiated this and brought her from her country to live with us so that she could have a better future. This decision obviously created lots of change for our family--our two daughters now share a room instead of having their own, we have family dinner together every night as a family of five, I am her advocate getting her into a great high school, finding her counseling for trauma she has experienced, creating structure for things like homework, a chore chart around the house with allowance, drivers ed, doctor appointments, planning for university, etc etc. Last year I paid for her to do a 6 week trip back to her country to visit her friends/family and over XMas this year I am bringing her with us (obviously--it's the holidays) as we visit my parents in Arizona--she'll get a 3 week fun trip at a resort-like location with the rest of us. I've encouraged her several times to consider getting a part time job so she can pay for gas when she starts driving (we are providing her a vehicle at no cost) and other things she might want to buy (makeup, post-high school travel or other plans, etc). She has yet to do this even though she says she wants one.

I said that if she wanted to go she could have gotten a part time job and shown initiative in saving money for things that are important to her.

647,"AITA for suggesting that my daughter wear contacts? I am mum to a beautiful 20 year old called Lucy. She has just finished her second year at uni and is at home for the summer. 

My niece Jennifer is getting married in a few weeks time and we have of course been invited. 

Lucy is a very girly girl type person, loves getting dressed up and trying new clothes so she is very excited. 

Lucy has got bad vision and has worn glasses from a very early age. She has tried contacts a few times but hates them, both because high prescription contacts are uncomfortable, and also because she feels like she doesn't look like herself without her glasses. 

Lucy was helping me with some shopping yesterday and in the car ride home we were discussing the wedding, what we were going to wear, what we were doing regarding makeup etc. I made some suggestions to Lucy regarding hair/makeup, but also (maybe thoughtlessly?) suggested she could maybe try contacts. Soon as I said this she gave me a look and was quiet the rest of the car journey. She went upstairs as soon as we got home. 

I didn't see her until dinner time, and when I asked what was wrong, she asked why I ''told'' her to wear contacts, and asked if I was ashamed to have a daughter who has to wear ''thick'' glasses. She then took off her glasses and tried to eat her dinner without them. Within a minute or so she was clearly struggling and was close to tears, and asked her dad to get her glasses for her, and she took her food and went to eat upstairs. 

My husband was annoyed with me, asking why I had to suggest contacts to her when I know she doesn't like them. In my defence it was just an impulsive suggestion that came out without even thinking. I have nothing against her glasses and think Lucy is beautiful with or without them. It was just a suggestion to see if she'd like to try a different look.

So about a week or so before Valentine's Day, she and I agree that neither of us will give the other any of the traditional love-day fare, like candy, flowers, etc. Or so she thinks.

I dated my ex-fiance Linus for six years, and prior to that we were very good friends and part of the same friend group since college. We broke up two years ago because I started to have feelings for my now fiancé Jarno. The break up was emotional but Linus said that he understood and thanked me for not cheating on him. We stayed friends and continued to spend time together with our friend group.

When I started dating Jarno, my friend Tessa told me that Linus said he thinks I won’t be with Jarno for long because of the differences in our social and economic backgrounds and that when we break up he is sure that I will go back to him. It was difficult to hear but I thought to myself that Linus was understandably upset that I’m dating the man who is the reason why I broke off our engagement, so he must be saying things to make himself feel better.

In the almost two years that Jarno and I have been together, Linus has been nothing but kind and helpful to us. He was always nice to Jarno and even introduced him to his friends who were able to help Jarno with his work. Linus never made romantic advances towards me and he dated other girls so I thought he already moved on. 

Jarno and I got engaged recently, and last weekend while I was working on my guest list with Tessa, she told me that Linus was upset and spent the night drinking when he learned of my engagement. I asked our friend Hans if it was true and he told me it was. I was surprised because the day after our announcement, Linus sent messages to me and Jarno congratulating us and wishing us the best.

I decided to talk to Linus and he admitted that he still has feelings for me. But he said that he accepts that I don’t feel the same and he respects my relationship with Jarno that’s why he befriended him and never made advances towards me. He said he’s heartbroken for himself but happy for me.

I still wanted to invite Linus to the wedding because it feels wrong to not invite him given that he’s my friend, he’s part of my friend group and everyone else will be there, and he has done a lot for me and Jarno. Jarno has no issues with me inviting Linus because he says he can’t get angry at Linus for still having feelings for me when he never acted on it and was always kind to us. 

But Tessa pointed out that we should think about it carefully because knowing what we know, inviting Linus will be like rubbing salt on a wound. Like telling him I know you still love me, now here is your front row seat come and watch me get married to the guy I left you for.

One of my (19f) dear and close friends (19m) takes part in a drama group of our campus. He just started last summer and honestly, he's really good considering he never seriously did theatre plays before. He also says it helps him a lot with school stress which is always good.

Anyhow, this is a small and relatively new group. They've only been in one competition in the last two years. It's also disorganized since it has bunch of different people with their own personal obligations. My friend always makes fun of their inability to agree about rehearsal and complains about the incompetence of some members who're literally just another person's friend or a cousin.

Well here's the thing, they recently did a short French play ""The Chairs"" and I came to watch it. Most of the audience was friends, family, classmates of the students in the group. My friend was really good if you ask me because he actually put in effort, but the play looked rushed and disorganized. A lot of the people forgot their lines or just didn't know how to understand them, so there were some awkward silences.

Some of us classmates hung out later and people started commenting the play. One girl pointed out how some actors just basically didn't understand their lines. Nobody disagreed so I joked that there's a lot of nepotism in that group (half of them being cousins, friends) and that's why they don't even try to be good.

I probably said that weirdly because my friend got mad. He told me later in private that it's embarassing for me to criticize him and his friends so openly, and that I should tell him one-on-one about these opinions. So he thinks I was referring to him in the nepotism part because one of the people in the group is his best friend. That's not true, I think he's one of the best actors but he's not convinced now, he thinks it was a passive-aggressive comment. I think he's also angry because I said that while the guy he likes was in the room, but that's just my guess.

I recently had a get-to-gether with some friends after a long day of work, and while I was at work was mulling over pizza places in my head to get and bring to our get-to-gether. I decided on a build-your-own pizza place in my neighborhood I’d never been to before, and during my break placed my order online.

They told me my order would be ready around 6:45, just 15 minutes after my shift ended. At 6:35, just after I’d started towards my car, I received a text from the pizza place. The message said that they have an extremely high volume of orders tonight, and that they had to cancel my order. They told me my \~ $40 order was refunded, apologized, and in return offered me a deal for a free $10 build-your-own pizza.

Needless to say, I was pretty pissed. Since when is it okay to just “bump” orders? Why should those ordering online be treated second-fiddle to those dining in? And now, I’d have to go to the trouble of finding another pizza place, and dinner was going to be very late. In the heat of the moment, I typed an angry message back. “Oh joy! I’m already starving to death, waited all this damn time, and you have the nerve to cancel my order. What a load of fucking bullshit!”

I never received a response. A week later for lunch, I went to the pizza place, specified the toppings for my pizza, and went to the checkout as it was being prepared. I told the person at the checkout I have a deal for a free pizza, and he asked my name and plugged it into the system. He said nothing was coming up and went to ask his supervisor. 

The supervisor, a woman in her 30’s, came out and told me that I’m not getting the deal. I asked why, and she told me that it’s because I was “extremely rude” to their employees via text message when I was told about my order being cancelled. She made clear that “disrespect and foul language towards our employees is not tolerated”, and that they didn’t have to offer me a deal in the first place; if I’m not going to behave gratefully for their deal offer, I’m not entitled to it.

I was greatly angered by this. I questioned the lady why they’re telling me this just now when I’m checking out, instead of when I first sent the message. Seems very shady to me. I argued for a while until I gave up (so other people in line weren’t held up) and paid. 

But after leaving, I called the company’s corporate office (they’re a chain) and complained about how I wasn’t given the deal I was offered, after they cancelled my order. I stressed how this place has a bad habit of making promises and not keeping them; they promise dinner at 6:45 and cancel 10 minutes before; they promise a deal for a free pizza and yank it away right as you’re checking out.

She's the only vegetarian in the house, so she gets her food separate to us. When we go to do the food shop each week mum gives her some money and she goes off on her own while me and mum sort out the food for everyone else. One night a week she does all the cooking and makes a vegetarian dish for the whole house to eat, and the rest of the week she sometimes offers us leftovers.

Last week dad burned dinner. Everyone else went to bed and I saw my sister had made herself some veggie soup and left it on the stove. It smelled really good and as she usually offers us leftovers I figured she wouldn't miss a cup. There was probably about 2 cups of soup left in the pot, so I had a cup, and then come the next morning she's asking me if I had some of her soup, as she was planning on filling a thermos with the (apparently carefully measured out) remaining soup and that was going to be her food all day at school. I apologised again and she said ""whatever, just use your common sense"".

Then the end of last week I got a migraine. Migraines usually leave me chugging energy drinks and craving something salty, followed by something sweet. I went down to the kitchen, saw a bag of crisps out on the counter, and pretty much dove on them. I looked in the cupboard and found a 6 pack of mini rolls, and had 3. Not my proudest moment but I hadn't eaten in about 30 hours, and migraines really take it out of me. I stayed awake long enough to brush my teeth before crawling back into bed.

Later that morning I wake up and find that a quarter of the kitchen is labelled. I open the cupboard, and a multipack of crisps (the kind I ate) and what's left of the mini rolls all have her name on them. I text her asking what is going on. She replies ""I'm sorry I had to get passive aggressive, but my food budget for the week is literally whatever cash mum has on her when we do the food shop. My meals and snacks are all portioned out. I know you had your migraine so I figured you didn't realise the food you ate was mine, but that was 3 days of snacks for me, and you ate it in one hit. Mum and dad said I should label my stuff so it didn't happen again"".

Then today I had my late start at sixth form, I woke up ready to make myself some breakfast before I left, and the cereal that me and my parents share was all out. My sister buys her cereal in variety packs, so she gets several mini boxes. All of the mini boxes had my sister's name on and I knew I'd get a bollocking for it but I had no cash on me and didn't have time to make a bacon sandwich, so I just grabbed a couple of minis and had some cereal before I left the house. The boxes had her name on them. I'm in college, she's gone home for lunch, and she's texted saying ""fucking really??? two boxes???""

661,"AITA for buying my 12yo son a cellphone without discussing with my ex? My ex and I have been divorced for eight years. I get my sons one week, she gets them another. We live on opposite sides of town with their school being in the middle. A part of our custody agreement is that the weekly custodial parents has to let them get at least 30 minutes of communication with the non-custodial parent when they are at the custodial parent's house. Before it was a quick phone after school or before bed. Lately our 12yo has preferred Facetime and either used his mom's computer or my cellphone. He's been pushing for more independence ranging from asking us to drop him off further from and to school and wanting more privacy when he Facetimes me at his mom's. I bought him a cellphone as a balance. I can drop him off or pick him up anywhere but in front of the school because we can text and he can Facetime me from his bedroom instead of the living room at his mom's. He doesn't really use it outside of that. It's nothing fancy.

Yesterday I ran into my ex after a school performance and she threw a fit in the parking lot that I didn't consult her about getting him the phone. I told her I didn't need to consult her anymore about getting him a phone anymore than I would have to consult her about getting him deodorant. It's something he needed and should have. It wasn't a reward. I brought up how she allowed him to have Instagram account without consulting with me (which I didn't care about) and she tried to say it was different because that was for her family so I told her the phone for my family (BTW I don't have the password for his IG account, but she has the PIN for his phone). She started splitting hairs with the argument and I told her to agree to disagree or take me to court (which she won't) or kick rocks.","YTA

We invited everyone in our group of friends and it just so happened the day most people were free was my friends birthday. So we invite her too of course and she says no and doesn’t really give a reason (which is fair enough). Few days later we see eachother again and I go to say Hi and she ignores me. I ask her if everything is okay and she basically says we are all awful friends for not getting her a gift for her birthday.

I have Monday and Tuesday off, and she works during my days off. I love my gf, but she's really organized and has her shit together, while I'm admittedly kind of a lazy turd. She's been helping me get my life on track (credit score, bills, etc.) and she writes out a list of things for me to do on the whiteboard. Well, long story short, I spent Monday playing video games instead of accomplishing anything, and about 45 minutes before she got off work, I started hurrying to get stuff done. Of course I didn't get everything done by the time she got home (big city traffic still screws with me), and she was annoyed when she got home. That part, I know I should've actually been doing chores. 

During dinner, she started saying that she wasn't exactly mad at me, she was more annoyed that I hadn't accomplished anything major with my day off. She said that on her days off, she really doesn't have any layabout down-time. I know that I'm lazy, but I really didn't want to hear it. That really ticked me off, and as she was saying that I need to think more about using my time, I simply said, ""I'm gonna go.""

666,"AITA for letting my friend go home drunk, alone and coatless after she started screaming at me in the street Okay so last night I was out with my friend at a club (both F 29). We had put our coats on a stool and bags under the table and were dancing beside it all night, taking it in turns to go up to the bar and get drinks.

At the end of the night my friend is very drunk (she had about 4 more drinks than me as I like to keep a light happy level and remain in control of my brain) and we go to pick up our belongings, but her coat is missing. She starts freaking out and crying and I try to keep her calm and help her look for it. The coat luckily had nothing in it, but had been a fairly expensive xmas present from her parents.

She freaks out more and more and by the time we get outside in to the bitter cold and rain she is starting to blame me as I 'must have not watched the stuff well enough' while she was at the bar. I explained to her that other people had put their things ontop of her coat and I was checking our stuff frequently so it must have happened right at the end of the night while we were both there as the last check I had done was about a half hour before.

She starts screaming at me infront of everyone coming out of the club and tries to storm off, but I follow her as I am obviously concerned and want to be sure she is safe. She turns round and screams at me another couple of times so I just figure that I need to let her go and sort herself out.

On my walk home I got about 5 abusive messages from her which I ignored. Obviously I was upset about how she treated me, but I understand she was very drunk and upset and cold etc, so was not in her right mind. This morning she asked me to go through what had happened and I messaged her the full story. She did not apologise for screaming and embarassing me and made me feel like a bit of asshole for not making sure she got home safe in that state.

667,"AITA for confronting my SO's friend? Context for later: my SO's friend got into a car accident 2 weeks ago, in which she collided head-on with a tree because she was on her phone. This is important for later. 

&#x200B;

My SO goes to college, and carpools with a friend. Their school is quite far (45 min. on a good day) so they carpool. I sometimes go and pick up my SO if need be, or if we have plans later. The days I go pick her up ends up being me out of the house from around 2 in the afternoon to 7 or 8,

Here's the issue. My SO's friend is usually good when it comes to driving her back home, but the times she doesn't are always due to rather petty things and very short notice. Sometimes she'll leave early and tell my SO at the last second, forcing me to ditch the time I had for schoolwork and fucking up my schedule as well as my SO's.

Then there's today. I've been working on an important project for one of my classes, and my SO texts me that her friend can't take her home because she's doing her mother's hair at noon, when both their classes end around 4. This pissed me off because they had agreed to carpooling way before that, as well as to take my SO to a nail appointment after school, and they wouldn't reasonably be home until about 9. 

I don't get mad at things like this. I try to use reason and see everything from both sides. I told her friend that while I know it's hard to say ""no"" to a parent, it seems to be inconsiderate to change plans with my SO at the last second, making me abandon my schoolwork while jeopardizing my SO's plans in the afternoon. She then told me that I have no right to get mad (which I wasn't), I occasionally pick her up from school anyways, and that her mom comes first. Then I told her that I agree family does come first in many cases, but doing her mom's hair isn't as pressing as going through with taking someone home, especially when that agreement came first."" This caused her to tell me that ""things come up"" which causes plans to change. I told her that her argument would be valid for an actual emergency, but that I thought leaving my SO without a ride and forcing me to put my schoolwork on hold for the entire day was a bit rude (especially when this is far from the first time), and that I felt her mom's hair wasn't the highest priority compared to a deal she made first. 

Then, she told me she wasn't gonna waste her time arguing with me, and that she wasn't gonna sit there and argue when ""I know that to me, I'm right"". I felt I hadn't said anything to warrant that, which pissed me off. I told her ""Logic and reasoning don't matter when your feelings keep you sure in yourself"" and then ""remember next time you're driving that your main priority is not hitting trees and staying on the road, maybe that'll help you keep your priorities straight."" Then she called me a dick, and the conversation ended. She's been doing this to my SO many times, and I felt like today was when I had to speak up. Was ITA, guys? ","YTA.

668,"AITA for calling my mom out on getting my nephew crappy chinese knock-off toys Today was my nephews 8th birthday. For months he’s been asking for a kids smartwatch (not an Apple Watch or anything crazy, something like [this, yanno?](https://www.vtechkids.com/smartwatchdx2) .) 

Anyway, today we sat down and ate dinner, we ate cupcakes and when he goes to open his presents he gets what he asked for-
1. a set of water guns to shoot each other with 
2. a kids smart watch!

However, upon opening the smartwatch box, the whole box is in chinese. You turn the watch on, it plays a shitty little jingle and shows “Good Welcome!” on the screen with a picture of a rainbow. Perfect.
 My nephew was excited so I wasn’t gonna say anything yet. We get home and while I go poopsie I decide to look up the watch on Amazon.

[I’m greeted with this. ](https://www.amazon.com/Smartwatches-Waterproof-Positioning-Communication-Flashlight/dp/B07PLG2J34/ref=mp_s_a_1_7?keywords=kids%2Bsmartwatch&qid=1557883966&s=gateway&sprefix=kids%2Bsma&sr=8-7&th=1&psc=1)

Now, there are multiple of this EXACT same watch all over Amazon, all the same price, all different sellers. Every single one, however, has broken english in almost every paragraph. If you look at the reviews and customer questions, the only good responses are from the seller themself. Most of the other comments are either
•kinda fishy looking
•old people
•saying not to order this watch as it’s literally a pile of shit.

Don’t fret though, as the watch comes in two styles! Pink and Bule! 

I called my mom out on this when my nephew went to bed and she got super upset. I didn’t yell at her or make fun of her or anything, I just showed her what I found and how to tell if these products are shitty chinese knockoffs. She got upset and kept saying that she ruined his birthday. 

I informed her that we can return it and get a refund (which we did), but she still seems super upset with me. We told my nephew and he was surprisingly understanding, yet I can tell my mom is still trying to avoid talking to me. Is this embarrassment or am I an asshole?

672,"AITA for ignoring a girl who talks too much and interrupts my conversations? There’s this girl at my school who I met because she was being left out of a conversation and out of being nice I decided to talk to her. She was really sweet and stuff and I enjoyed talking to her some mornings when I would get to school. But soon it came to her waiting near where I walk in and talking to me about random stuff like how she tried to reach  baby cousin to read, etc. She would talk to me for the entire time when I got to school and I’m the type of person who maintains eye contact with people and tries to listen to people who are addressing me. She started doing this everyday and it got to the point where I couldn’t talk to any of my other friends at school because she would follow me around talking about random stories. And if I was able to talk to someone, it was only a matter of time before she would try to jump in and talk about her experience with whatever I was talking about. 

Fast forward to last week (year round school), I hadn’t seen her all summer and when I got to school she came running up to me and started talking to me about her trip. I listened to her and when the bell rang I started to head to my class and it turns out she had the same class as me. She talked to me the entire time walking to the gym only pausing when the teacher took role. Then she continued to talk to me for the entire hour and a half. I tried to talk to one of my other friends who I hadn’t seen in awhile and she butted in, interrupting us and started to talk about what she though was related to the conversation that she wasn’t in. It got to the point where I kind of had to sit there and just let her ramble about the same thing over and over because she wouldn’t stop.

It’s kind of getting on my nerves because while I do like to talk to her, I also want to talk to my other friends and not have her constantly listening in and butting in or trying to help me with my homework even though I told her I don’t need any help. I have started to completely tune her out sometimes and go on my phone to signal to her that I don’t want to talk to her all the time but she still talks.

674,"WIBTA for taking my mom's debit card and taking her dying cat to a vet? A few weeks ago, my little sister (shes 8) got a 6-month-old kitten for her birthday from our grandma. My mother agreed to it, on terms that the kitten would be the ""family pet"" and not just our sisters. Last week, we got her spayed. Everything had been fine up until then. Since her operation, the kitten has lost so much weight. She vomits constantly and is always defecating all over herself. She's skinny and weak and she looks as if she is going to die. Alongside that, she hasn't eaten in days. Last night was especially bad. She hadn't moved all day, and I was extremely concerned for her.

&#x200B;

Two days after she started showing signs of being unwell, we took her back to the clinic who spayed her. They told us that she probably was just having a bit of a reaction to the medication she took during the operation and that we had no cause for worry. Two days later, she was significantly worse, and we took her in again. We brought her in to see a more reputable vet, who told us pretty much the same thing and gave us an anti-nausea prescription and an appetite inducer. She hacks up the pills we give her and just continues to get worse.

We just moved to a new city a few states over this summer for my husband’s job. Ava is a bit on the shy side, so she was nervous at first about going to a new school and making new friends, but she’s since joined a group of three girls at her school and is doing very well. She’s especially close to one of the girls, Grace, who comes from a Lutheran family.

Ava has started to express a lot of interest recently in joining the youth ministry Grace is part of, which is open to kids and teens in grades 6-12. At first, I didn’t think she would even able to join since she isn’t a member of Grace’s church, but it turns out that’s not a requirement.

I've never thrown a fit over not being able to play a male character, and Space Marines are beyond gender, transformed into sexless Angels of Death.

Am I in the wrong here?","YTA. 

Taking about suspension of disbelief when you're being Space Marines?

She's researched her character and you dismissed it out of hand.

Sounds to me that you just don't want her to play. Do you think she'll spoil your fun? Is it just a testosterone fest when you play? 

And pink armour would be the same as playing a female character? Wtf?

Maybe having a new character who is different could really make the whole thing more interesting and give it more levels.

At the end you said everyone is a sexless angel of death anyway, so are they all male or not? Make up your mind.",1,YTA,0.0,0.0,0

Thread that led to my ban: https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/6fad0s/harvard_rescinds_acceptances_for_at_least_ten/digs16i/

My appeal to the ban and rules of subreddit: 
https://imgur.com/a/lFTkS

As you can see, not only have I not broken any rules, I have not done anything that the moderator has accused me of. I have not provoked anyone, did not argue, was not downvoted, and was constructed. Not that any of those actions are against the rules.

Seriously, why is politics breaching a sub for teenagers trying to make a better life for themselves?

The above post was copied from /r/banned, but I like this sub too. Obviously I don't think I'm the asshole here, but clearly the mods do so I'm open to hear the public verdict if anyone cares enough to actually read all the stuff.","I get the impression that you were sincere in your comments, so my first instinct is to say ""not the asshole"" ... but on further reflection, **you're the asshole.** 

Technically, you **did** repost the same comment despite being downvoted... 

However, your real ""offense"" is failing to appreciate what's appropriate in a given setting. 

There are some places/times where intellectual discussion on controversial topics is welcomed. And there are many places/times where it's not welcomed. 

More obviously, there are also different subs for different topics. 

r/ApplyingToCollege is almost definitely not a sub intended for controversial discussion on what it means ""to be racist."" Without reading the rules, I'd guess that it is specifically intended for discussions about *applying to college.* 

So breaking down the situation, 

- you initiated a conversation on a specific topic 

- in a place that clearly *wasn't* meant for conversations on that topic

- you received hard-line, black and white answers that demonstrated no interest in pursuing an intellectual debate on the subject (they were presented as ""no, you're absolutely wrong on all counts, zero room for debate"") 

- yet you continued to pursue that conversation despite the clear signals that it wasn't being well-received. 

Even when there's nothing wrong with what you say, you can be an asshole by saying it in the wrong time and place. 

For example, obviously it'd be an asshole move to initiate this specific discussion on racism during the funeral of a black person killed by a white cop. That's an extreme example, but same concept. 

So you were an asshole for picking the wrong time and place to pursue this discussion, and then ignoring the clear signs that the discussion was unwelcome. 

**Side note:** 

The comparison between human-human interaction and human-animal interaction in a discussion about racism is flawed. You will rarely, if ever, gain any ground with that argument. 

I won't get into why because (a) I don't feel like it and (b) this isn't the right sub for it :P .... but head over to a sub like r/changemyview if you want to understand why that comparison is a loser. ",1,YTA,0.0,0.0,1
699,"AITA for being a blind person on Halloween? throwaway.  I did this about 15 years ago in my 20's. Halloween. I dressed up as a blind person. Prior to doing so, I weighed the ramifications, as I have always strived to be polite and respectful, esp toward those with disabilities. 

I played a role rather than wearing a  2D costume. I went to a medical supply store and bought a real foldable walking cane and wore unremarkable clothes and unremarkable sunglasses. 

Day of Halloween I tried it out in public by myself solo - for example, I took public transportation and tried my best to close my eyes and truly navigate without vision as best I could until I would steal a peek. In the pm I went to a large indoor rock concert and had a blast - a lot of ppl offered genuine help and I appreciated them - I went to buy a beer and need someone to verify what bill I took out of my wallet. Most ppl were very kind and generous. Overall, I felt as if I respected the role/costume/disability.

702,"AITA for not letting my ex-girlfriend use my car for a month? I broke up with my girlfriend of 2 years because were just not compatible and she isn't the same happy, carefree person she was in the start. It's hard for me to do because shes my best friend in the world but a lot has happened in her life in the past year that she isn't the same person anymore. 

She hasn't been yelling or freaking out at me, but I can stell shes stressed about the car. About 2 months ago, her cars engine exploded and I feel bad because it was partially my fault. It was the first car shes ever owned and she relied on me for advice/help with. She does not have any knowledge of cars, so one day she told me that when she presses on the breaks, sometimes a light comes on.

I took the car for a drive and saw the light myself. I mistakenly took it for a brake light, thinking her brake pads might be worn down a lot since it only came on when the brakes were being used. She scheduled an appointment to get the brakes done but the engine exploded soon after because it turned out to be an oil light. I felt bad since I told her it's safe to keep driving she she believed me because I have knowledge on cars. She hasn't blamed me at all for it but when it happened, she bawled her eyes out, which is why I felt so bad. She adamantly takes responsibility for her engine exploding, which is nice since she is the owner of the car, in my opinion. 

I have two cars that I own so I've been letting her use the one I never drive and she pays full coverage insurance for it. The stipulation to us breaking up is she has to give me my property back, that's how it goes. 

The reason I feel bad is because I know she leaves in a month for military duties and when shes done, she will be able to get another car and never have to worry about using mine again. Shes asked me if she can continue using mine for a month so she can go to work and finish paying off her debt this month, so when she leaves, shes debt free and has no bills. 

I said no and that's something she has to figure out on her own. The car is my property and we aren't together anymore. She has no right to use it. Her making me feel guilty by saying she will have no way to get to work is ridiculous. It's not my problem and she needs to find something else, maybe a job she can walk to for the month. 

AITA?","Let me get this straight. Your girlfriend asks you for car advice because she's under the impression your good with cars. You take the car out yourself, misdiagnose the problem, and tell her it's safe to drive. 

The misdiagnosis and green light to continue driving causes her engine to explode. She takes full responsibility even though it's your fault. And then you break up with her, leaving her without a car the month before she returns to the military.

I was in a bar yesterday after work having a few beers with some friends. As I was ordering some drinks I got talking with a woman. I'll call her Linda for this post. She seemed like ''my type'' bubbly personality, ''cute'' appearance, glasses etc. We just chatted and I was going to try and get her number. 

A few minutes later her friend came up. Not to be nasty but she was your typical ''pretty girl''. The first thing she did was give me a dirty look and then dragged her friend away from me. Disappointing but what can you do. 

Except that Linda came back to keep talking to me a few minutes later. She apologised for her friend and we kept chatting, until friend came up again and did the same thing. 

Linda came back one more time and I figured that to avoid any drama with the friend I would just ask for the number and leave ASAP. She both gave it to me and took my number. Friend arrived to drag her away again, and before I left I whispered to her ''Don't get jealous because no one's interested in you''. Her mouth hung open and I walked off. 

I got a text from Linda later on shouting at me for being rude to her friend, and telling me not to contact her which I won't.

704,"AITA for telling my mum she is a hypocrite for blocking my wifi? So I think that my mum is a hypocrite because she blocked my wifi (because she says I need to study more) and  because she caught me on my phone at night. 
It is true that I spend a long time on my phone but I enjoy it, and I don’t do anything bad, I don’t give out personal info or spend money.
 I understand if  she just blocked the wifi at night, but why can’t I have some time in the day? 
I don’t have anything against her internet use, everyone can do what they like in their spare time.
She spends at least 3 hours a day on her phone and 3 hours per night watching TV. She doesn’t really work or do much stuff in the day (she isn’t a housewife, we have a maid). 
In the summer she watches TV from 8 pm to 3 am continuously (she is watching one very long show). 
My stepdad spends all time after work watching TV, using a laptop or phone, from 4 pm to 1 am (not continuously, he eats dinner, then continues). He just spends his spare time in the “lounge room” with some gadget in hand.
 They don’t do anything productive online and my stepdad plays competitive games (where you build an empire and defend it and the football games). I also waste time online and I have nothing against their hobbies, I just think they’re treating me unfairly.
I go to school full-time and have music lessons, I feel like I deserve a few hours a day just to relax, like they do. 
I don’t mind that they use the internet, everyone can do what they like, but my mum thinks she is entitled to the internet (and she spends crazy amounts online shopping) but I’m not. Her excuse - I don’t study- isn’t valid because I just sleep or draw with no wifi, I just don’t want to study. 
I told her all of this and she just said “you’re addicted to the internet so I took it away from you and you’re ungrateful” and left. 
So can you tell me if its right that I get no internet and she spends hours on it? I think we should both be able to do what we like and that it’s unfair that I’m an “internet addict” but she spends so much time online and on the TV and she is not one.

TLDR: Mum spends total of 6 hours of electronics, dad too but they cut my wifi because apparently I’m the “internet addict”. I told my mum she is a hypocrite but she doesn’t agree. Is she a hypocrite?

705,"WIBTA for making a big financial decision without my spouse? Throwaway account.  I'm trying to keep it vague-ish.  Let me know if more details are needed?

Short version: Spouse and I have had significant budget problems for several years now.  I'm tired of the stress, so I want to get my own bank account and separate our finances.  WIBTA for doing this without talking to them?

Longer version: over the course of this year alone we've paid $2000+ in overdraft fees and it's turned into a really nasty cycle.  I'm from a very frugal (not quite poverty-line) background; you make do or go without and get used to eating a lot of box macaroni.  Spouse is from a much more middle-class background and is used to being able to buy what they want; last week they got angry, deliberately smashed a piece of electronics, and promptly ordered a new one which arrived the next day.  (They said afterward that the thing was already malfunctioning.)

Previous discussions don't seem to help anything, and Spouse definitely hasn't internalized the idea that we need to be a lot more careful with our money.  They want to eat out, they buy a lot of things online, and they hate when I push back or try to say it's not a good idea.  I'm dreading Christmas because I don't know how to afford their presents.

Reasons I think I might be the asshole: I am dealing with panic, stress, and constant worry about this, so that's probably screwing with my perception of how justified I am.  I'm also super conflict-avoidant and would generally rather handle something secretly instead of having another difficult conversation.  Spouse has accused me of trying to change them or control them in the past over this topic.  I can't tell anymore if going behind their back to separate the bank accounts is reasonable self-care, or shitty & selfish behavior.  I've also contributed to the problem because sometimes I see Spouse buying things for themselves, and get jealous and decide to do the same while deliberately ignoring the longer-term consequences.

So basically, I'm really hoping you guys tell me if IWBTA before I go and do something that might really screw up my marriage.

Edit:

""INFO, What do you want to see happen here, what do you think the consequences will be?""

 \- Honestly, what I really want is just to stop being overdrawn, and that we could start to get some savings built up.  This feels super precarious as things are right now.  The short-term consequences are that Spouse would probably be upset; longer-term, I think I'd be able to manage my money with many-fewer-to-none of these problems, and I would hope that they would also have to take responsibility for their own at that point without any excuses.","YWBTA here.

714,"AITA for telling my wife not to go easy on our kids when we play board games? I previously posted on r/TIFU where I showed mercy to my son during monopoly and it came back to bite me on my next move.  Many responded to that post saying that I should not have taken it easy on my kids... or ever! 

Well, tonight was our family game night, and we opted for monopoly.  Before we started, I basically told my wife “do not go easy on the kids.”  My wife basically responded with “whatever!” 

Quick note: we’ve played other games before and we’ve both have been guilty of being easy on the kids, but I think it was time to stop that practice. We’ve also played monopoly before but only on the Wii, so the kids know the basics of the game but we couldn’t really go easy when the system does everything for you (there were some tears shed quite often).  Tonight was the first time we were playing an actual old fashion board game as a family.  We have the Millennial Edition of monopoly and that’s just really boring! 

So during game play, my wife did exactly the opposite...she went extremely easy on our kids (9M and 6F), esp on our son!  When he landed on her spot with a hotel, the rent was suppose to be $1200, but he only had $300 and some property.  By the rules, he was suppose to sell/trade his property to raise the money he owes.  But...What does my wife do instead?  She tells him “just me $200.”  And this point, I protested saying that this isn’t part of the rules...my wife responded with  “shut up!”  When my daughter landed on my son’s property, she had to pay him $600 but again she didn’t have enough.  My wife...GAVE her the money to pay the rent.  And I protested and again my wife said “shut up!” 

Meanwhile, whenever anyone landed on my properties and it was my turn to collect rent, I wasn’t easy on anyone!  Which pissed off my wife a bit.  Again, last time I went easy on the kids and it turned out bad, so I didn’t this time round!

After the game was over (somehow the wife won), her and I had another talk.  I reminded my wife of the earlier conversation of not going easy, but she said “yes I know but mother instincts kick in and I have to protect my kids from being sad.”  I than bring up “how are they suppose to know the rules of the game or know the art of losing if you go easy on them?”  She tells me “stop being an AH and let me play with my kids the way I want to!”  Am I really the AH for telling her not to go easy on the kids?","YTA.

Monopoly, for good reason, is recommended for ages 8 and up. The 6 year old is too young to play and understand the game. If your wife went easy on her but hard on your son, she probably would feel like she is playing favorites. Let her play how she wants to play.

So I've been looking for a job and I eventually applied to this pet store that my family and I get our pet food from. I went through an interview and I think it went well, but the question of the drug test came up. I admitted to having THC in my system because I do smoke weed and told her I'm trying to stop. She asked me if I could pass a test in two weeks and I said ""Hopefully"". Then eventually the interview went on normally, she said she would contact me within the week, and we said our goodbyes.

So I've actually been wanting to cut back on smoking weed for a while, so I was up for the challenge, job or not. I actually lasted about 4 days (felt like forever, was hard af) but I eventually cracked and smoked due to stress from school and life and everything. I also started thinking negatively and thought they weren't going to call me back anyway. But turns out they actually did and asked if I was still interested in going forward. I said yes and she said they just need to do a background check and then the drug test. I agreed and then that was over. 

So After that, I started thinking. I literally cracked the day before, and thought about if I don't get the job because of that. This whole thing seems like a process..the interview, the background check, then the drug test, seems like its just a lot haha. I started thinking that maybe I should have just said no to moving forward because I couldn't even last two weeks without it, and to not get the job after all of this because of the drug test, I would just feel bad for wasting peoples time.

A=dads sister
U=dads brother
GP=dads dad
M=mom
D=dad

So my GP just passed away this week in a care home and his funeral is this Saturday or next week Saturday. He wasn’t doing well and his doctor had recently stopped him going to dialysis. Before going into a care home, M and my brother and I were taking care of him as well as M’s mom. This meant I had to stop going to college to take care of them so M could continue to work.

I took care of them for 3 years before M’s mom passed away then shortly afterwards my GP had a stroke and was put in a care home. He hated living here to be honest because he had to be taken care of by 2 women who are Japanese, me and M. 2 things which he hates. M didnt really want to take him in because he treated her like shit from before her and my dad were even married

Anyways, M and D’s side of the family told both U and A to fly over and come visit him before he gets worse or dies because they both lived in the mainland and hasn’t been back over 20+ years. She’s been back in the past 2 years only to discus the will and what’s gonna happen to the money after he passes. U and A finally decided to fly in this past week to see him one last time because we were told he would probably pass away soon. U couldn’t stay for very long, but A and her bf stayed for a week.

At first no one really wanted a funeral, it was too much money and so we were just going to have him 
Cremated and then buried because it was easier for everybody and then maybe have like a little get together with his family and friends afterwards. After we had left the crematorium/obituary people, M had left to go to work. Then A and D were talking and decided that they were going to have a funeral. M and D hadnt put money aside for a funeral so this is all just last minute. A and D came up with a rough estimate $1000 give or take. So they agreed to split it 3 Ways

A and her bf left town a day early to get to the other side of island because she didn’t want to leave early in the morning to catch her flight. meaning she would miss the meeting with the minister to figure out how much everything would be. The funeral service and the after party and other stuff. So far the total is roughly almost $2000 but We’re still not done with all the calculations

Now since were having a funeral, my parents decided to throw him a Buddhist funeral but on the minimalist side. A prayer and the minister will give him a Buddhist name and then someone will say a few words and done because my GP isn’t/wasn’t religious but my mom grew up that way.

So the funeral needs 4 bouquets of flowers and when M had told this to A, she had refused and said she’d only pay for 2 bouquets. And now shes saying that she’s only gonna put in $500 for the funeral that she wanted. Meaning U and my parents will now have to split the difference of her half

I was crushed, but she never mentioned it to me before. I was a bit suspicious, so I asked one of her other friends if G had a boyfriend. G's friend said she didn't. I then thought G didn't want to be friends with me, so I then avoided her for a week, because the way I saw it, she wanted to be left alone. After that, G texted me, asking what was going on. I told her that I thought she didn't want to be friends with me because she was always saying that she was busy, and she got really mad at me. She said that she was always really busy with studying for the SATs, and with track and field. I told her that I was really sorry for doing this, and asked her what I could do to fix this. She then told me to have a good night, and that I'd see her tomorrow.

&#x200B;

She hasn't talked to me since. I really want to date her, or be friends with her, even.

726,"WIBTA if I bought my boyfriend nicer & “younger” clothes? My BF (23M) and I (25F) have been dating for about 3 months. I would describe his style as “middle aged white dad.” Like his jeans are all light wash and too baggy, he always wears t-shirts from his favorite football team, and he has this baggy windbreaker that he always wears as a jacket.

I’ve never brought it up as an issue but we’re going to visit my friends for my birthday at the end of this month and I want to just buy him a few younger styled outfits that fit him so he’ll look better in our pictures and while we’re out with my friends. I’m thinking of getting 2 pairs of jeans, shoes that aren’t running shoes and maybe 2/3 polos or button up shirts.

But my sister (22F) thinks I’m being rude and I should like him no matter what he wears. She also pointed out that if my boyfriend told me what to wear I’d be very angry so there’s a double standard here.

727,"AITA for always giving my roommate the cold shoulder because of.... Her dirty/unpleasant habits. 

She shreds hair like a bear, never has the initiative to pick up/sweep her hair in the room and the bathroom. She is also an unorganized bathroom user. She leaves all her bottles scattered, and some soap suds are not watered all the way down the drain. I mean, isnt this just common courtesy for the next user?? 

Her dishes. Horrible. Flies come in our room ‘cause her dishes are left for 3 days. I come home late so i cant initiate washing, but she’s there as early as 6PM. And it’s HER dishes.

The microwave, gosh, it’s mine btw. When she eats her food, it has the tendency to splatter all over. She does not have the initiative to clean up after. There was a time when I came home to an unpleasant smell. I traced it going to the microwave, and to my surprise an oyster meat was freaking sitting there all weekend!! With molds!!! And again I come home late and eat dinner out 99% of the time, but I still clean the microwave since it’s mine and I spent for it.

Lastly, she’s fond of watching TV series on her laptop in full blast, even when im resting/sleeping. I work in a very toxic place, so i just want to rest (in peace, literally) when i go home. I hear war sounds and noisy angry movies (she likes these things) as I lie down on my bed. This is the point when I tell her to please turn down the volume as Im resting. She’ll agree but when she gets carried away after a few minutes, she blasts the volume again! And reacts with a shriek on every intense movie scene!

She’s 35 and Im 23, AITA for expecting her to be more mature by this time? I am not the type to call out (introvert issues) so i just express my disappointment thru silent treatment.

729,"Aita for not cutting my wedding list? I put a 2000$ deposit down on my wedding because my fiance and i found the place we liked. I placed the deposit because while i expected her dad to pay for the wedding per tradition, she insisted he was not paying and could not afford it. When we saw him and told him, he was actually offended that i put a deposit down and that my fiance expected someone else to pay for his daughters wedding. He said he would pay me back. I never asked for the money, but fast forward about 6 months- he still has never paid me back. Another payment is due and he is telling my fiance that i need to invite less people on my side because he is not paying for my mothers exchange student who has been living with us for 5 years and is kind of like family at this point. He spends time with my 95 year old grandfather every day to keep him company, he calls my parents mom and dad and is really an exemplary person. With this being said my family invite list is probably twice as big as hers, but i have a big family, it is what it is, plus, my family AND friend invite list put together vs her and her dads family AND friends invite list- the latter is a larger list. I do not have a single one of my personal friends on the invite list. The list is my family, my moms close friends who are like family (quite honestly couldnt care less about them) my fiances family, her friends, and her dads friends. Today my fiance attempted to tell me we needed to remove people from my side of the list to save money and i said absolutely not. I already asked my mother if there were people i could remove from her list and she said no these are people that have always been there for her and me, growing up coming to birthday parties and giving me presents for holidays my whole life. I said to my mother i dont even have any of my own friends coming to my own wedding and i couldnt invite more due to cost to my fiances father, to which she responded that she would pay for a table of 10 for my friends, instead of removing people from her list. So, AITA for refusing or should i tell my mom it is what it is and we are cutting people. If i do tell my mom we are cutting people she is just going to say she will pay for them, and i dont think my fiances dad will like that, but he also said he would reimburse me 2000$ and has not.


Edit: we did not ask my fiances dad to pay for the wedding. I thought he would due to being the brides dad, but my fiance said no and we went with it, no big deal. When he found out we picked a spot and i put a desposit down, he was offended that she expected someone else to pay and said he would pay for the wedding. Now he is telling her that i need to shorten my side.

732,"AITA for threatening to tell secrets about my sister Before I start the story I need to give a little backstory. This is my first reddit post ever so if I do something stupid my bad. Anyway, I joined color guard my freshman year. Usually when you are returning for the second year it is way less expensive because you already bought all your uniforms and stuff. My now ex-stepdad paid for all my stuff in freshman year, but when my mom was arrested I lost everything. I had to move in with my cousins two states away until my mom got out of jail. Now this year (sophomore year) my mom has to pay for everything. She constantly uses this to belittle me all the time and make me do everything around the house. Meanwhile my sister who is 11 has been in dancing since she was 5 and is way more expensive in the long run. End of back story.

My moms latest boyfriend is allergic to cats. I made a joke about how maybe he wouldn’t be allergic to cats and we should get one of those as a JOKE. I know we can barely afford it when we can barely afford rent every month. We paid with my color guard stuff with income tax, but in general we are very poor. We never have food at the house. Any my mom ended up calling me a spoiled brat because apparently I always want things I know are too expensive when my sister doesn’t get anything. Then my moms boyfriend went on a huge tangent about how I always make things seem worse then they are and that I crave sympathy. We live in a two bedroom house and I share a room with my sister and my moms boyfriends daughter. We also have two roommates who don’t even pay rent that live in the living room. Anyway, my moms boyfriend complained to the guy that was living with us about me for like 30 minutes including the phrase “if her mom wasn’t there I would have beat the shit out of her”. And I was shocked because I never heard him say something like that before so I told my sister. She agreed with everything the adults said and justified it by saying “you can’t hide from the truth”.

So i told her if the truth wasn’t bad I should be able to text her friends every bad thing she ever said about them. But in reality, I never really did that. All I did was hide her phone charger so she couldn’t have her phone for 2 weeks as her and I are the only people in the house with the same charger and I don’t let her use mine. My mom heard that I threatened to tell my sisters friends “lies that can get her harmed” and she turned my data off and didn’t let me got to my next color guard competition which could have gotten me kicked of rifle line.

Am I the asshole? 

Edit:
I’d like to say in case it isn’t that clear that I have a job and do help pay for my own stuff. My sister also has a tablet that our ex-stepdad bought her when he was still with my mom. I did not leave her without a device and she doesn’t have after school practices or anything like that so it’s not like I left her without a form of communication. It just seemed better then actually hurting her feelings if anything it would just annoy her.

735,"AITAH for demanding to eat out of KFC's Garbage Can? I was at a KFC/Taco Bell and it was exceptionally busy, there was a line out the door. While I was waiting in line apparently an elderly man grabbed an order that was not his and left. Around the same time that it was my turn to order the elderly man's order came to the counter. A guy grabbed it and took maybe two steps away from the counter, looked into the bag, and brought it back to the counter. He then very loudly and a bit aggressive threw it down and said ""That old man took my order."" I thought he was being unreasonable since the worker's didn't do anything wrong and I am sure they would just make the guys order again. Anyway, in the very small verbal spat one of the employees took the old mans food and threw it in the trash behind the counter. This trash can was admittedly very gross, it was overflowing and had sauce, and who knows what else caked all over it. However, the food was in a paperboard box and that box was in a plastic bag.

&#x200B;

So while placing my order I say ""I'll take that food that was just thrown out"". The cashier turns and looks at what I am pointing at and she gives me a look of pure discuss, and says ""That is in the trash."" I reply telling her it is fine, it is in a bag. We go back and forth a little, so I turn to the line behind me which can clearly hear the discussion, for a little backup. I look at the general crowd and say ""It's in a bag, there is nothing wrong with it, right?"". The people in the line looked completely mortified. One person actually said ""nasty!"". To keep it short, I went back and forth a little until this guy in the crowed said ""Just fucking order and move over"". I gave up.

736,"WIBTA for asking/telling my husband to not work nights? Tl;dr at the bottom

Last year my husband graduated in biology and has been working as a tech while he applies to a master's program. He is a hard worker and tries to make all the money he can so he immediately started working nights and working overtime. He worked the night shift on the surgical floor for 16 months, and during that time I got pregnant and had our first baby. He didn't take time off when I had her, but because full time is three 12 hour shifts a week, he was able to arrange his schedule so he'd have a few days off after I had her.
It turns out having a newborn is hard af, especially with PPD and a husband on nights, so I encouraged him to switch to days. A spot opened up in the ER (where he had been wanting to work) and it was for mids (11am to 11pm) and he took it.
He's been on this new shift for just over a month and doesn't like it. He says that his co-workers have been really difficult to get along with and that he's been called out at work when he's there busting his butt. I asked him to give it a try for 6 months because it is SO much better for me and the baby, and he said he would.
However, today when he was at work, he texted me saying that he got offered the same position but on the night shift, and he took it.. he said that he tried days, didn't like them, and is excited to get back on nights.
And I'm over here like.. what? That wasn't our agreement! I thought after 6 months we could discuss it again and see what we thought would both work. I feel like telling him he needs to go back and say ""sorry, I changed my mind, I'm staying on days"" but I don't want him to hate his job. He works hard and works a lot so I do want him to be happy there.
When he was working nights I felt like I never saw him, and I felt like I was drowning with having to care for our baby. I know he will keep doing overtime and I know I'll hardly see him once he starts nights again. WIBTA if I ask him to suck it up and work with the difficult co-workers on days so that our daughter and I can see him more?

746,"WIBTA For Calling Out Pan-Handlers? I commute daily through one of the busy train stations in the United States,  Penn. Station in New York. The station is a large public space that is warm during the winter, which means that many homeless people sleep there during the winter. While some of these people are there to get a cheap meal, or sleep, or use the bathroom, some are also there to solicit kind donations from commuters.

To be clear, I have problem with giving people money if they truly need it, but since I in the station every day, I have noticed some suspect pan-handlers who I think are exploiting people's  goodwill. I see some of these people tell the same sob story everyday such as being short for a fare to get home. I see people give them the money that exceeds covering the alleged fare, and they proceed to walk up to someone else and tell them the same story. I have also been confronted by someone asking for change, only to look down at his feet and notice that he was wearing $200 shoes! When these people walk into the train car that I'm sitting in, I want to warn people that these people are disingenuous and that they should save their money for the ACTUAL homeless people populating the station, or instead of giving money, buy them a meal or the train ticket they are asking for.

747,"AITA for how I spoke to the woman who we traded seats with on a long flight, so me and my wife could sit together? So, me and my wife just flew across the US after a New Years' vacation. We tried to check in to our flight as early as possible, but missed our alarm while on a subway train, and 15 minutes after we were allowed to check in, there were no more seats on the airplane next to each other. There were only two seats in the same row, one window seat and one aisle seat.

I figured it would be fine, since almost everyone prefers an aisle seat to a middle seat, and nobody likes being talked past by strangers on a flight, so we should have no problem asking the person stuck between us to switch to the aisle so that we could sit together. We were also downright exhausted after the trip so we'd planned on one of us being able to sleep a little bit by leaning against the side of the plane.

We board the plane and get to our row, and there's a woman sitting in the middle seat already.

She looks pissed that she has to get up to let one of us past, and while she's preparing to get up, my wife says ""actually we were wondering if you'd be okay maybe taking the aisle seat instead of the middle so that we could sit together?""

She looks taken aback, pauses for a second, and then says ""I'll take the window seat.""

My wife says ""We were hoping for the window seat, is it okay if you take the aisle instead?""

She says ""No, I'd prefer the window seat.""

At this point the stress of dealing with all the travel probably got to me and I said, pretty curtly, ""well, would you rather sit between us for the whole flight instead?""

Equally curtly, she says ""sure, if that's what you want.""

I decided not to push it any further and said ""fine, take the window seat.""

(I know these sentences might not seem rude on their own but both me and the woman we were talking to were definitely talking in a stressed tone that indicated displeasure.)

She just sits in her middle seat looking at me for a few seconds and then says ""so are you making me get up or what?""

I said ""you can have the window seat, that's fine.""

So she shakes her head and scoffs and gets up and sits in the window seat, taking her sweet time about it.

She then shuts both of the blinds on the airplane windows in our row and makes like she's going to sleep. This plane has a dimmer for the windows, so she could've put it very dim but where we could still see out a little, but opted instead to set both windows to fully blacked out.

I know I have no right to expect someone to voluntarily exchange seats on our behalf when we don't have it reserved. But I also feel like most people sitting in a middle seat would rather take either the window or the aisle. She still did us a favor, but being able to switch to the aisle is also a perk so accepting that trade still a nice way to meet someone in the middle (no pun intended). I also feel like there might have been an element of vindictiveness in fully dimming both windows without asking us.

(We are in the UK. 4 = C, U i think means ungraded/not attempted.)

My mum and I have tried every way we could possibly think of to help him, or to understand why he is struggling with going to school and why his grades are so low. He gives us nothing back, his answers to every question is “I dont know” or some other sarcastic remark. My mum is extremely soft with him because in the past, maybe 2 years ago he was depressed. Not clinically diagnosed, but he was hurting himself for a brief period of time. He didn’t respond to therapy. Then he all of a sudden he was as happy as can be, friends over all the time, confidence overflowing. Since then he gets away with EVERYTHING, with maybe a “stern” talking to, if anything, because my mum doesn’t want to be the reason he goes back to where he was. She was NEVER that soft with me (22F) but thats another topic for another day.

So since we tried talking to him, we tried asking him if there was ANY possible way we could help, we tried going to the doctors, we tried seeking help from his school teachers, we came  up with a week-by-week revision schedule with all three of us working together to improve his grades - he isn’t interested. nothing is helping the situation.

755,"AITA wanting mutual consideration? A lady friend I've known for over a year accompanied me to vacation resort (my treat) in June. She also agreed to accompany me on a road-trip to Montana in September. It had been 6 weeks since our last conversation (we're 900 miles apart) and when I sent a text a few days ago reminding her, she acted surprised to hear from me. She said she was working and will call me at 7:30p when she gets home. At 7:30 no call, 8:30 no call and I sent a text saying I'll call. No response, so at 9:30 I call a full voice-mail box. I didn't want to assume she was flaking on me so the next day (18 hours later) I sent a text wishing her luck with the emotional issue preventing her from calling me. 16 hours later, still no call but a text telling me I was judgmental because her cousin needed her more than calling me to ""catch up"". She also tells me everyone comes to her with their problems and she should charge for being a shrink. This is now two days after she said she would call me. I text her that there was nothing judgmental and I just wanted her to be considerate about keeping her word. I also told her if she's too busy, maybe we shouldn't remain friends. BOOM! She says I'm being a judgmental asshole to the only person willing to keep a decent relationship with me, and she was helping her cousin out with a problem so I can cram it up my ass! Huh?! Game over, I replied simply. Okay. 
If it makes any difference, it cost me $2.5K for her part of the vacation. I never said a word about it because I had a good time even though she friend-zoned me.","You're an asshole.

First, you assume she must have an ""emotional issue"" because she didn't call you. If she didn't call you when she said she would she's busy. Give the lady a day to catch up with stuff instead of accusing her of ""emotional issues""...that is definitely judgmental.

And then, a day later...all of this is taking space *within 24 hours*....you declare you shouldn't be friends with her because she didn't call you one night because she had other issues. Your asshole has now grown its own asshole, if you will. She is allowed to have a life outside of you without you declaring that you can't be friends because she won't drop everything the minute you demand it.

And you finally put the cherry on the sundae of assholeness by making it clear by the use of the word ""Friend-zone"" that all of this ""being friends"" stuff is bullshit...you just want to get in her pants and by not promptly responding to your beck and call, she has thwarted that.",1,YTA,0.0,0.0,0
760,"AITA for reporting a group of girls in my class for being excludatory to myself and others I'm a 19 year old college student studying art & design. It's a small class with under 20 students, most of whom are female. There are only 3 guys in the whole class, one of which is myself. Over time the class has naturally divided into 2 separate social groups. One one table there is a group of girls and 2 guys who are quite studious/quiet, they tend to just get on with their work. On the other table there's another all female social group who are very boisterous and chatty. I sit on the edge of this table.

Now, the girls on my table are by all means not awful people. However, being the only guy on the table I have noticed that they treat me significantly differently.

With each other, they're always joking around and having banter, spouting memes and generally goofing off. Whenever I interact with them, they are friendly and polite, but they don't have any banter with me. It's like they think I'm incapable of having fun, when in fact that's my EXACT sense of humor and pretty much how I am with my bros.

Another thing I noticed is that with each other they talk about movies and video games, two things I'm really interested in. Not once have they spoken about those things with me. Usually they will only talk to me about classwork. I also noticed that I seem to cease to exist when they're all present, but if only one of them is in early or something, and I'm the only available option, THEN they'll talk to me.

They very rarely interact with the two guys on the other table either. To me it definitely comes across like they dislike us just because of gender.

I recently started feeling more and more excluded when I would hear the girls on my table talking about stuff in their group chat (which I'm not a member of), and hearing about them hanging out outside of class and having all these inside jokes I can't understand.

So, that brings us to monday of this week. I arranged to have a meeting with our main tutor after class, in which I basically told him everything I've written here. He pretty much said there isn't much he can do in a situation like this because he can't force friendships. He said the only time he can really get involved is if there is actual bullying going on.

I then asked the question ""Is socially isolating somebody to the point where they want to drop out of college considered bullying?""

He said yes it would be, so I said that would mean I am being bullied. My tutor said he would then have a talk with the girls on my table, and I went home feeling better about the situation.

Turns out I shouldn't have felt better because now things are worse. When I came in the next day I was ignored completely. They don't even attempt to talk to me anymore. I also get the impression that they're constantly laughing at me in their group chat.

I've spoken to a friend about the situation and he said I should never have gone to my tutor about it. I disagree and think it was worth a shot, but I'm open to other perspectives.

A woman (who I thought was a flight attendant) came over and started making comments on the backpack, saying it shouldn’t be in the overhead when there are larger bags that needed space. She then proceeded to ask who owned the bag and my husband responded. I could see that another passenger had a large bag that needed the space and my husband was raising his voice so I defused the situation by agreeing to put the bag under our front seat. After she left, my husband muttered “bitch” about her under his breath and I said “hey!” (shocked that he would say that about a flight attendant) and then “she’s kind of right, you shouldn’t be putting your backpack in the overhead” and he got angry at me for not supporting him.

768,"AITA for continuing my run after a friend gets hurt I've run on aggressive trails for a decade. My main man, ""Pumpkin,"" who is also a seasoned trail runner, was visiting me over Thanksgiving. I have a local friend, ""Bill,"" who started running recently, sticking to treadmills and roads. I introduced him to trail running (we've run together 3 times) a few weeks ago.

Pumpkin and Bill come to my house to run while Bill's and my wife go shopping. The day before Bill and I ran 10 miles, which was his longest run thus far (read: he was fatigued). The three of us head to a local trail network that has about 16 miles of technical routes. We decided to do about 8 miles.

A mile into our run Bill goes down on a root. He's grabbing his ankle, which is swelling, and he's clearly in pain. He runs internal diagnostics to determine the damage. No one here is a doctor, but Pumpkin and I have had serious running injuries. After a while Bill is able to stand, put weight on his injured foot, and limp. His run is clearly done.

Here's where I think ITA. We determine Bill can walk back to the trailhead. Pumpkin and I sprint to the car (a mile away) to pickup Bill midway. Pumpkin or I should have walked with him while the other got the car.

We meet him at the trailhead. Bill debates going straight to the doctor, and I tell him I'll drive him anywhere he wants. Sadly, his wife took their car keys so he's dependent on someone else. I drive to my house and Pumpkin and I get him settled with his foot elevated with an ice pack, drinks, snacks, and the remote. He's adamant Pumpkin and I finish our run, so we shorten our planned distance and I tell him I'll take him anywhere he wants to go when we return.

At my house alone, Bill is diagnosing himself via WebMD. Pumpkin and I were confident it's a bad sprain and tried to him convince him before leaving. Bill texts his wife, who is an hour away, that he is concerned it is broken and she considers going back to my house before they can get any shopping done. Bill's wife is being driven by my wife with our baby in the car.

She suggests he reach out to a friend who lives 45 minutes away to take him to the doctor's, which he does. I do not have my phone on me during this time.

Pumpkin and I return about an hour after dropping Bill off and learn he's been taken to the doctor's by the friend who drove 1.5 hours to do so. I text Bill and tell him I'll pick him up from the doctors and take him to lunch after he's done. Like any emergency visit, it takes hours. His wife returns and joins him.

He has a mild-to-moderate sprain with an air cast and must rest for at least a week. Full recovery expected within 2-3 weeks.

My wife claims Pumpkin and I have no emotional intelligence and should have stayed with him. It is his first running injury and he has only been to our house 3 times prior. She also says we should have kept our phones on us during the run.

My perspective is I gave Bill multiple options and he chose to hang out at my house while we finished the run.

772,"Aita for telling my boss to not hire someone I had an affair with years ago? A few years ago, I had a brief affair. (For this part, IATA, I know) My SO and I did counseling, had some tough discussions, and they forgave me. Fwiw, it wasn’t a physical affair, but an emotional one. I did approach the fling about having a physical relationship, but they didn’t commit. (Again, I know IATA for this). 
I did cut off all contact with the fling. 

Fast forward to the present day; my boss introduced me to an interviewee. It’s the fling from years ago. Shit. Just shit. I said hello and went back to work. 

I do not have a poker face. Later my boss asked me what the deal was with my reaction. I told them I knew the person from years ago and I’d be uncomfortable working with them. The boss asked why and I told them it wasn’t a work related reason. 

The next day, the boss asks me again about the interview and what the issue was. I felt cornered and caved and told them that it was because the interviewee cheated with a married person that I once worked with.  I implied that the coworker told me about it, that it wasn’t just gossip. (It was also somewhat true; the fling had told me about being involved with a coworker of theirs previously).  The boss thanked me for sharing what I knew and said that cheating was a reflection of poor character.

774,"AITA for yelling at my mom when she turned entertainment into education? One of my favourite things to do is to sit down with my family and watch our favourite show together, whatever that show may be at the time. But lately, my enjoyment has been uncertain because of a bad habit that one of my moms seems unable to do. What she does is she makes a remark, usually beginning with a ""You know..."" or a ""You boys realize that..."" when basically anything happens on the show. For example, we were watching Netflix's Sex Education and she immediately started going on about finding the right person, whether that's a male or female, and other topics of the sort. For the third time.

She has been using the nightly family routine as a way to teach my brother and I things that we have been taught many years prior, and she has been doing it for at least two years now. Each time, both my brother and I kindly tell her to please stop and that it hurts the experience of watching the show. She always says sorry and relents but then does it again, often on the same episode. I've dealt with it every time before, but a few days ago I lost my patience. 

The four of us, my brother, her, my other mom and me, were watching the new Stranger Things together and it reached the point where some characters had a strained romantic relationship. She started to talk about how to treat your partner, not for the first time, and I flipped. I paused the show and (loudly) told her that I was sick of her trying to shove a lecture into something I really liked doing, and admittedly said some things that were just there to make her feel more guilty instead of actually having their own points. When I finished she was silent for a while and then started to apologize, saying how she only was trying to prepare my brother and me for our future and how she thought the setting would be a good way to teach us naturally. She was crying. I immediately felt terrible, and told her that I overreacted but I was still tired of the behaviour.

We ended up finishing the episode and we had a good time. The rest of the family felt that I was really too harsh and that she meant no harm.

776,"AITA for not wanting to compost or empty the compost? I have a roommate in a city that's big on green initiatives. I personally don't like to compost for a slew of really small reasons listed below. I don't have a ton of compostable waste, but when I do I almost always put in the garbage disposal or the trash. However, I feel obligated by my roommate to compost and to empty the compost as it is a shared apartment resource. I want to do neither of these things.

For reference, here are the (I told you, small) reasons I don't compost:

* It smells bad, and makes the kitchen smell bad
* It's a tiny little compost bin so it fills up extremely quickly (compostable to-go containers can fill the entire thing basically)
* Emptying it involves an elevator ride down 5 floors and out of the apartment complex
* I cannot (easily?) carry the compost, trash, and recycling at the same time -- at some point its excessive
* Compost is the only one that has to be taken back up to the apartment, so I can't just do it on my way out the door
* You have to clean the bin. It's gross enough when there's food inside, but I really hate cleaning the sloppy goop afterward
* You have to lift the lid, so we keep it on the counter and not under the sink. We're already limited on counter space and I don't want to look at it anyway.
* (Assuming the previous points for why I don't compost) I don't feel like I should empty it if I don't use it

This is essentially a ""WIBTA"".)","You would be kind of an asshole for refusing to participate at all, but since your roommate cares more than you do, you can negotiate your role in this, and maybe they can do most of the emptying and cleaning while you just put food scraps in there, and take care of something else like the trash or recyclables. 

To clarify, it sounds like you're collecting food scraps for compost, not actually processing compost in your home, yes? Collecting the food scraps shouldn't be a difficult process, you can get a bin that keeps the smells in, line it with biodegradable bags, rinse it out in the sink between uses, and when needed, fill it with hot water and Oxyclean and let it sit, which should kill any odor-causing bacteria and mold.",1,YTA,0.0,0.0,1
778,"WIBTA for wearing something similar to the bride's outfit at a wedding? My boyfriend's friend is getting married. Because she's so... unique... she's decided to have a floral/pastel wedding in the middle of a New England autumn. Because she's apparently a control freak, all guests must adhere to the wedding color scheme. I *hate* floral patterns and have been going absolutely nuts trying to find a dress I like (and would preferably wear again). It's been hell.

Well I finally found a dress. It's a nice pastel blue and lacy. I love lace. *Buuuuut*.... it doesn't have sleeves. Remember, this is going to be New England fall. As in it could very easily be very cold. So I went in search of a sweater to go on top. I settled for a simple white cardigan. I figure my ""flower"" aspect can be a necklace or barrette or something.

So I'm showing my outfit to my sister who happens to be the maid of honor. She likes it but mentions that its very similar in concept to the bride's wedding dress. Apparently the bride is wearing a lace white dress with blue under layers. So yes... it's not the exact same but it's similar. My mind immediately jumped to me being ""that woman."" You know the one. The one the bridesmaids talk about, the bride fears, and someone plots to spill red wine on.

I'm pretty sure I'm overthinking this. My sister says it's fine since none of the other guests know about the dress and I shouldn't be expected to either. But I do know because she told me. That would morally put me in the wrong if this is an asshole move. But is it?

EDIT: well good morning Reddit. Let me address a couple things.

First, I’m getting a lot of comments saying I’m arguing back. Maybe it came across that way. I was simply responding to new messages as they popped up before I went to bed. I guess doing that over and over again to the few comments at the time would look like arguing to people who came later. I didn’t meant to come across that way. I was simply clarifying because in my mind, not everybody comes back to posts they comment on if they don’t get a reply. My bad. I’ll stop responding to everybody. 

Second, yes... my first few sentences about the bride are pretty harsh. Again, tone over the Internet is not my friend. My unique comment was about the fact that the bride is both insisting on a spring themed wedding and an autumn date in a part of the country it will be cold and dark. That doesn’t line up to me. If you want a spring wedding have a spring date. As for calling her a control freak, you’re right. I’m a bit salty about the dress code. I’ve never had a bride tell me what to wear outside of a level of formality. I thought it was weird to begin with. I also hate dresses and shopping in general so this was already going to be unpleasant for me. But to top it off, I hate the colors and patterns she picked out. So yeah, I was a bit harsh in my words. But that’s because I’m exasperated at this point and it was late at night after going back and forth about “what do you think of x combination or y combination” with people. I don’t like shopping. I don’t like fashion. This has been hard for me. But you’re right. I’ve always believed a bride has a right to have her wedding the way she wants. I just let my frustration cloud that this time. 

Third, the resounding verdict is that not only would be but I currently am an asshole for even entertaining this thought. I can accept this judgement. The whole reason I made this post is because I have this huge fear of sticking out and/or ruining the night. The whole “bride wearing blue” thing is throwing me off! I know it’s tradition to not wear white but the brides not wearing only white. I am in societal norm hell right now. 

The whole point of this is that I DONT want to make the asshole mistake. I’ve been deeply analyzing every outfit option I find. “Is it on theme enough?” “Will I stick out?” Etc etc. I’ve run each outfit by a lot of people to get a wide range of options. The only one I got a unanimous “yes that works” on is the outfit above. But that didn’t sit right with me. So I came to reddit because you say it like it is. You’ve confirmed my fears, pretty loudly.

This friend is important to me, I'm involved in their life at this point, as I know all their friends, people they've dated, places they've been recently, even though we haven't been friends for very long.

&#x200B;

That friend revealed to me that they were pregnant recently, though I've had suspicions mounting over the past few weeks. They got back together with a male ex, they've been complaining about back pain and nausea, looking for a better paying job, etc. I had to ask them up front because they didn't tell me when they found out about two weeks ago. I don't have very many details on the matter, other than they seem utterly distraught over the whole situation, and that the girl they were seeing broke up with them.

&#x200B;

The problem is, pregnancy and children are the two things that cause panic attacks in me. Even writing the word gives me stomach cramps that last for hours or cold sweats that linger. I have a phobia, to the point where I considered drastic measures when I had a pregnancy scare about half a year ago. I do my best in public, but it almost always comes with sweating or vomiting or a breakdown afterward.

&#x200B;

This friend has told me that they are depending on me for emotional support while their life is in shambles, and I've tried my best to comfort them over the phone, via texts, or personal visits. But it's taken a toll on me. All they talk about with me now is their pregnancy, how hard it is, how their life is ruined, and it's getting to a point where I'm becoming so overwhelmed with it all that I start getting stomach cramps whenever I've seen that they've messaged me.

&#x200B;

I haven't told them about my phobia; I intended to before, but now I feel as though it would be selfish to do so. Pregnancy is an enormous amount of stress, and I know it's the most important thing in their life right now. I feel like, my stupid phobias seem meager and unimportant. I've rarely discussed it with people in the past, if they have had children or are around children, and normally just slowly evaporated from that person's life to avoid causing them trouble. I've been considering doing the same with this friend, lessening our contact more and more until it's minimal, before vanishing entirely. They'll have a child that I will fear coming into contact with despite the enormous amount of therapy I've been through to ease the problem. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR: A close friend of mine is pregnant, and I have a debilitating phobia of children and pregnancy as a concept. I haven't told them about my phobia and they've told me they're relying on me right now for emotional support. Am I the asshole for considering ghosting them?","YTA, address your phobia; like seriously see a mental health professional because this will affect your life negatively. 

Pregnancy and children is a normal part of life and the older you get the more people in your social circle will start having kids.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with not having children your self, or even avoiding events where there might be a lot of children present.  But its unrealistic to expect every close friend to remain childfree forever.

Edit: I will also point out that I dislike children, and avoid interacting with them when possible, but dropping a friendship entirely is going too far.",1,YTA,0.0,0.0,0
784,"AITA for showing my displeasure at being pressured to move to a different seat at a restaurant? One of my favorite things to do to get it out of the house, is to grab a notepad for writing, my phone for redditing, and post up at one of the many popular diners here in town. I stay awhile, do some creative writing, enjoy some people watching, and tip generously.

There was way more people there than usual on this particular day. With a line out of the door, the wait was going to be 45 minutes easy.

When I asked for a table for one, the host politely requested I take a seat at the bar. The bar is not a great here as there's only 5 seats and you're crammed with the staff. There was one seat available in the middle, with two guys to the left and two girls to the right. I figured if I take up a whole table to myself, that's kinda rude to the people coming up behind me, so I concede and take the middle seat at the bar.

About 10 minutes in, I'm enjoying my coffee, doing some writing, and doing well to not get too distracted. Until I noticed a guy standing over my left shoulder, between myself and the other two guys at the bar. He's hovering pretty strongly. One of the guys to my left gets his bill and as he's about to pay, I hear this hovering guy say on his phone, ""Yeah, there's three spots at the bar. I'm about to get them."" I'm thinking to myself, ""Oh, he sees I don’t have any food and thinks I’m about to leave.""

So, I turn to him and say, ""I'm going to be awhile, I'm not leaving soon."" He's confused, the he motions to the girls to my right and the one on the far right was now about to start paying for her meal. He then speaks, addressing me and the girl immediately to my right who isn't finished with her meal, ""Y’all can move down one, right?""

What he doesn't know is that the two girls came together and he misjudged that I was alone.  The girl to my right gave a weird look and nothing was said as a follow-up.  I just went back to my coffee and writing, trying to block him out. I'm thinking he'll just go back to the host and get on the waiting list now.

Well, 10 or 15 minutes later, I'm starting to wind down. The guy has taken the two seats to my left and the girls to my right have just left. It takes me a minute or two to realize that the new guy who showed up to take the seat to my right was the third guy in their group. All of the conversation stops between them and they are all staring at me. I'm starting to get pissed now and once again, Hover Man chimes in, ""You can move down now, right?""

At this point I'm feeling like I'm going to go full Larry David on this whole situation, but I bite my tongue, make it clear in my attitude that I'm pissed off at the situation, and move to my right.

It's obvious that they believed I was the asshole for not conceding to whatever game of musical chairs they needed me to do so that their group of three could sit together at this 5 -seat bar. And here I am thinking they’re assholes, for saving seats and pressuring someone to move from their seat instead of waiting to get a table like everyone else.

What say you?","YTA. Moving down a seat at the bar is such a minor inconvenience, most people would reasonably expect you to do it to accommodate a larger group. Also why do you go to busy restaurants to do your creative writing and people watching? I'm guessing they would much rather you don't tie up a table or bar seat for 2 hours by yourself regardless of how generously you tip.",1,YTA,0.0,0.0,0

So my friend invited me over to his dorm to cook with him, he picked me up because he lives on the opposite side of campus. and even with layers of jackets walking outside was literally a nightmare because it was like -15 out and we had CRAZY high winds. after we parked we had to walk for 4 minutes to get to his dorm and when i got to his dorm i felt like i was freeze dried. 

When he drove me back, I noticed a guy walking from the off-campus apartments to another area on campus which would of been a 12-15 minute walk outside, he didn’t look like he had a lot of money and wasn’t wearing a jacket or any gear to keep warm, he was only wearing jeans and a hoodie and some sneakers. he literally could lose his limbs from the temperature.

799,"AITA for tipping the pizza delivery person? When I got home from work today, I decided to treat myself and order pizza for dinner tonight.  There was a nice deal for a pizza, side and 2-liter, and with the tax and delivery fee, the total came to $24.29.

I've ordered from this company several times before, and in spite of the fact that the store is less than a mile away, it almost always takes at least an hour for the food to actually arrive.  I generally don't mind because it's still reasonably warm and is within the time frame for me to eat dinner, but the delay is definitely noticeable.

Anyway, I was paying by card, and there was an option to tip the deliver person, so I figured I'd go ahead and round the bill up to $25.00.  The deliver person (male, 20-24ish) arrived approximately an hour and twenty minutes after I received my order confirmation, and handed everything over.  However, after I said thanks and went to shut the door, he mumbled something, put my receipt on the pizza box, and then put three quarters on the box before turning and walking away.

I couldn't hear what he had said, and my initial reaction was to think that they had somehow overcharged my card on accident.  But after a few seconds, I realized that he was essentially rejecting my tip.

800,"AITA for not liking my supportive parent because of their political opinions. I am battling a pretty unheard of, yet highly stigmatised disease.
It has left me disabled and I am often bedbound and unable to care for myself.
I live in a country with state health care.
An election is coming up and my parent has been very vocal about the party they will vote for. This is a political party with a history of discriminating against people with my condition.

We are currently fighting a legal battle bc this government intentionally sponsored flawed medical research.
This led to the government requiring us to undergo dangerous treatment, often in order to receive state welfare.
This treatment has been heavily criticised by independent medical professionals: it actively makes the condition worse in most cases.
This has impacted me personally as I was required to follow this treatment for a year until it literally broke my body. 
My parent helped me through that and saw first hand what it did to me. Yet still supports the political party behind this.

Secondly the UN has published a report showing that this government is systematically failing the rights of people like me who are disabled and actively discriminateagainst us.
This mirrors my experience and challenges with accessing basic healthcare, medicines, and care.
My parent has been through all of this struggle with me and has agreed that the government is discriminatory and is impacting disabled rights. 
Yet they still support this political party

My parent has seen me fighting for months on just to receive access to basic medical care.
They have seen me being discharged from services bc my condition is 'too severe' for local services.
There is only one option for treatment available now, which I will only be able to access if funding for it is approved.
We have been told that if the health budget is cut, it is likely my treatment will not be funded. 
Despite this being my only option, my parent still supports the ONLY political party who proposes a reduction in funding for state health care.

My parent has spent an uncountable number of nights awake with me while I scream pain with my disease. They know I have PTSD from the amount of pain I'm in. They have been there through really dark times.

I have never told my parent who to vote for.
But that it will affect my feelings.
I love my parent, but I do not like them as a person because of their politics. My parent says that I am in the wrong for this.

I accept the fact that they support me financially, and that this proves that they do love me. I believe they do. 
But I think that if you vote for a party who reduce my care, rights and quality of life then it shows your priorities.
 I feel horrible and guilty and dirty for not liking my own parent. They feed me and put a roof over my head and aside from this have been supportive.

805,"AITA for being upset my son changed his last name to his step-father's last name without telling me? I will admit, I was never the best father to my oldest son, Josh. When he was little, I was an alcoholic and fought with his mother constantly. Never anything physical, but he grew up with a lot of yelling and arguing and unfortunately finding me passed out in a drunken stupor many times. When he was about 5, I had an affair with another woman which eventually lead to a child being born. I ended up leaving my wife and starting a family with her and the child I had with her, Ben. It was then when I found god and got sober. Got a good job opportunity and moved a few states over. I tried to see Josh as much as I could, usually a few times a year and some holiday’s. My ex-wife was nothing but supportive about him visiting me, I just wish I could have done it more. My ex remarried a few years later to a nice man, and I know he and Josh got very close over the years.

For Christmas when Josh was 15, he came to visit me, my wife and his brother. It was then he had came out to me as gay – and I did not react the way I should have. At that point in my life, I had found Christianity and it was tethered to keeping me sober – and unfortunately I bought into a lot of the anti-gay sentiments my local church used to preach. I don’t visit that church anymore. For about two years we cut contact but I came to realization that I was wrong and I begged my son for forgiveness. He forgave me and we tried to regain the father/son relationship, although the distance being a few hours away didn’t help. We still would only see each other a couple times a year.

My son is now 21 and for this last Father’s Day, he surprised his step dad with a legal name change, changing his last name to match his step father’s. When I heard this, my feelings were crushed. He had not even contacted me for Father's Day. I knew that he and his step dad were close but I didn't think he would ever change his name. The next time I saw him, I asked him about it – why he didn’t at least give me a heads up. He told me that while he does forgive me for my past actions; he does not see me as a father figure and that his step father was always there for him. When I mentioned that he now didn’t have the same last name as his brother, he said he didn’t really care about that as he and his brother admittedly are not close.

I was crushed and angry. I contacted my ex and told he how upset I was with this and how I would have appreciated a heads up from her. She said she had nothing to do with his decision and that he came to her having already decided to change his name. I feel really bitter and resentful; I don’t even know where my relationship with my son will go from here now. I know I wasn’t the best father but I don’t know if I really deserve this? I feel like I should have had a heads up he was changing his name, instead of hearing about it after the fact. AITA here?

**EDIT**: Reading the replies has really opened my eyes. My anger and resentment is misplaced and is coming from a place of complete guilt. I'm not angry or resentful of my son, I'm angry at myself for my past actions but my ego is making it feel otherwise. I'm currently writing a letter to my son's step father thanking him for being there for my son. I'm also going to apologize to my ex for blaming her for this because that was not right. I never brought any of this up to my son - after he gave me his explanation I stayed quiet. I know I've been a terrible father for most of his life - I hope even if he doesn't see me as a father figure, we can have a good relationship as an adult.

We have not had the greatest relationship, with lots of stressors, bad luck and hard times the last three years in particular. We have both gained weight, each about 40-50 lbs, over the last year and a half or so. When I finally weighed myself for the first time in forever about a month ago I was disgusted with myself and started making changes to lead a healthier life including jogging in the mornings, cutting out fast food, eating more fruits and veggies, etc. My SO recently said seeing me going out and jogging has made him feel motivated to start running too as he frequently makes comments lamenting his own weight gain (“I’m fat” or “oh I’m getting fat”) in a self-pitying type of way. However he has this pattern of feeling pumped to workout for like a week and then gives up and stops, and I have yet to see him make any dietary changes. 

That brings us to tonight. While eating dinner, our 4 year old asked for more of the cheesy potato casserole we had to which I told her she needed to eat more chicken before getting more. SO hears us and says “oh it’s all gone.” After I had gotten food for myself and our girls there was still about half of the casserole dish worth of food left and he apparently took it and ate it all, not eating any of the veggies that we also had with dinner.

Was out last night with her friends (guys/girls) and bantering with some of the guys when some of her friends approached us. Now, most of this group of people are educated, have real careers, homeowners, etc. Largely beyond the age of putting a lot of stock into the hip social causes (eg: we dont care about this trans rights stuff going on, but it seems to be a hot topic with teens who have time for that stuff). But two of her friends are stuck in that 18-22 life and inject it into everything (cant blame them if that's all thats going)

One of the girls starts loudly announcing she's leaving to meet a guy she’s going to sleep with. All good. But she wouldn't shut up about how this guy is 1 of 5 she's currently banging. Bragging like a high school guy does when he's got two girls going at once. Since all the dudes in the group are top-tier at banter, we were egging her on telling her shit like ""If you bang a different dude every day of the week you get a plaque from the Canadian Association for Functional Whores"". She was loving it, laughing, and taking it in stride. But after she left the two girls who havent moved on from that early 18-22 of life (they still work retail/minimum wage, attend rallys, post politics on social media constantly, etc) started a hubbub saying we were all a bunch of sexist pigs

We laughed it off to them to begin with but then they started raising their voices saying that shaming women for sex is backwards, Trump encourages this (weird since we live in Canada), and just spewing lines that I've literally read on this website line for line, like they were just repeating stuff. It was strange since the girl we were chatting with was laughing WITH us. At some point in this exchange she directed a question/statement at me along the lines of ""You wouldn't break up with [gf] if you found out she had slept with 100 guys before you, so why would say that stuff?"" To which I told her I would break up with her if I found out that she had slutted it up before dating me, and she had lied to me about the notches on her belt (gf slept with ~20 guys before me, and I slept with ~40 before her and we are fine with this). She blew up at us and a buddy said ""hey we were just shooting the shit with her boys will be boys"". Which was the wrong thing to say as ""boys will be boys"" is a sexist phrase. It was so fucking weird, one of these cringey comment threads where people bitch about feminism or misogyny but in real life. I was very unprepared to find out that those kind of people really exist and act like they do online.

Then there's your jokes. You're NTA for making sexist jokes in jest and fun that were well received ... but then they're only really fully jokes if you *don't* believe in what you're saying. And you proceeded when challenged to say that you wouldn't date your girlfriend if she had slept with more men before you, showing that actually you do believe that women ""whoring it around"" gives them less value.

And on top of all that, you seem genuinely confused about why your girlfriend might not be talking to you after you publicly announced to her friends that your relationship with her wouldn't exist if she had ""slutted it up"" before she met you. Like ... wow, son.

My wife of 6 years and I recently moved out onto some land, that is a couple hours away from our friends. I've been having some doubts about our relationship and I think I'm in love with my Ex. My wife is away (back in town) for the weekend, staying with her best friends. I'm drunk and broken up over it, but I wonder if I should tell her while she's there and has the support of her friends, instead of at our home where she would be alone.

I feel like she deserves better than me. We are in an open relationship and she does not care that I have been spending time with and sexually involved with my ex, but I don't think she has any idea that I am falling in love with another woman.

827,"AITA for signing up on a survey site without my cousins permission? So I’m a 19M living with my 22F cousin. She’s very protective over her number and her contact details and life in general because she’s afraid of random guys sliding into her dm or something.

So I was on this survey site. I needed thirty dollars on the survey site to finally check out. I was on 29 dollars. Each referral gives you a dollar.

For the weeks before then I had half heartedly been asking my cousin if she could join and she could give me a referral. She was always too lazy because the signing up process is kinda hectic and I just dropped it because it was one dollar,

She told me however that she would join but that she didn’t see the need, that she could just cashapp me a dollar. I told her it’s not the same. I just didn’t push on it for a while.

For added context she’s been on these sites before so she knows about the sign up process.

So today, me on 29 dollars, not interested in any additional surveys, had the bright idea of using any second email and her phone number to register. I realized that I could just do it for her and I didn’t want to bother her to check her email. Then after the process came time for phone validation. I put her phone number there and went to her room to ask if she had gotten a code. 

She was working at the moment, and it involved her transcribing voice notes from the hospital she works at into a word document. I asked her if she could check her messages real quick and she told me she was busy. I told her it would only take a second and then she snapped really aggressively at me, so I backed off.

About an hour later, I see her coming over to me, thinking she was going to give me the code, instead she asks
“How did these people get my number?”

I was pissed because I know that she knows these sites require number verification. She also knows that her number wouldn’t be leaked to thirsty guys online or anything. I felt she was trying to shift the narrative and instead of apologizing for being aggressive over something so trivial, she wanted to flip it around on me and make me seem like the bad guy.

I told her she should no longer worry about t and I didn’t need her number anymore. She got angry and she hasn’t been speaking to me since. AITA?",YTA.

830,"AITA For siding with my step-dad rather than my mom? I know the title is a bit vague but I wanted to keep the meaty stuff for here, title would be a bit too long anyway.

Anyway, my story starts with when I overhear arguing between my mom and my step-dad downstairs, I had my headphones on so I really couldn't understand what was going on; I just ignored it thinking they were talking loud. After it all stops I go downstairs to see what the aftermath was, to my surprise, quite big, my step-dad had left the house and my mom was just cleaning up, I didn't want to ask what it was about because I didn't really want to set her off again; so I go back upstairs and ask my sister. She says that she heard them arguing over the fact that my step-dad asked what was for dinner, and my mom said nothing because he didn't ask (this is weird because she usually cooks something by dinner time obviously, I was of course confused as well, I had totally forgot that we hadn't eaten yet.) My sister then says that my step-dad stormed out because he was hungry and expected food to be done by the time he got home from work, I honestly thought the same. 

After 10 minutes my step-dad hasn't come back so I go downstairs again and ask my mom where he is, she says she doesn't know, I then ask why he has gone out, she explains to me why (what I explained previously), she defends herself saying that we should have asked, I argue that we have been waiting a while and we expected food to be done by now and that she should have made something, because it's what she usually does, she proceeds to kick off so I just head upstairs. 5 or so minutes later I'm still starving, and I assume my sister is too, so I grab my car keys and I take us to McDonalds. On the way out however she asks where we're going and why, I say that we're going go McDonalds because we're hungry and that she should have made something, she just scoffs and says whatever. Me slightly pissed off just goes ""Well at least [SD] had the right idea"" and Storm out with my sister.

833,"AITA for not allowing my children to use their phones to contact my ex? AITA? Backstory: My ex is a real treat.  He gave my older kids eating disorders, tried to brainwash the kids into urine therapy through scaring them that cavities were cancer and we had an epic divorce full of him demanding dirt, which I wasn't about to pay to excavate from the yard.  After the divorce he quit his job (making over 100k with benefits) to be a full time bitcoin trader.  Bitcoin dropped and he hasn't been keeping up to date on payments to me and I am still covering the kids extra expenses completely even when he says he will help.

I got my older son a cell phone a few years ago and the ex would pay half of the bill, but my son lost the phone so it was turned off.  In June I got my older two phones and my ex refused to pay for any of the bills.  For Christmas this year I gave my younger son a new cell phone case that was military tested for drops and everything (I got the same case for myself) and he broke it while at my ex's house.  I told my son that he couldn't take his phone anywhere outside of our house without a case due to him being 11 and not the best at not dropping things.

My ex called me very upset that he couldn't contact the 11 year old on his phone, I explained that he doesn't have his phone because he doesn't have a case.  My ex then went into a tirade that whoever bought such a shitty case was an idiot and the case was obviously shitty and how the purchaser should have done better research on cases and purchase better products.  I calmly said would you like to purchase a better case for our child's phone? Quickly he quipped that the children's phones were none of his concern and hung up on me. For the record my case is doing great and despite my kids dropping my phone, has not broken or been damaged.

After that phone call I told my children they are not to use their cell phones to contact (text or call) their father because their cell phones are not his concern, and he refuses to help with the costs. If they need to contact their father they can use my phone or ask me to contact him.

My older son says I am putting him in the middle of our conflict because my ex won't take my phone calls and will take the kids calls. Which is true, my kids watch him not answer my calls when they are with him.  I said I am actually taking the kids out of the middle of the conflict and putting me right in the middle to handle all contact.   My kids think I am unreasonable.   Am I the asshole?

&#x200B;

Edit: We all use my phone to contact him most of the time.  My daughters exclusively use my phone to contact their father.  I guess I was petty.  I was reacting to him.  The good news is it was only Monday that all this went down and I can take a minute and let it go then the kids can contact him again. However, I am not in a rush to buy a new case for the 11 year old's phone.  

Thanks guys for helping me see past my emotions.  ","YTA. 

The fact that your ex isn't financially helping with your kids' phones has virtually nothing to do with this - does he pay for your phone? If he doesn't, why would you let your kids use your phone to contact him? 

This is some horribly petty impulse you should absolutely be curbing. Your kids are probably already suffering due to you two being separated, and there is no reason to involve them in these games.

836,"AITA for letting my dog crap in a soccer field? AITA- This evening I took my pup across the street to the soccer field to let him run off some energy. We do this fairly often because it’s convenient and our dog is at home for most of the day. I make sure he stays away from the playground and such, and am mindful of kids and people etc. My dog listens fairly well, and generally the playground/soccer field families display neutral attitudes towards the dog, and occasionally kids get psyched and wanna play with him. 

Tonight I took the dog out back first because he always shits after dinner. He didn’t wanna go in the yard, so I assumed he would across the street at the field. We’re minding our own business as the sun is setting and we’re feeling the nice fall breeze through our hair, and Hans (pup) picks a spot to drop a ripe deuce. I anticipated this, and thus had a bag with me and casually worked my way over to pick up like a civilized person. Before I have the chance to bend down, this older man resembling Bill Murray in Caddyshack shouts at me, and then begins approaching me.  He proclaims that dogs aren’t allowed in the park per the sign, and I calmly clarified that I’m taking care of my “shit” and that the sign actually says “Please pick up after your pets.” 

This did not go over well and “Bill” then accused me of being a disgusting person (along with some additional strong language) because children play in the soccer field and that I’m making them roll in dog crap. I responded about how that was unreasonable seeing that I was picking up my dog crap and pointed out that the only children present were kids who were about a football field away in the other direction (at the playground where children play). 

He then proceeded to walk directly toward me and and dialed 911. Here’s his conversation: “I don’t know who to contact, but there’s a lady here and her dog crapped in the park. Yes, she has a bag. Yes, she’s picking it up right now..” I called him an “assjacket” and  said that he should be ashamed of displaying such immature behavior in front of his kids, and then GTFO. 

I walked with purpose down the block, turned up a neighbor’s driveway, and sneaked my way back home by crawling through my neighbor’s backyard because this guy was patrolling the park like Mussolini.

839,"AITA for threatening my flatmate that I will tell the guy who has a crush on her that she is manipulating him? Info: both of them are my flatmates. John has a huge crush on Anna. He always denies it but it is pretty obvious that he does. It started with some innocent flirting but now it got to an extreme point where he only talks about her/with her and does not care about anyone or anything else. 






John always puts her on a pedestal, by making her opinion superior to ours, the other flatmates. For instance, we were supposed to go to a house viewing for next year; she was the only busy one(out of 5), and I recommended to go without her and take videos/pictures for her, because the houses are getting sold fast and this one was the one that we all agreed on for a while. He went on a rant on how she needs to see the house because it will be hers as well and she never got to chose her house before(as if the other of us ever did). We ended up rescheduling. Fortunately we did not lose the house but we were close to because a day after us someone else tried to make an offer. There are other examples too but the main issue is not this one.





I blamed John for being so stupid. He always makes an effort to let her get her way, while she only enjoys the attention and never reciprocates these gestures or even feelings. She even said multiple times that she does not like him romantically. I blamed him for so long until I talked to someone about it and it suddently clicked... She lets him do it. She never told him to stop making her opinion superior to ours, she never talked to him about the possibility of him having feelings for her which are not reciprocated, she always manipulates him on being on her side with everything. When she does not want to go out she just flutters her eyelashes at him and gets her way, even though he wanted to go out in the first place. And it's not even like they go and have sex, she just goes to sleep but does not want him to go out without her.






I realised how bad it got when I got back to University after Christmas and he won't talk to me about anything if it is not about her. He is so absorbed and even inside jokes we used to have now need to be explained to her as well, as if we are not allowed to have our own things anymore without including her. I used to be close friends with him last semester and now I am losing him because she manipulates him.







I confronted her about all this and she told me that he does not like her in that way and that they are just close friends. She told me there is nothing him and her need to talk about. She also told me how me being the third wheel is all in my head(although all my flatmates feel the same way) and that I am a bitch for implying that she is using him for attention. I told her that I will talk to him about this as well and she was fuming. She told me that she would hate me for doing this and if I care about her, I shouldn't.

Sorry to sound like the grinch here folks.


My girlfriend and I have been dating for about 8 months and I absolutely adore her, she’s great it works I’m glad about time right? Lol but the only downfall is she has a bulldog that’s about 120 pounds overweight, he slobbers everywhere, makes me sneeze like crazy, invades my personal space, wakes me up randomly barking in the middle of the night (I’m an army vet so that means I wake up in attack mode myself with a shotty in hand and scan her house, we both live alone btw) and is just overall to me a nuisance.


Recently she’s been wanting to live together because she lives far from her job and and I live really close (my job is also close everything works right!?). The only problem is I told her I don’t want the dog in my house and she was devastated. She’s never really had a relationship over 2 years and this dog has been in her life for about 5 and it’s her longest relationship although she regularly hangs out with friends who’s she’s know for since high school so I don’t understand the bond there to the animal. The thing is 120 lbs although not an aggressive breed my landlord said he doesn’t want it here point blank no exceptions .


Ok no problem so I start looking for houses and apartments etc and filter large dogs and I’m shocked .... the difference in prices, interest rates, and overall selection is outstanding. Like fucking night and day. Plus she always complains the dog is costing her so much in food and medication(she’s a bartender in off season doesn’t make much and I’m a senior software engineer in the six figure mark so I one day expect that dog to become part of my expenses because she can’t really afford him).
So looking at all these housing options I’m taking a huge risk and losing a lot of money over an animal that isn’t mine. I think I love this girl but I feel like this is a huge deal breaker for me.

851,"WIBTA for not wanting to dance with an overweight girl? I'm in my junior year of high school and I'm in something called show choir, which is like chorus but with dancing. I'm also in theater and my plan for as long as I can remember is to be an actor and be on Broadway one day.

This year a really big overweight girl joined show choir and theater because she's a really good singer and we don't have a regular chorus for her to be in. It hasn't been too bad, she isn't the best dancer but she can keep up with the steps. In our last show, the director asked me to be her dance partner and to be nice to her because some of the other members make fun of her. I did and the show went fine.

The problem is that we just got the casting last month for our end of the year show, and I got the principle male solo and she got the girls one, which means we're partners again. The show is lots of 'swing' music and dancing and because she can't do that kind of dancing where she gets lifted up, the choreography for our parts is a lot easier.

I'm starting to put together a 'reel' of my work for applying to my dream programs for college and I don't want my big principle solo to be me doing easy dances with her. We videotaped rehearsals to watch back and I have to admit that we looked kind of dumb with everyone else swinging around and us doing an easier dance, and since she's so fat it's obvious why so it's just awkward.

I talked to the director about it and he said he was disappointed and basically told me my choices are to give up my role and be a background dancer or dance with her, and that he isn't going to recast her because she's the best female vocalist we have and she can do our simple dance routine pretty good. He said he thought that I'd be more sensitive to someone else's feelings and that I'd value having the most talented person performing instead of the best looking.

I talked to my parents and my dad agrees with the director but my mom is really mad and said she'd talk to the principal for me, because I shouldn't have to hurt my chances of getting into college because this girl has a weight problem. Would I be the asshole if I told my mom to talk to the administration?","YTA. This was a tough one to be honest, but this is high school. I know getting in to college programs may feel like the biggest thing for you, but it is for her too.

Being overweight in Highschool is tough. maybe when she is older, things may be different, but when you are growing, weight is often times going to be wonky. You are asking HER to sacrifice, when you refuse to do the same.

Furthermore, how do you think the director would look if he all of the sudden recast the best singer because she has a weight issue. not only is that cruel, but that could get him in big trouble. 

He also gave you the option to be a background dancer, which according to you is a more complex dance routine anyways, which would fix your official complaint, although I would be willing to bet your real issue is you probably don't want to be seen with her, because you have been offered a solution to your ""problem"" already.

855,"AITA for wanting my former roommates to give me my half of the deposit?  

Okay so I originally moved into a house with my friend, ""Nick."" We paid a deposit to begin renting the house, split fifty-fifty. Then my girlfriend moved in. Then a friend of ours, ""Sean"" moved in. Since me and my girlfriend wanted a place of our own, Sean would move in taking our old room, and Sean and Nick would pay all of the rent for a couple of months to give us help in moving out.

So my girlfriend and I move to a new apartment. We agree that since Nick and I originally paid the deposit, and Sean was essentially ""replacing"" me, it would be fair if Sean paid me half the deposit. Now Sean was a bit behind on money, so I didn't press for my half of the deposit. He agreed to pay me in installments.

I did leave a lot of stuff behind, because I knew the people staying behind and I didn't have to rush.

He sent me the first two installments on time.

Nick later let me know that since my stuff was still there, Sean decided that I wasn't going to be getting the rest of the deposit until my stuff was out. A couple of months had passed since I moved out.

Now I have only a part time job, to cover my bills, because I am also an artist/musician. I also collect vintage toys. I don't have a car anymore for financial reasons (I've bought a few used cars over the years but they've kept breaking down), so it's a bit difficult for me to come get my stuff.

So I told them that it's on them to tell me when they're available to transport me to move my stuff. Nick did bring me over once to move and organize some stuff, but I wasn't able to get most of it. I was mostly focusing on some essentials for the apartment. I wasn't sure where the rest of the collectibles could be put in the new apartment. Then they didn't reach out to me for a couple of weeks about this.

So later I owed my girlfriend some money, and I realized we needed the money ASAP. So I reached out and Sean insisted I wasn't going to get the deposit until the stuff was out of their house.

I said that me and my girlfriend were out of money and that it wasn't fair for the money (still $300) he owed me to be used as leverage to get my stuff out of the house.

I need this money very badly, and they haven't been reaching out to me to tell me when they're available to come get me so I can get the stuff. It's not fair for these conditions to be attached to money they owe me. The stuff isn't really even in their way, there's still a little bit of it upstairs because I don't want it to get damaged, but most of it is still downstairs in the basement corners.

I want to get this stuff out of there as much as they do, but they're making this difficult.

So, AITA?","Let me get this straight....you moved out, don’t pay rent anymore, have been storing your belongings there after being asked multiple times to move them, you moved somewhere where it’s hard to store your collectibles, made no plan for storing your collectibles long term, and expect your former roommates to not only schedule a time for you to remove your stuff, but will come pick you up and provide transportation with their own vehicles.

I have wanted to get a dog for years, ever since I had to put down my childhood dog. I think it will help with my anxiety and depression issues as well as just be a great addition to my life. With our current apartment we have a fenced in yard and what I think is enough space to add a medium sized dog. I take care of all the animals, since they are mine, and would do the same with the new dog.

We're planning to stay in this apartment for a while, so I don't know why the space would be an issue now and not later.

857,"WIBTA for publicly shaming a film processing company for ruining my film I have a filmmaking YouTube channel. Currently, I'm working on some educational videos about shooting on motion picture film. I bought a 16mm and a Super 8 and used them to shoot a little scene. Then, I would compare how 16mm, Super 8, and digital look compared to each other. I'd also offer downloads of the raw digitally scanned footage so subscribers could play with it.

Last week, I sent the film to get processes and scanned. The other day, the company called me and told me they ruined the Super 8mm film in processing. I explained that both the 16mm and the Super 8 are tied together. So far, they will replace the film stock, processing, and scanning for both the 16mm and the Super 8. They'll also send me the digital scan of the original 16mm as well as the damaged Super 8, which I'd like to have, but they aren't really that valuable at this point.

Now, I have to reshoot a scene with all the cameras, and it's going to be a pain. I won't have the same actress or location as before, so there's no way to recreate the original. I also need to get lights and additional tripods again. I asked the company if they could do more for me than what they've offered so far, which effectively, is getting me back to square one on this project. They won't budge.

I didn't want to mention it to them, but I am also making a video on how to shoot on film from start to finish. If they made me happy with making up for their mistake, I wasn't going to mention this company ruined my film. But now I want to include that they did and name the company. I have a little bit of a following on youtube and twitter. Nothing huge, but okay for a niche, filmmaking channel. I don't plan to do a ""do you know who I am?"" to try and get more out of them. But I want to spread the word now that they ruined my film and just replaced the original order.

Would I be the asshole for calling them out? Am I the asshole for expecting more than what they are currently offering?","YTA. Working with film is a delicate process. There are risks involved that are pretty universally known. The company offered a refund, replaced the materials, and is giving you the digital files of what they were able to process. That’s fair. They owned up to their mistake and have attempted to make it right.

858,"AITA for not wanting my young son to visit Colombia? WIBTA for not letting him go? My son’s father (“John”) is Colombian but lives in the US (as do I). Every few years he goes to Colombia to visit his own father and extended family. Our son is under 10, and the last few times John has gone he’s agreed to leave him behind. But this year he is taking him along. Months ago when he bought the tickets, I agreed to this- but the more I think about it the more fearful I get. 

I don’t like the idea of him being out of the country, let alone to one anyone should be cautious visiting. Secondly, none of our last names match so I fear that could complicate international travel. Also, our son does not speak Spanish, so I fear he will feel alienated and not enjoy himself at all. They’re going for two weeks and I dread it. 

To make matters more complicated, John’s father is getting re-married while they’re there. Our son is in the wedding in some capacity, so of course John wants him present. Frankly I feel like this is a stretch because John’s dad has never met our son before.

This year he is getting married and I was adamant on planning the best bachelor party for him. We are not into the debauchery scene so the bachelor party requires traveling to another country. 

During my friend’s gender reveal party the other people going to the trip asked me if I bought my plane tickets and I told them no because I was waiting for the right time.

863,"AITA for referencing Chomsky at dinner with family? Hey guys, first time posting here. 

So I am a college student at home with family over christmas. For starters, I want to say that I don't really think I am smarter than my family members (or most people in general) in terms of raw intelligence. However, I do have a different set of interests than all of them and it has caused some tension that boiled over while the whole family was together. 

The day after Christmas we were all sitting down at dinner. My sister complimented me on my sweater. I thanked her and joked that I thought it looked like something Noam Chomsky would wear. My mother then asked who that was, and I said that he was the guy who wrote Manufacturing Consent, which I would say is a pretty famous book. It was clear that they were all unclear, so I further elaborated, just saying that he was a ""famous professor from MIT"".  I thought it was odd that they didn't know who he was, but we all have blind spots, no big deal. I didn't scoff or go on some tangent about his work. Just said his name and moved on as it was clear they didn't know. 

A day later we hosted a big holiday party and my sister, who was embarrassingly drunk, (backwards shirt, three spilled drinks in the kitchen, etc.) yells in front of me in front of my friends, repeatedly calling me a pussy, saying that she has disliked me for years. After that, she runs upstairs and complains to my other sister and my father, who proceed to tell me that my pretension ""is ripping the family apart"", pointing to the Chomsky reference as a prime example. The next day my older sister (the drunk one) apologized, but the rest of my family didn't, essentially revealing that they still think I am the problem. Neither of my parents or sister said anything about her embarrassing me in front of my friends. Am I the asshole for referencing a pretty famous thinker at dinner? Or am I just a pompous ass?

865,"AITA if I ""cancel"" Christmas because I can't afford it this year? Title says it all, sole provider for family, all cr

THIS HAS SPUN OUT OF CONTROL!  I never thought my sad man pity party would get this kind of response.  I was expecting to be called an asshole, validate my self loathing, and claw my way out of debt by working harder.  I did not expect the absolute torrent of love and support that I in no way deserve or can accept.

INFO (And I am so sorry for not making this crystal clear in the original post): Our mortgage and utilities are paid.  There is food in our fridge and my next paycheck(s) is secure, even though it, too, will all go to bills with none left over for gifts.  I pretended not to notice that we weren't keeping up our pre-child lifestyle without credit cards and I got in over my head and now have to dig myself out of a relatively deep hole meaning I won't have money for gifts and meals out and holiday gatherings and whatnot for a good bit of time to come.  But, I have a great job and an outstanding family support system who all live close by and know what debt feels like and will understand if we can't chip in this year with anything but our presence, but it just felt shameful to have the advantages I have and still manage to fuck it up as bad as I did without asking for help. 

As for all the people begging me to accept help, here is why I can't:  I make a good salary.  There is no chance of me or my family going hungry.  We have food and will have money for food budgeted into my paychecks, which are secure as my job is secure. I have an extremely well funded 401k from 18 years of office work and life insurance to safeguard my family.  Thank you all who were offering food.  Thank you all who offered to buy my 2 year old's amazon wish list.  She's 2 and does not have one.  My wife and I had already decided that she has too many toys and so we had only things like books and a learning tablet in mind for her.  She'll be ok if we can't buy her ""stuff"".  She already has ""stuff"".  Her close in age cousins live on our street and we exchange toys and clothes all the time and both our houses are cluttered with ""stuff"".  This was not about garnering pity or soliciting charity.  It was my insecurity equating gifts with love that warped Christmas for me.  It almost ruined Christmas for me.  Regardless of the vote here, I truly am THE asshole for that.  So please, turn your charity to your communities, your neighbors.  Not some middle class jagoff who spent himself into debt trying to prove how much he loved a family that only needed him to be a happy and healthy presence at home.  You all have humbled me beyond words, beyond charity.  You have given me both the perspective and the courage to seek professional help, both financial and psychological, and hopefully it's not too late for this stupid old man to become a better father and husband.  Yes Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.  His spirit is truly embodied in all of you beautiful and selfless redditors.  Never lose the light.  Love and cheer to all.  But as you can see, I deserve neither your charity nor your goodness, and I'm going to go disappear back into anonymity now if possible and work on me.

Update for those concerned:  I have not ever, even for a second, considered hurting myself.  Not once.  I'm showing my age here, but Goonies never say die.

Update for INFO, and I hope this answers all the questions people had, as there were many, and so I'm just going to write a bio that answers them all:  I live in the Mid-Atlantic United States.  When we got pregnant (after 6 years of trying and failing and treatments and tears) we found out that it would cost us $50 a month for my wife to work her current job and put our daughter in full time daycare, as day care costs upwards of $1600 a month for even local co-ops, to say nothing of the $2100+ that most daycare companies were asking.  The solution was for her to ""retire"" and take up the even harder job of full time mother.  I work 8-5 at a day job and I pick up shifts DJing at a local bar at night and DJ private events/weddings/etc... when I can book them.  My daughter was about to turn 2, and be able to start 3 day a week ""preschool"" for far less than the cost of 5 day a week daycare, meaning my wife could work again, at least part time.  I was in the referral process to find a surgeon to do my vasectomy when we found out that despite using birth control, my wife was pregnant again. We're due in February, a little boy this time.  Utter shock, disbelief, some truly unhealthy thoughts, and finally acceptance that I was going to have to continue to be the full time provider, as there was no way we could put 2 kids in full time care, so once again, my sainted wife will have to spend at least another 2 years as a full time mom.  My wife and I are old people(42M, 40F) who tried to have kids earlier in life, but couldn't despite multiple treatments, and only succeeded when we stopped trying so hard and resigned ourselves to the thoughts of a comfortable dual income no kids lifestyle full of travel and memories, Bringing one life into this world at 40 after everything we went through was a laugh, only for life to turn around and ""bless"" me with a second child.  My wife is overjoyed, and I am happy but terrified of how I will afford this.  She applied for part time seasonal work to help with our bills, but the job she was hired for has given her exactly 2 shifts in 2 weeks, and taken one of those shifts away at the last minute due to overstaffing.  She has a meeting with them today to find out if it's worth her time to stay employed there, dependent on if they can actually give her at the least 20 hours a week which she requested upon applying.  We have had joint finances since we were engaged.  We don't hide things from each other, we're both well aware of our money issues and have been working on ways to improve our financial situation. (Thank you all for the links and sites, I am bookmarking them all!).  We have and will keep communication open.  It was our promise made to each other 13 years ago to never shoulder our burdens alone.

Lastly (hopefully, I know this is long) I am humbled by your offers of charity, dear strangers.  Truly and deeply humbled.  I cannot accept them, be it out of foolish pride or some other moral driver, but know that your kind words and even kinder offers have softened my resolve to cancel Christmas this year.  I just spent 2 days with co-workers volunteering at 2 local food banks preparing meals, clothes, and groceries for the community, so if you're one of the many wonderful strangers who offered help, please give that help to your local charity.  I have a roof over my head, and food in my belly, and I could not ask for more, not when I have so much already.  

I still dread the thought of lugging that old fake tree out of the laundry room, but my feelings have to come 3rd, here and always.  My wife and daughter need the love and joy that that old tree will bring, and I need to give them everything I can, even if it's the just the spirit of the season. They deserve to feel the warmth of a festive home, and we already own the damn thing, so it's literally the least I can do.  My presents will be the 1 million pictures my wife will take of our daughter pulling all the ornaments she can reach off the tree and showing them to her with that beautiful smile she has.  Our families are close by, and our parents will no doubt do their best to spoil our daughter and I know it will be more than enough.




To those of you who have asked how could I have tried for 6 years to have a kid and ""not bothered to budget for it once it came"" are greatly underestimating how much fertility treatments cost even with insurance, and how well and truly fucked American Healthcare really is.

869,"AITA for not meeting parents expectations? So here's a little background story that I'll try to keep short and objective (and probably fail miserably) for context:

My parents got divorced when I was around 4 or 5 (I obviously can't remember and no one ever really talked about so I still don't know much about it) and since then I've been moving back and forth between where both of them lived. They lived in the same city for 3 years and then my mom moved like 1000km away and took me with her. I had been with her for 3 years when my dad fought in court to have my custody (details also not revealed fully to me but my conditions living with mom weren't the best, at one point we were living behind her boyfriend's bar). 3 more years with dad, 1 with mom, 2 with dad then the rest (kind of) with mom. 

Needless to say that the moving back and forth kept me from making significant friends and my childhood friendship isn't what it could have been. Also each parent had it's fundamental flaw (imo) mom was emotionally manipulative and probably had some mental health issues, she didn't really do much all day didn't really expect anything from me but I guess was more loving than my dad, which worked all day (7am to sometimes 6pm up to 22pm), when I was younger it wasn't really that bad, but when I got older he would barely talk to me, I'd be grounded all the time because of bad grades and messy room, when he got remarried most days he would only see me at lunch and they wouldn't invite me to dinner. 

When I was 18 I got into uni because I had to. Hated every second of it but thought I'd finish it to keep my dad off my back. Turns out I couldn't do it, dropped out last year and was in a bad place mentally (I'm not diagnosed with anything, I've been to 3 psychologists when I was younger but none of them for very long, more recently I've been to 2 psychiatrists which haven't really said much but gave me prescriptions, so I don't know). 

Now my dad knows and is pressuring me about how I don't do anything and I need a job and I need to solve my problems and I need to study because otherwise I won't get a job. I know all of that and it's been really hard, I've been trying to get a job for over six months and I've just now enrolled in a gastronomy course which will give me a diploma, but my dad is having none of that.

What I feel like is they never gave me any emotional support or love, it was always about getting good grades and meeting their expectations. I never felt good enough and I personally think it stopped me from doing a lot of things, also because they would disagree with it.

I've told my dad he doesn't need to support me anymore and I've been taking a break from my mom because she's so negative. I don't know how I could have been a better daughter, but if I knew I would have been.

870,"AITA in this work place dispute Long one because I wanted to detail as much as possible, sorry in advance. 

Little bit of background: I work as a store manager in a retail store. I have been a store manager for various  companies for over 12 years now and have to had issues at any of my places of work. I usually become friends with everyone and enjoy working  I love working, I love making people feel like coming to work, enjoying it and looking forward to it.

I found out in late December that my assistant store manager was getting promoted to store manager of his own store. I was beyond excited and happy for him, he works his butt of and deserves it. This caused one issue though: during the winters my company usually only runs with a store manager and assistant store manager, we hire people around February/March and let them go around October. Very seasonal. So because of this promotion, I was going to be working by myself. 

I was told that one slower store was going to be sending me help twice a week. Instead of having double coverage that day, the SM would do open to close, which isn't hard because they get 2-3 people a day during an 8-9 hour shift. Plus, their ASM lives right by my store so it's a better drive for them anyways. 5 inutes compared  to 45. I call them and discuss it, they're not sure what days and are a newer store manager so I talked it through with them ""you're taking Sunday and Mondays off, we have ASM trainings on Tuesdays and this person needs Thursdays off, so why don't we do this: Tuesday they go to training, Wednesday and Thursday off, work my store Friday and Saturday, work your store Sunday and Monday so you can have your days off."" 

They said they would talk to the asm and then get back to me. Called me later that day ""yeah she refuses to work there Friday and Saturday because she wants to be at her home store, so we are going to do Tuesdays and Wednesdays. I point out the ASM trainings would get in the way, she says they won't. 

That week, Tuesday the asm can't make it because of training. Then they call Monday and let me know that they have a doctor's appointment on Wednesday and can only work a half day, then calls back to say they can't work it at all. I scramble and am able to get another store to help out, but have to buy them lunch. 

The next week they announce to me they can't help because the store manager has to do inventory on Tuesday and Wednesday. I point out again, maybe we should switch the days because it doesn't seem to be working. ""nope, this is an anomaly, it'll work out"" 

It happens yet again this week. Asm training so can't do Tuesday, something came up on Wednesday. I express my frustrations as calmly as possible and say that if we just went with my schedule we would be fine. ""I'm not trying to tell you how to manager bu-"" ""well it sure seems like you are. You're really ungrateful and I can't make everyone happy"" 

At this point, I point out 
""hey, I'm not ungrateful, it's just really hard to deal with this when I'm getting told last minute that I'm not getting coverage and it's been happening every single week""
 ""oh so I haven't helped you?"" 
"".....no. You haven't. You haven't covered a single day off when you were supposed to""
""Well I can't please everyone.""
""I understand that and I'm not saying you should, I'm saying that if you aren't going to be able to help me, give me some notice and maybe contact our boss so I can get some help""

I end the call because I realize I've started to raise my voice. I tell them ""Im not mad at you or upset with you, I'm frustrated with the situation and how there seems to be a very easy solution but we aren't going for it. I'm going to let you go, let me know when you can help me."" 

After this, the manager calls back a bunch of times and keeps apologizing, I keep saying ""I'm not mad or upset with you, I just want a solution to the answer and you were supposed to help. If you can't, I understand, just let our boss know so I can get help""

After the first week of issues I even had asked my boss if I could work 6 days a week, just to make it easier on us. He said ""as long as you're okay with it"" and I replied with ""hey I would work 7 if you would let me"" ""well you can't do that but I appreciate you trying to make it as easy as possible"" 

This is now the next week, I haven't heard anything about when I'm getting coverage except that this manager called our boss and said they couldn't help. I called my boss this morning and said ""hey, just calling to see if we had heard about what day I'm getting coverage yet""

I was met with ""hey I wanted to talk to you about that. Manager called and was pretty upset over your conversation. You were pretty aggressive and non sensitive to the fact that they are emotional and hate when they can't help. You need to get better at that and mature as a store manager because that is unacceptable. They've been in bad situations where they wanted to help but couldn't. ""

I tried to tell my side of it and got interrupted with ""hey, I'm not mad at you, you just handled this wrong and going forward you need to see that.""

I was quiet for the rest of the call because it felt like anything I would say would just come off bad. At the end he said ""I need you to talk with Manager and figure out what days you're getting help. Obviously Tuesday doesn't work so let's change that day""

I mention that it's that very subject that started this and they're insisting on doing it that day. ""Well then you need you to call every other manager and get their schedules and see what day they can help. If not figure out why and what their people are doing on their off days, call all 18 stores and get back to me."" 

Am I the asshole here? I gave up my ASM willingly, suggested going down to 1 day off at my own expense, to help the other store manager out. When I felt that I was raising my voice, I stopped, let the person know I wasn't mad or upset with them and got off the phone.

So i have a roommate who has been in a long distance relationship with they’re bf for years now and i’ve met him before. He’s nice and they seem happy together, but that’s not the problem.

My roommate who we will call Rose is a close friend of mine and we also work together. Our coworker Hotdog just started working as a manager at our work about 6 months ago. When we got back to work Rose changed a lot in personality and had started flirting with Hotdog. It started out as playful banter and just harmless flirting but recently it’s gotten to a point where my other roommate Jewel (who also works with us) has been noticing as well as a lot of our other coworkers. Rose has begun to flirt more and more and has been spending time out with Hotdog and Jewel has said that Hotdog seems to be getting a little uncomfortable with it now. We all think it’s going too far and will keep going too far.

872,"AITA for intentionally spilling soda on this lady? Yesterday, I got on a plane for a 6 hour flight across the US. Traveling is usually not too bad for me, because I'm like 5'0, 90lbs, despite being a 15 year old boy, so leg room is never an issue.

My flight was under booked, so there was only gonna be one other person in my row of three. I settle into the window seat (which was on my ticket) and wait. Finally, a woman shows up, she's about 25 and very tall, like maybe 5'11 or 6'0. She sits down in the aisle seat leaving a gap between us cause why not.

She makes friendly conversation with me, talking about her work and stuff, and I politely smile and listen, I don't mind any of that. Then she asks, because she's so tall, if she can have the window seat so she can stretch her legs without blocking the aisle. I happily say yes and switch with her and there's no problem. 

A bit into the flight, she starts putting her stuff on the middle seat; her bag, her laptop - just for extra storage. I truly don't mind, I wouldn't have used it anyway. But then, she tells me that she's feeling really cramped, and needs more leg room. My legs barely touch the floor, so I offered to sit criss cross so she could stretch her legs across all three seats. 

Things are fine for a while, I figure this won't be for the whole flight, but I notice her getting comfortable when she takers her shoes off. Twenty minutes later she fell asleep, still completely spread out, with her headphones in.

I'm the absolute worst at confrontation, and I couldn't bring myself to say anything to her. When the drink cart came around, I got a ginger ale, but didn't wake her up for anything. I then decided that I had enough of her sitting like this, so I ""accidentally"" spilled some soda onto her legs. She woke up, and I apologized saying it was an accident. She smiled and said it was all okay and moved her legs. I had my leg room for the rest of the flight.

I honestly feel really bad about doing it, part of me feels like she was being respectful the whole time and that I was the one out of place, but part of me also feels like she shouldn't have done that. Was I an asshole?

873,"AITA for telling my wife i would prefer it if she breastfed our son for atleast at the start. Me,  33 and My wife Ella, 25 is 30 weeks pregnant, we have been trying for  2 years due to her having cystic ovaries. 

We have briefly touched on the topic of breastfeeding a few times and as far as i knew or assumed this is what jess wanted to do, we both attended birthing classes and pre birth parent classes where they strongly advocated breastfeeding.

There were many benefits explained to us such as it being akin to a babies first immunization, it contains much richer nutrients than formulabmilk, its free and always the right temp, no bottles to wash and no night time making milk rituals. 

It seriously sounded like the best option,  then the other day we were packing the emergancy hospital to go bag they recommended and i mentioned that we needed to buy a breast pump as that was strongly reccomended by the midwife. 

This is when Jess suddenly changed her mind about breastfeeding,  she said she doesn't think it is for her, I asked why and she said because of her social anxiety she will be terrified to breastfeed in public and that because her right nipple is slightly inverted it just seemed like something she wasn't comfortable with. 

She then went on to tell me she's been researching different formula and bottles and thay she felt much more relaxed doing it that way.

My issues are these,  the midwives we spoke to were extremely passionate about the breastfeeding route and made it clear that breastfed babies have less chance of sids and less colic, they also said it helps with bonding.

Jess was obviously present for all of these appointments,  knowing all of that but choosing to use formula is just baffling to me,  to turn away all of those benefits for our son because she is anxious about people seeing her breastfeed, I can't get my head round it,  they sell covers for breastfeeding and they have parent rooms.

The midwife also said not to worry about the inverted nipple as they have something for that.

I know it's her choice at the end of the day but i don't feel as though shes given a very good reason to use formula when he could benefit so much from breast milk. 

Money isn't an issue we can afford the formula amd everything I just don't feel like this is the right choice,  I brought this up as tactfully as i could to Jess but she immediately told me I wouldn't understand.

She said it just isn't for her and that she can't really explain it,  I said that wasn't really a good reason vs all of the benefits she asked me not to bring it up again but i think its a huge thing to just ignore   
Im doing my best to bs as informed as possible amd just want what's right for the baby ans that's why i just cabt get this issue out of my mind, he could be getting much healthier nutrient rich milk that's always ready AITA","YTA.

875,"AITA for refusing to marry my boyfriend until my sister is happier? My sister is 5 years older than me, single, and lives at home. She sounds like a loser, but she’s actually incredibly smart and kind and just going through a rough time. She majored in a STEM field that turned out to to be poorly paying. She’s working on a second degree while working part-time at her old job. Her most recent boyfriend, who we all thought she would marry, left her for someone he met at work. Her boyfriend before that, who we also thought she would marry, broke up with her because his parents wanted him to marry someone from the same cultural background. 

As a teenager I was severely depressed and failing out. When my sister realized how bad I was, she got really involved in my life. I shut everyone out but she forced herself in and pushed me to make decisions that I didn’t necessarily believe in at the time but that helped me avoid the mistakes she made. Now at 23, I’ve followed my sister’s advice on everything from clubs to major to career. She even wrote my resume every year. 

My sister didn’t pick my boyfriend but gave me lots of advice on what to look for. I turned down several guys based in part because of her and I think it saved me a lot of grief. I eventually met a guy who is incredible. He fulfills all of my criteria, makes me happier than I knew I could be, and our friends call us a power couple. Together we make over 300k and are ready to start our lives together. His parents love me and want to buy us a house once we’re married. We’ve literally never argued for more than 10 minutes before this.

I know an engagement or wedding announcement would be really hard on my sister. She has never said anything negative to me, but she’s told our parents that she feels like a failure because she can't help but compare our lives. That broke my heart. Getting married in the near future feels cruel considering everything she did for me when I was depressed. She’s not in the financial state to celebrate with me the way I want either. My boyfriend and I are also young (23 going on 24) and I was already planning to freeze my eggs, so I don’t see a need to rush.

My boyfriend says we need to prioritize our happiness over my sister’s happiness. He says we don’t know when she’ll be better, we don’t know if something will happen to one of our parents, he wants to be on my insurance when he goes to grad school (he could use his parents’ insurance before 26 or private insurance after), he wants to live with me officially (I live at his place unofficially, but because of conservative relatives I officially rent a cheap room near my work) and he wants to spend time married before starting a family (I don't see how a piece of paper changes our relationship).",[deleted],1,YTA,0.0,,1
877,"WIBTAH if I don't let my step kids watch TV when they get home? So I'm 35F, my husband is 35M, he has 2 kids ages 4&6. They don't usually live with us but have been staying here for the last 2 months because their mom has been pretty sick(she's not dying, she's getting better now). 

We only have one TV. We live in a small two bedroom and don't really need another. The only thing the kids do is watch TV, they don't play with toys much and we have a lot here for them to play with. 

Everyday when I get home they are watching TV, so I haven't gotten to watch TV in 2 months. Sometimes when they start playing with toys I would change the cartoons to something I would want to watch. Of course they would start crying and my husband would turn the cartoons back on.
I'm getting pretty sick of this shit, so tonight I'm planning on turning on what I want to watch and no amount of crying is going to change that. They can go in their bedroom and play like children should. 
I know this probably sounds petty to a lot of people, but this is my home too damn it. I'm so tired of hearing the same cartoons over and over! I love these kids, but I'm a firm believer that adults should not walk on eggshells to please kids.

Ugh, WIBTAH?

Editited to add some info.... Now that I've reread this I definitely sound like a B. I guess a part of the problem is that I don't really know the kids. I do like and even love them and I have never been unkind or mean to them. I know they are going through a lot right now with their mom being sick. I met my husband in the States and we lived there for a couple of years before we moved to his home country about 6 months ago where his children live. I never met them before this. I feel like I'm still kind of a stranger to them and shouldn't be the one parenting them yet. It should be my husband's responsibility and I should just be supporting him until the kids know me better. I really don't know how to be a stepparent. Someone here called me the evil stepmom and I definitely would be if I started trying to enforce rules and be strict while their father let's them do whatever they want.

In high school I had a crush on this girl, but I was too nervous to ever actually talk to her, so I would just watch her from across the classroom. Looking back on it, that was incredibly creepy and fucked up, even if I did find her attractive. 

I know she works at a certain restaurant because I recognized her the one time I went in with my mom. I didn’t say anything to her because I was still too nervous. 

It’s been over a year since then. I’ve finished my first year of college, about to start my second, and as cliche as it sounds, I’ve changed a lot as a person. I’ve realized a lot of the mistakes I’ve made in my life, and I’ve gotten much better at talking to people.

For a while now, I’ve been wanting to apologize to her for being so creepy and weird in high school. I don’t know if she cares or even remembers, but it’s important to me. I tried to find her on social media but I wasn’t able to.

A few hours later (about fifteen minutes ago), the GM called me and said that that was wildly inappropriate and that they consider that harassment, and he asked me not to come in again.

I’m not gonna go in again, but I don’t really see how it’s harassment or inappropriate. It would be harassment if I continued, right? And I wasn’t forcing anyone to do anything.

It caused a discussion because my joke had nothing to do with him, or religions.

888,"AITA for getting mad when friends removed me from a pet project? About a year ago, an online friend of mine started developing lore for a fictional kingdom he created. Since then, more of the people from the same group started creating their own kingdoms and stories and the like to add to this word, including myself. I believe I first conceptualized my kingdom in around January, and since then I've gotten extremely little ideas on paper with slightly more still floating in my head. One thing I did put on paper was the existence of another humanoid species and some utilities that I didn't realise were created significantly later than when this is supposed to take place. Since then, some more things have been established and the friends often kind of mocked my lore in a joking manner which I had assumed was tongue in cheek. As I became more active in the group, more and more arguments kept arising between me and the group, and in particular the guy who created the first kingdom and was the de facto leader of the project. Most of the arguments stemmed from either people not recognizing when I was joking or from the leader guy seeming aggressive, leading to me often lashing out. I never really thought much of this until I became more and more aware that almost all of these people had grown to dislike me. Out of the blue, I was told that my creations were being removed from the world they created and something else is going to take its place, which had apparently been discussed a lot without me being aware. I wanted some time to think about it, but before I could respond again, later that day all of my creations had been removed anyways. I was quite bothered by this and complained about how they didn't consult me. Basically everyone else was claiming that they had spoken to me about this multiple times and that I'm lucky that they decided to do that and send me copies of my work, saying this was their world they created and I had frequently shown that I didn't care about it and thought it was dumb. To be fair, I did say this once or twice as a joke, but I assumed it was obvious I wasn't serious. As stated earlier, they're often not good at picking up on my jokes, and eventually I left the chat when it felt like I was being ganged up on. There were a few of the friends I felt comfortable talking to about it, two of them ignored all of my messages and one clarified that the issue was in that they all felt they couldn't talk to me and that they had tried to tell me about this before but I didn't pick up on it. I told all of them multiple times I would be more than happy to revise my lore but none of them responded. AITA?

We agreed to bet $5 each on a boxed trifecta and completed the betting slip at our table. It was my turn to go to the bar to submit it. I took it up and put it in the machine, expecting to need to pay $10. The screen showed that the wager was actually $50, so we must have filled the slip incorrectly. I saw that the race was about to start and I didn’t have time to fill in a new one correctly, so I just agreed to pay the full amount, taking the rest of the wager on myself.

I collected the money and brought it back to the table when he asked for half of it. I told him that because I paid $45/$50 of the bet, that I was entitled to 90% of the winnings. He said that we went into the bet at 50/50, so he should still get half of it. We argued for the rest of the day.

There is a party coming up and I saw she was in the attendees list, with her affair partner (now married). I kept thinking about it and kept getting angry. I realized I would not enjoy myself if she was there.

I reached out to the organizer and asked if I should go out to the party. They know my story, so they immediately knew why I was asking.

YTA, and more than anyone else, YTA to yourself.

Everyone keeps on saying that the person cheated on has no obligation to forgive or move on. No obligation to forgive? Completely fair.

But it being okay not to move on? After two years?

Look, I'm going to be honest here. You need to move on - for your own sake. Clearly, your ex and her husband run in at least some similar circles as you if you'll were invited to the same party. In this situation, you were able to get them uninvited. 

That will not work every time.

Some people will choose to not uninvite already invited guests. Some will think you're being childish. And sometimes, you're going to get blindsided with them at a party.

*You cannot make you enjoyment of a social event conditional on your ex's attendance - or lack thereof - at said event.* It is not a healthy state of mind to be in.

Neither is the fact that you ""kept getting angry"" - like I said, I understand not forgiving either of them. But after two years, I honestly don't think it's healthy to hold on to your anger like that.

It would be one thing if this was a week, or 2 months, or 6 months post the cheating reveal and the breakup. But it's been two years. You holding on to your ex is not good for you - and you are holding on to her, even if it's through your worst memories of her. You can see the effect of doing so on AITA every once-in-a-while, where the crux of the question lies in the fact that one partner cannot get over being cheated on in the past, and become overbearing/paranoid/whatever with their new partner, causing issues in the relationship.

For your own sake, you need to move on. YTA to yourself all the way here - please consider telling the host not to prevent them from coming, seeing a therapist ASAP, and going to and enjoying the party with them present. Ignore them there. Have fun. You know how after a teen break up, a teen girl always tries to post the hottest and most fun pics on her Insta so the guy can see what he lost (no judgements, I was her once)? You need to do that. Live your best life, and don't let your ex have more control over your life than she already had.

Background: I've been with my (F25) Boyfriend (M28)  for 5 years, 4 of those years we have spent living 5 mins down the road from his family and an hour away from mine. Naturally we see his family a lot more than mine. 

My brother is at a university about 4 hours away and in his 2nd year. We travel back to my parents house to see him whenever he is home but as my mum works on Saturdays we always go on a Sunday. 

Issue: my brothers 21st is coming up on Thursday March 26th. We always have a family meal but seeing as it is a big birthday extended members of family will also be coming. I currently dont know if this meal is going to fall on the weekend before or after his actual birthday. My BFs dads birthday falls on Sunday March 22nd. 

Yesterday when I got home my boyfriend announces that there is a family meal for his dads birthday (not a special one) on the Sunday 22nd. I replied saying that's fine but I dont know when my brothers 21st meal will fall so essentially I was giving him a heads up that it's possible we might have clashing plans. My boyfriend out right tells me he will not be missing his dads birthday meal to go to my brothers. His answer to clashing plans was 'we go our separate ways'.

His answer really upset me but I tried to compromise. The logical suggestion was that we take his dad for lunch and spend the morning and afternoon with him and then we would head over to my brothers celebration in the evening. Nope. This would not work for my BF. 

We then got into a very heated argument as I feel that he puts his family first. His response was 'I'm not telling my dad we will not be attending his birthday meal to attend your brothers meal when it's not even his birthday that day'

Granted, it isnt my brothers actual birthday day but it is highly likely this will be the only day we can see him for his 21st as he will be going back to uni in the week and as 13+ people would be coming to the meal I dont have much say over the time or date. 

It's all hypothetical at the moment but his reaction (amongst other things) has shown me that if the meal does fall on the same date he is not willing to compromise. 

I thought I was being reasonable suggesting we see his dad in the morning and afternoon seeing as they live 5 mins away and then we travel to my parents for the 21st birthday meal.

On this day, though, he surprised me with a second deuce that, short of picking it up with my hands, I could only look at regretfully under the tree next to the sidewalk on a side street.

I continued about my walk, making sure to hit my usual Pokestops and failing to catch a particularly squirelly Pidgey who ran away after one hit with a Pokeball, when a business owner verbally stopped me in front of her storefront. A spirited conversation followed, which I'll summarize below:

--""Hey, you should really start picking up your dog's sh*t.""

--An apologetic explanation that I already did so once, but today was a special kind of day involving an uncharacteristic bonus poo from my nine pound dog who doesn't normally pass half his weight in excrement.

--An accusation that I'm a liar and that she's previously spoken to me twice during the winter when my dog was dumping in the snow covered parking lots (this becomes important soon.)

--A threat to call the cops and tell my apartment manager of my behavior.

--A revelation that she's most likely referring to the other 6'5"" man with a Shih-Tzu that recently moved out of our building whom I met the other day.

958,"AITA for pushing my ‘sick’ girlfriend to be independent? Hi! 23 F here. First post and in desperate help if I’m an asshole…

My girlfriend “Jane” (22, F) and I have been dating for almost 6 months. Jane graduated college may 2019 and now is a swim teacher working 30 hours a week. Originally, she was attending community college to take classes for nursing, but she dropped them by October. Her reasoning was her chronic illness, called POTS. 

Jane’s main symptoms are intense pain in her body, shaking, problems with lightheadedness, etc. She usually has an episode about once a day, varying levels of pain and intensity. She’s been seeing doctors and takes medication. She quit nursing school to “focus more on herself” in September.

However, since then, Jane hasn’t really done a lot. She still works at the part time job and lives with her dad. When I try taking about her getting a job with reliable hours and benefits. She gets upset. 

 Early December, I tried helping her get a seasonal job to make some money in the meantime. She didn’t do it and cried when I tried to help her make some extra money with a dog walking app.
Before you all ask, yes, she is going to therapy. However, her therapist is on leave until March.

Am I the asshole because I push her and get mad when she doesn’t do anything? 

I want her to get a job with insurance and stop defining herself by her chronic illness. And I say this because I want the best for her as my partner and best friend. And yes, I believe Jane defines herself by her illness. I told her, and she agrees. Almost everything she does, she accompanies with how “useless” she is and “stupid” her body is because it doesn’t regulate right. She’s been working on her self-deprecating behavior, but this past weekend has been a tipping point. It’s out of control. All I want is the best for her. She’s my girlfriend and my best friend. I love spending time with her, and I care about her… but she just isn’t really trying.

Edit: I forgot to add I just want her to leave her current living situation because her dad is emotionally abusive.  This is why I want her to be independent.

Edit: I swear guys I do help her. I got her an interview with a nonprofit in the area, I send her job postings frequently and help her with her resume.","Yta. I have POTS myself, hallo! And boy do you come off as not getting the picture. 

>She still works at the part time job and lives with her dad. When I try taking about her getting a job with reliable hours and benefits. She gets upset. 

Because she isn't or isn't yet in the position to do that. Many people including myself aren't able to work at all, so I compliment her on doing something. This is btw of the main reason what POTS is, which you didn't describe. 

POTS is an autonomic nerve system syndrome which effects you highly in any upwards position but especially when walking and standing. When in that position the blood that comes upwards from your legs in the blood cycles isn't able to do this properly. That blood isn't able to reach your heart and brain properly which makes your heartbeat rise with at least over 30 beats within a timeframe of 10 mins (I have had heartbeats over 170). This can lead to a lot of things including fainting. It also causes consistent persistent symptoms.

>make some extra money with a dog walking app

So things like this are not helping. Have you even considered things like asking her what she needs of you? Like maybe compassion?

>Am I the asshole because I push her and get mad when she doesn’t do anything? 

Yes. Especially because you get mad. 

>I want her to get a job with insurance and stop defining herself by her chronic illness. 

That's not how it works though. Just because you want that doesn't mean she can do that. She can't right now. 

Your need for her to stop defining herself what you claim is you wanting to pretend it isn't there. You don't want it to be a thing. It is. 

Chronic illness and it's symptoms is something that somebody experiences 24/7. You don't want it to be defining but an illness like this impacts everything and in every situation you have to factor this in. It is that big of deal. In my case most of the time this factoring in turned into a low hassle routine but that has to be made. Until you get used to it, it will all feel very defining. And it will never not be a part of you. 

>with how “useless” she is and “stupid” her body is because it doesn’t regulate right. 

Because we live in a society that teaches illnesses are weaknesses it will impact self worth. You are in no way helping her with this because you are telling her too that you feel she is worthless as is.

>but she just isn’t really trying.

No you aren't trying. Cause in the end this isn't about her, this is about you. You can't seem to accept a life that involves illnesses. You are the one creating issues to maintain what you had and are not accepting what is. And it is you who has the decision to make about whether you can accept the very real effects of chronic illnesses on your life. You're not an asshole for not being able to have a relationship with someone with chronic illness. You are the asshole for blaming her for it, for being I'll though.",1,YTA,1.0,1.0,0

963,"AITA for using my parents-in-law’s money to buy a car they didn’t want us to buy? My wife and I needed a new car and up until now we have always paid them cash. We find cheap cars that seem reliable. That normally gets us semi-decent cars, but we’re in our second year of marriage and we don’t need anything fancy so it works.

My wife’s family is pretty strong, financially speaking. They’ve helped us in many ways. When they learned we needed a new car they offered their help once again. Her father told us what car we should look for and they both wanted us to buy something new. Well, that’s not something we wanted to do. First of all, it’s way too expensive to buy a brand new car and we didn’t want to use that much of their money. And second, we were confident in our ability to find a car that is affordable and performs well. They were insistent on buying a brand new car, so when my wife and I went out to look for cars, we decided to meet in the middle and get something newer than what we have gotten before (meaning more expensive) but still pre-owned.

Now, I absolutely hate the process of car shopping. It’s annoying to find something reasonably priced, dealing with salespeople is bothersome, and the entire process takes so long. Since it takes so long to find the right car, I’m willing to settle for something more expensive instead of continuing the search.  While my wife and I still try to be prudent in our decisions, I just want to avoid spending the entire day looking at different cars. After looking at 2 cars total, we decided on one and bought it.

My parents in law found out (after the fact) what car we got and got upset. They said that we didn’t even take the time to see what our options were, that we should have spent more time on it, and were upset that we got a pre-owned vehicle and that we put a down payment on it (they told us not to, idk why). Her dad threatened to not help pay for it. My wife got upset at him too, because she (and I) feel it’s not fair for them to offer their money then react this way. Then again, we didn’t use their money (that they haven’t even given us yet) the way they asked us to, so we kind of locked them into this. AITA?

Note: we supplied the down payment, her parents are only helping with monthly payments.

EDIT: the car we bought was 2018 model, so it was still really new, even if not brand new. We felt it was close enough, that it will perform similarly to a new car but still not an outrageously priced car that depreciates as soon as you drive it off the lot. Also I should not have said we told them “after the fact” because we were on the phone with them on and off through the whole process and talked with them about what we were doing. It was only after we actually bought it that they got so mad.","YTA. Sounds like a conditional gift; they are not obligated to help you if you violated the terms offered.

I’ve always told her I don’t have any problems with dudes talking to her, hitting on her, buying her drinks, or dancing with her. She’s attractive and it’s gunna happen.

Fast forward 7 months and she comes in with a few friends and some dude I’ve never met, who she says her and her friends always questioned if he’s gay. So her and this dude are standing in front of my well (and she’s more drunk than normal) as I’m doing my thing. I notice this guys hands are all over her. Like for an extended period of time. Touching her sides, waist, ass. Ok, I don’t do or say anything. They go away and later dance in these elevated platforms. (She used to be in a dance troop) the dancing is overtly sexual. Grinding, dropping her ass, his hands are still all over her. Coworker comes up to me and asks “are you and so&so still seeing each other?” And I look up and see all this.

Needless to say I wasn’t thrilled and we had words. Starting with “wtf are you doing” & “what are you talking about what’s wrong”. Ultimately I chilled out bc If he’s gay then whatever. But still quite aggressive touching for liking another sex. I have never touched a gender I’m not interested in like this.

Fast forward. She comes in again with a bunch of old coworkers and I take care of them. Don’t see much of any of them as it was packed so I assume she’s dancing. When I did see her on the dance floor she’s dancing with some dude doing the shit she does with me, dropping her and bringing it back up on my dick and grinding on me and shit. Ok. Now I’m getting irritated. 

Argument starts after she leaves “what the fuck did I do this time?” I’m like are you kidding me. I know I said I don’t care about you dancing with other dudes but where’s the line? There’s no difference between how you’re dancing with him and with me”. Responding with “oh that’s just so&so’s friend he’s my old dance choreographer” or whatever.

965,"AITA for not tipping a bartender I used to flirt with? There's this really attractive female bartender that works at the main bar next to my university. I (male) have been talking/flirting with her for the past few months every weekend that I go out. Typically, I'll be completely belligerent though and I usually struggle to remember our conversations the next day. Also, the bar gets packed and it's difficult to talk to her in the first place. 

I never really thought about making a move for a few reasons.
1. She's seen me hit on other girls consistently for the past few months.
2. She's older than me, working at a bar, and I assumed she didn't want anything to do with a guy still in college.
3. I didn't want to make things weird at the bar I frequent so often (shitting where you eat kinda thing)

However, recently she followed me on Instagram at like 4am without even knowing my username meaning she looked up my name (that she knew from my credit card). Also, the other bartenders told me and my friends that she was talking about me to them.

So I got hopeful and decided to message her on Instagram. She left me on seen then replied days later. I waited a few days and replied just to be left on seen again. I didn't really think anything of it, but then the next time I went to the bar, we barely talked and then she stopped serving me drinks because I was ""too drunk"" apparently. She went so far as to tell all the other bartenders not to serve me. I think this is because I didn't tip her since I was upset that she wasn't messaging me back. 

I was pissed off at this point and it probably showed. I was told later that I left the bar when it closed flipping off all the employees saying ""I'm never coming back to this shitty bar ever again""

Then I unfollowed her on Instagram but she stayed following me.

Next weekend, I saw her and tried getting a drink from her. She walked right by and took everyone elses drink orders except mine. Finally she got to me so I asked if she was going to cut me off again. She said she would if I kept giving her attitude. I was taken aback and just bluntly told her to get me my drink. She slid me my drink and the check without even looking at me and walked away without saying another word. Again, I didn't tip her. 

I messaged her later that night asking why she was acting like that - just for her to leave me on seen again. I was blacked out drunk at this point so I got mad and decided to just block her completely. Today I unblocked her though and there was an unread message from later that night saying I was the one acting out, not her.

So AITA for not tipping her? Or is she the asshole for following me on Instagram just to not reply to my messages then give me the cold shoulder when she saw me? Judging by her actions, it seems like she was only talking/flirting with me before because I tipped her well. Then as soon as I tried talking to her outside of work / not tipping her, she felt no reason to be nice so she started being an asshole towards me. Curious to see what y'all think!

Manager said sure. Sweet.

Day comes around and I'm working from 6 til around 1:30. It's about 1:15 and we are super busy slammed, but I'm looking forward to going home. Manager comes around to the kitchen and informs me that we are way too busy and needs me to stay later than planned. When asked how long, I got a measly ""We'll see."" 

Time goes by and orders get pushed through. Another 2 hours goes by. All of sudden we all hear a glass break out in the dining room. No biggie, things happen. Well apparently, a little bit of glass found its way into the foot of one of the young female waitresses. Now when I say little I mean, the thing was like a paper cut. Regardless, she completely overreacted and was going on about how she couldn't walk on her foot and she needed stitches and etc. Etc. Manager decides, well that's fine, you can go home and I'll just keep one of the cooks here later to balance it out. That cook ended up being me and I was asked to stay until our closing time of 10pm. 

Don't get me wrong, any other day I probably would have been a little upset but hey, its whatever. However, the fact that in 3 weeks advanced I asked for the shift switch, and to get off at 1:30pm only to be told I am staying the entire 6am-10pm shift, on my birthday when I had already made reservation plans with family and friends? I was livid. I exchanged a few heated words back and forward about how shes even able to go home due to a little paper cut. Things got more elevated and in a stupid fit of rage I knocked over a few things like a microwave and a toaster (both of them breaking) as well as boxes of bowls and lids in frustration.

People didn't want anything to do with this arrogant, sippy-straw visioned fuck that was full of himself, and every time I mention his name in any of my friend groups, they all groan as if I just shouted the most horrific shit within the voice channel.

---

""But OP,"" you may ask, ""if he's such an asshole and treats almost everybody this way, why didn't you cut relations with him earlier?""

Well, the thing is, it's not like he's had it easy. The guy's got a family therapist, his dad is one of those extreme-traditional-mindset-asian-fathers that go apeshit crazy or just straight up don't make sense. Worst I've heard from him was when Barney got kicked out of the house with his father screaming that **""If I knew you were going to be such a disobedient child, I would've drowned you as a kid!""**

He also has a bit of good in him, as since I've stuck around to see how he's managed to evolve from his wannabe-gangster-unhealthy-loyalty-expectation high school self, he can still truly genuinely care about people. When he visited a month back, he really wanted to ask me to hang out. Being the person I am, I can't really deny without any good reason, so I took him out, we ate at a small diner, and he asked me how to take care of a long distance relationship/friendship, and no bullshit, no interruption, he sternly asked for my advice on how to manage a long distance relationship/friendship as someone he dearly cares about is studying abroad and they both recently confessed to each other that they have mutual affection. The amount of focus he gave me was as if he was a completely different person. No smug look, no snapback, no dumb conclusions, just listened to what I had to say, and I genuinely was glad to help him out. It's as if Barney had changed overnight.

It's not the only times it seemed to happen. When he's upset, he trusts me with a lot of his information, his secrecy, his privacy, et cetera. Sometimes it's as if I never had met the guy.

Those moments in which I still saw the person that could lie within, and I hoped to coax that out with years of experience, telling him that the way he talks and the way he goes about using words can sometimes really hurt people, and that it's easily misconstrued to a point in which could definitely could rub off as extremely rude and aggressive. I tell him that using ""k"" to deal with/run away from your problems isn't a valid option when you hit adulthood, and that you should always keep an open mind no matter how angry you can possibly get, and to be fair, he has improved on that vastly since the time I first ran into him in high school. I really wanted this guy to turn over a new leaf and perhaps rebuild friendships that were once torn apart by his irrationality/ignorance, as I knew that there was a chance. A low chance, but a chance nonetheless. I stuck by him for years, defending him and telling him what he could've done better, or when to let things go when they're out of his control so he won't let his emotions get to him.

---

But, other times, things just get way out of hand and I just don't want to deal with it for the millionth time in a row. I've seen this guy tear apart his own relationships with others and be completely oblivious of why, then proceed to blame those that ""wronged"" him, or tell them that he himself wasn't even angry and that it was them who blew things out of proportion, while using a 110% aggressive tone the message before. There's no in-between with this guy. He wants in with almost everything I do, and it's almost creeping me out at this point how many times I've seen him say ""hmu if you want to ______"" when there is nothing new in my mundane college life, in which I remind him of almost every week. He has a sick/extreme definition of loyalty in which he expects constant attention from those he talks to the most, and even tries to guilt trip those he **weren't** close with at all, with sayings that usually ended up with a meaning that revolved around **""k I thought we were close but I guess not.""**

On the 20th of November 2017, I was having one of the roughest days of the month--woke up with a cramp to start the day off that wouldn't go away, then forgot all my assignments at home, then realized I read the instructions on how to enroll in the Spring Semester for my university, got smacked around/yelled at by my father, threatened to get beaten, then was the punching bag of my grandmother and her insane assumptions on how the family mistreated her because she didn't get the dumpling she wanted in her bowl. 

Barney has a terrible habit of responding to somebody on a messenger, then just going offline.

---

***Example:***

Barney: ""Hey, so are we hanging out on Sunday?""

Me: ""I dunno, you think you have time after Church? Do get back to me quick though, I'm a little busy and on break""

**5 hours later--** Barney: ""Yeah, I don't have church on that day lol""

---

So, when I got home that day and went upstairs, I didn't want to do anything. My friend group I usually play Counter Strike with asked if I wanted to get a game or two in, and I thought to myself, ""why not? I'll just channel this anger into my aim, perhaps.""

The first game was great, despite the tie, and Barney was still idling around with an ""Away"" status until the end of the game, in which he entered this software called ""Wallpaper Engine"". I'm assuming he's busy, considering he **still** hadn't replied to my message in which I sent as a reply to his initial inquiry, 3 hours prior. Then, when I begin queueing for a game, he messages me, obviously annoyed, with his irking start of **""bruh""** along with the lines of **""not even an inv?...""** followed, with my attempts of telling him that I was already in a full lobby (in vain, of course), by more assumptions, such as **""w/e kid""** and a slew of **""k""** responses.

He had not messaged me beforehand, it was 10:30, I was just about bringing my mood up since I had a terrible day since the moment I woke up, I drank a few shots of Moscato, I was absolutely exhausted, I didn't need this, so as I was playing, I just started to give him a taste of his own medicine, only replying with ""k"" as I was sick and tired of seeing him revert to his man-child self that I tried so hard to eliminate within his toxic personality.

He proceeds to spam with a bunch of ""k"" responses that filled up the entire right hand screen of my monitor, popping a few ""lol idc"" messages in for good measure, and after he was done, stopped messaging me altogether. 

I didn't attempt to apologize. I muted him on Facebook so he wouldn't ruin my sleep, so he can complain to his little girlfriend across the atlantic ocean on FaceTime a little more than usual.

So, with all that said, AITA for giving up on this guy? At this rate, since I'm not apologizing, there's a 90% chance I'll never talk to him again. AITA for befriending him, sticking by him through thick and thin (and bullshit), being there when he needed the help/attention, but ultimately just shoved him aside when I couldn't stand thinking of another second dealing with his immaturity? Should I have let him go earlier? Should I have kept on trying?

Am I the Asshole?","It sounds to me like you've been really grossly dishonest with him. From your stories, you despise him, you've always despised him, you thought you might not despise him for a little bit and then you went right back to despising him, yet you never had the decency to cut contact earlier or try and tell him what you had an issue with. You phrased it as universal statements. Who seriously thinks that using the word 'k' as a response is ""running away from your problems""? What you MEANT was, ""Barney, when you only reply with 'k' it makes me feel like you're dismissing me and it upsets me"". So why didn't you say that?

You sound like you've been keeping this guy around so you can prove you've got someone you're better than. So every time you talk to him you can go 'well, at least I'm not that guy'. The way you describe yourself as his mentor, like you're this benevolent god bestowing knowledge upon him, is ridiculous. 

You accuse him of expecting others to read his mind, but I never saw an occasion in your story when you sat down and said, ""Barney, it upsets me when you do X because I feel X"". ""Barney, I'm worried about you because of X, I really feel you could do X."" 

Instead, you and your little friends just sit around up your own ass about how much better you are than this guy.

Every single thing you say he does, you do too. Here's an example.

>even tries to guilt trip those he weren't close with at all

And you say to him

>So you're literally calling the person who's stuck by you for years on end off

You guilt tripping asshole. You have no qualms about doing the exact same shit he does when it suits your needs, but yeah, you're SO morally superior to him. In your sweet little story about how he's finding love and mutual affection, you sound like you almost tolerate the poor sap, and then at the end you butcher it by whining about him and ""his little girlfriend across the Atlantic ocean"".

I'd say you're both assholes, because he sounds difficult to deal with too.

But honestly? At least he doesn't sit around and circlejerk about how awesome he is and how this person he knows is just scum.

tl;dr: You're an asshole for keeping around someone that you loathe for the sole purpose of shitting on him and pretending you're being benevolent about it. ",1,YTA,0.0,0.0,0

985,"AITA for calling my brother ""gay"" in his bithday card? The title says the most, but here's a bit mory story to it. My brother just turned 17. I wrote a simple postcard to him, saying pretty much just ""Happy pirthday, gay"" (Works better in my language :D). 

My mom posted a picture of the card to facebook (Wich i did not want, since i knew that there is gonna be someone with a problem, but this woman posts every dang thing, but i didn't realize this) and some not that close friend of hers came with a really long text about How she feels bad for her gay friends.

The thing is, I'm gay. I've been calling my brother that for many years as a joke, but don't usually bring it to the public. He is a very masculine straight guy, with lets say, strong opinions towards sexual, gender and racial minorities. He's not neccesarely a homophobe or a racist, but likes to talk shit (he knows that I'm gay, and has zero problem with this).

At a certain point i get the ""gay isn't a slur"", wich is true, but i've never met a person, part of a sexual minority offended by this. Personally I even find those ""That's gay"" Or ""No u"" type of jokes funny, used in a somehow original place. Being straight just is the norm, and words like gay have always been a joke slur, and i don't see this as a problem. I'm proud to be gay, but it's really not that big.

I find that these people saying, that using gay as a funny slur are mostly straight hypocrits, who are just trying to show people how they are so damn great and accepting. I really wanted to blow at this woman for being a hypocrit (Of course this might just be my opinion), but i felt like I'm gonna fuck something up for this woman by doing so.

I made half chocolate chip, half real pieces of chocolate bar pieces chocolate chip cookies. 


They turned out so delicious! I was so proud of myself that I handed them out to everyone at work. Mind you, I told everyone that they were only allowed to take one. I, myself had eaten three.


By the end of the day, there were only 3 left, and my boyfriend said that they were delicious,and he was grateful, but he wished that I had thought to leave more for him.


We both don't like fighting, so we agreed this was not important enought to start a fuss over, but I just want to know if I'm in the wrong here. 


Additional info: He says I am a textbook people pleaser, which he says he both loves and hates about me, and he stated this is one of those situations where he hates it.

987,"AITA for calling myself a nanny when my boss doesn’t want me to? For the past 6 months, once a week I watch a baby boy for the entire day. His mom is a stay at home mom that takes that day to do other stuff. I have another job the other 4 to 5 days (depending on the schedule I’m given) to supplement my income. It’s been a great arrangement, she pays me well. When she hired me, she never gave me an exact title, which I didn’t need. However, if someone asks me what I do for a living, I typically say retail worker and part time nanny. I didn’t think it was a big deal.

Until my boss told me it got back to her I was calling myself the baby’s nanny. I guess someone I work with in retail knows her and recognized the little guy on my phone. She said she didn’t like people thinking she had a nanny and “frankly, you’re not one”. To me, I watch her son on a consistent basis, paid what a nanny in our area would an hour. That’s a nanny. To her other kids in school, I consider myself a babysitter since I only watch them occasionally.

I told her that I was sorry she was so upset, but didn’t confirm or deny that I’d stop. I don’t know why she got so upset and honestly, it made me upset how offended she seemed by this. It rarely comes up, but what does it matter? I tried to figure it out and ultimately, it boiled down to “I just don’t want people thinking I have a nanny.” I think it’s an image thing.

988,"AITA For telling my Ex's Partner to stop mothering my kids? TA. She's on reddit.

Jim (M40) and his partner, Sally (F29), 2gether 5yrs, have custody of our 2 eldest kids (8-6) while I try to move closer to them.I (F30) live 3hrs away and its been hard to find a home in 2 yrs. I have no car to make house viewing so Sally and Jim go for me. But realtors want to see the person who plans to rent. I catch a bus down, every month, with our 3yr and stay at a friends while the 3yr stays with them.

Anyway, Sally is nice, though I don't really like her I am civil, she looks after the kids, cooks for them, helps them read. She lent me money to take my daughter to the movies for her bday. Her family treats the kids as though they were blood (they are really close- community to raise a child sorta family) and live only 15mins away from her. While mine don't want much to do with them and Jims parents are in their 80's and have no patience for kids

So I got a call from a friend saying she had seen Sally and Jim out with the kids and that she was mothering them, that Sally is helping at the kids school, and making friends with the parents. My 3yr old, isnt blood to Jim but has his last name, kept asking to see her 'poppa' and 'nana'. Sallys parents, I was told the other grandkids call them that so mine mustve picked it up. It really angers me. I called Sally and told her that they are MY kids, they have no relation to her at all! The kids are to call her parents by name. That she needs to stop parenting MY kids. I am their mother, not her. Sally was hurt and Jim was angry, he said that of course she is going to parent the kids, but she has always made it clear she is their 'co-parent' and that she loves them as if they were her own but they have a mum. 

Jim said Sally doesn't have to let Him use her car to get them to school, or drive them to see me (he pointed out i dont pay for gas or wear'n'tear on the car), that she doesn't have to send me photos of the kids, Jim doesnt have aphone, or answer when I call. That Sally changed everything in her life for my kids, turning the spareroom from her personal area to a bedroom, getting a 4door car to fit 3 carseats/boosters, making allergy sensitive meals for my daughters and sharing her living space everyday. 

I feel like I'm right, they are my kids, even though they live in her house. She shouldn't be at their school, talking to the other parents and volunteering. She shouldn't be telling my kidsto say Pardon instead of What, thats MY job. Her parents shouldn't be so involved, she should just let them live there and Jim be just the Dad.

&#x200B;

My sister and I left our homes to help look. I texted my two closest friends a brief rundown and ask for them to call me in an hour to check up on me. One friend, B, texted back saying that she would try, but she might fall asleep. My other friend, O, does not answer. It was 9 pm at this time.

The nursing home is a new build, surrounded by unfinished suburban home construction, four lane roads/highways, woods, and dead ends. At around 9:41 pm, I stumble and nearly fall into a large hole.

Edit: yes, my kids (and both of us) got the flu shot this year, as soon as it came out. I would never intentionally expose someone, but I thought once the fever was gone, they weren’t contagious. For those saying not to expose anyone, how long do I wait? A week? A month?

Edit 2: my sister didn’t specifically state we couldn’t come. She just said she could bring their presents another time since we wouldn’t be able to make it. I said well, if they’re better in 4 days, we could still make it. She said if they have ANY symptoms, even a sniffle, not to come. The problem with that is my daughter has year-round allergies and asthma, so she’s always got sniffles. That’s why I was going by the fever rule. But I get that the consensus is I am TA, so I shall keep them home. Thanks for the input.

Edit 3: I am immunocompromised and could end up in the hospital if I catch this from them. So I totally understand not spreading it around. I honestly thought the ‘rule’ was that if there was no fever, you weren’t contagious. I was wrong, so we’re staying home.

Edit 4: (sorry for all the edits) a simple google search could’ve prevented this post, So I apologize. It says you’re contagious from 1 day before symptoms then for 5-7 days. So Christmas Day is definitely out, as well as the party the next day with the in-laws (oh darn-lol).","YTA you're literally uninvited.

995,"AITA for keeping my daughter from meeting her favorite author? AITA for keeping my daughter from meeting her favorite author?

Background: I homeschool my children. They do a lot of world schooling and they do very little ""sit down work"" much of their school work is very hands on and interactive. We use programs outside of school hours as part of our school instruction and take every opportunity as learning. On a whole they do much less work than other kids their age so when I tell them to do something I expect it done. 

My 9 year old is obsessed with books called The Magic Treehouse and we went to NYC today so she could see the author and get a picture with her.

Her younger sisters came with us but were not as interested and excited as she was.

During the program they asked the kids to practice writing a story and said for those that can't write they could draw a story. I told my 9 year old she needed to write (she HATES writing assignments. She will write her own comics all day but screams and throws a fit with assigned writing. 

She started to pout and stomp during the program that she was not writing and she was drawing a picture. I told her she would regret it and that no matter what she would be doing writing today so please do this project now. She refused and sat there with her arms crossed. 

As I suspected after the writing time they allowed kids to stand up and read their story to Mary Pope Osborne. My dd started crying yer eyes out and rushed into writing 2 horrible sentences and wanted to raise her hand to read. I put my hand on top of hers and said ""no you did not do the work you rushed through this and have something incomprehensible you will not be reading now""

She started wailing. Not just crying but sobbing loudly.

I took her out and warned her to get herself together. Sent her to the bathroom to wash her face and told her she had 5 minutes to get herself together. She continued to cry louder. So I picked up my other children and we left. She was screaming crying on the way out about not getting a picture with the author.

I felt so torn. On one hand I could have just let her read her thrown together 2 sentences. She would have been happy and no one would have said anything. On the other hand she refused to listen and do the work in writing something even when I as her teacher/mom told her to do it 4 times and I don't feel bad work should be rewarded. 

She wrote the piece in the car and we went to a reptile expo with the rest of the day so the day was not ruined, but I can't  shake the feeling that maybe I was too mean to her and I should have just let her read her thing and meet the author.

However, their teacher likes to give me a hard time when I come in to eat and chat with them, even though I had asked the teacher for permission before I started doing so (however there was a misunderstanding and we resolved it).

The teacher likes to make comments like:
- where I should be right now
- why I don't just go to lunch and eat by myself
- To clean up after myself
- Etc.

My responses:
- I already told him that I have free periods and that I am just here to eat and chill with my friends
- I told him that if he wanted I could eat in that lunch, it wasn't big deal and he always responded that ""it was fine""
- I always cleaned up after myself, but he constantly reminds me to and makes small comments about how his room is dirty

For background, my family immigrated from China and now my mom is now helping her college friend (Cathy) from China by letting them stay at our house for a while. She also brought her son (Sean) over but the dad is not in the picture at all. Apparently she got fanatical about Buddhism and lived in the middle of nowhere so my mom decided to have Sean checked out by her doctor. The doctor said that Sean displays many symptoms of Marfan syndrome and he seriously needs to be checked out. I thought it is an extremely seriously issue and Sean needs to be tested right away and Cathy needs to know. However, she refuses to let Cathy or Sean know. She argues that they have no heath insurance and no money so even if she tried to let Cathy know, she wouldn’t have the vast amount of money to treat Sean anyway and they don’t need the extra stress right now.

I tried to tell her that it’s morally wrong to keep this from Cathy but she wouldn’t do it so I left it at that. I told this to my friends and they are telling me that I should surpass my mother and just tell Cathy anyway. This is going to sound cold but I don’t think it’s my responsibility and I do have agree that if they have no money or health insurance, telling them wouldn’t do anything either way.

1017,"AITA For not really wanting to leave my room on holiday? So apologies for formatting, on mobile and all that.

Context: Every year (for the past 6-7 years) my family goes on holiday for a couple weeks to a small cottage in France, we've been to this place a lot and the village is quite rural so WiFi, 4G, phone signal are all quite underwhelming. Also, there isn't much to do in the village itself. I've never really been a fan of holidays myself very much so I've always semi dreaded it and usually not enjoyed it much. My parents know this as I've said it on previous holidays. Now onto this particular year.

This year I was meant to be bringing a friend along with me, however he couldn't afford to take the time of work. A second friend was asked with the same reasoning for being unable to come. A third friend was asked but he also said no and a fourth friend also said no after about 2 weeks of deliberation. This brings us to around 3 weeks to a month before we leave. Now here's where I think I may be the asshole, I'd assumed that at this point I had to just suck it up and go, however I didn't properly (or even attempt really) to communicate the fact I didn't want to go without my friends (it would just be my parents, and me) and as I said I just assumed I would have to put up. Added context: the day before we left I'd asked a girl out on a date and she said no which made me feel a little more depressed than usual. In the end I think I only told my dad I didn't want to go about 20 mins before we left (reason 1 for me maybe being TA). This sentiment was repeated on the ferry when my dad said ""you really don't wanna be here do you?""

Edit: I was being very quiet and sort of mopey (I think is a good word) at this point

For extra details: I'm an introvert who likes to play video games online with friends, so rural France isn't great already. The fact that shops and other attractions barely fit that field of interest kinda stumps anything to do.

So far we're about 4-5 days in and I've not left my room a whole bunch and my parents seem to be getting a bit annoyed/frustrated (I'm not good at reading emotions so I don't really know) at that fact. My feelings of not wanting to leave my room however were a small bit amplified when my dad said the reason I was rejected was I put myself in the friendzone (I already dislike the friendzone term so that wasn't cool), that I won't be able to get and keep a girlfriend if I keep playing video games, and that I'm not introverted because I have sarcasm. This resulted in me kind of shutting in a bit more and just doing what I do at home.

Kind of petty and complicated I know, but AITA?

  I decided to call LO (Loved One) up since they wanted to call so they could continue what they were already focusing on which was just fine. Some time into the call they began explaining what they were working on since we disagreed on something related to it. All I said was “It’s not really fun listening to explanations after sitting through them all day, but hey, it’s whatever.” Which was replied with LO saying “Whenever you talk or complain about things I listen to you” which I understand all in all but said “You don’t have to if you don’t want to, I tell you that all the time” in which I do.
  Which I think is just true since I usually ask if LO is sure they want to hear about what I’m gonna talk about if I know it can be complaining.

We have been through a lot but lately she has been belittling me and not handling her expectations. Back during Christmas she left me while we visited my dad's side of my family. A week later we made up and she announced our engagement. She had been feeling unwell and we found out she was pregnant. I'm nervous and unsure about wanting to be a father buy I've told her I will support her. I've been struggling with depression a lot, I think as a result of her leaving me back in December and my medication no longer working for me. I've started hanging put with friends 4 times a week because seeing my fiancee stresses me out. 

Lately I have not been able to care about us as much as I want to. She's repeatedly bossed me around and told me that I should sleep early or eat better because it will help me. She has tried repeatedly to make me see my psychiatrist, but I'm busy. She struggles from depression and she functions differently. I just wish to be alone right now, so I traveled out to see my mom and I've been staying at her place for a week. Last night my fiancee called to say she felt very depressed and she was afraid she would hurt herself. I was angry and told my mom how I felt. She said that my fiancee was being selfish and needed to back off because she was trying to manipulate me. I decided to call her and see what was wrong. She pretty much told me that she was very depressed and needed me to come back home. I told her I needed to think about it some more. 

This morning she texted me and told me that I needed me to come home and start doing things to fix our relationship or she would leave. I told her she was being selfish and she was only pushing me farther away. About an hour later she called me and I  was ignoring her because I was out getting dinner with my mom. She called my mom thirty minutes later and I told my mom to ignore her too. Eventually she messaged my mom and asked her to tell me to please give her a call. My mom was mad at my fiancee and she told her I needed some time to be alone and I would come home when I was stronger and such.

 My mom also told her that she was making this all about herself and being selfish because I have a right to spend time away from her if I need it. Because my mom has been supportive of me seeking time away from my fiancee, my fiancee accused her of ""setting me up to fail"". When I lived with my mother I had a history of sleeping in during the day and going out at night. My mother was the same, it is how I was raised and I trust her because she also suffers from depression. I know my mother would never do that and she was outraged that my fiancee would accuse her of being a poor parent. She told my fiancee to fuck off and that she would make a terrible mother to our child. I was also outraged that my fiancee would accuse my mother of being a bad mother.

1027,"AITA for finding a comendian on a dating app and asking him if a joke was real? So this happened recently when i went to a comedy gig. The headline act was a gay guy (based on the jokes though he could have potentially been bi idk). He was extremely funny and also witty to hecklers and it was an all-round great show. The venue itself did 4-pint pitchers and by the time the show ended we (me and my BF) were on our third pitcher.

&#x200B;

After his set i thought it might be interesting to see if he was actually still on Grindr and, low and behold, he was! He didn’t have a FP but his profile and distance (closer than my BF despite him being sat next to me) made us 99% sure it was him. 

&#x200B;

So I dropped him a message saying Hi and that we really enjoyed his set but got ignored. 

&#x200B;

One of his jokes was about his Hemoriods so after about 30 mins of me and my BF chatting I checked and still had no response so i sent him a final message saying “I guess I’m not your type but really enjoyed your set. Btw was your joke about haemorrhoids real? I showed my BF and he said that was completely out of order and I should block him before he sees at as it’s not only rude but an invasion of privacy to hunt him down on an app and ask him about something so personal. He also said that I could damage his mental wellbeing by simply asking that. 

&#x200B;

Being sober now I know I wouldn’t have sent it had I not been drunk but I don’t believe it was that bad. What do you guys think? AITA?

For context after i messaged him first, my BF sent something similar. He too was ignored.

1032,"AITA because my boyfriend has no friends? This one definitely needs some detail. 

I, 20sF, moved to the city 3 years ago and have been in the same job since. It was hard but I’ve made some great friends here, and we socialise pretty often. 

My boyfriend, 30sM, moved back to the city 2 years ago from overseas. We’ve been together a year.

We moved in together 9 months ago, and bought a house 6 months ago. We had a party when we moved in, and I invited my workmates, all of whom he knows and has socialised with. 

He mentioned inviting his workmates, but I said I didn’t know them and I would like to meet them before they came to our house. He seemed okay with this. 

Since then, he’s gone out with them a few times, and I’ve met them once. He mentioned inviting them over and I said sure. 

Today is his birthday party, and he asked me to invite my workmates. I did, but most of them are  busy or ill. I asked how many of his were coming. He said none because it was too hard to ask them. He said that because they haven’t come to our earlier party, it would have been awkward to ask them to this one. When pressed, he said he was the only one of his group who wasn’t asked to an engagement party. 

It was clear he thought his lack of friends was my fault.

I said ‘couldn’t it be unrelated? That it could be because you are leaving soon? Or that you’re just not close?’. 

I said ‘despite what’s happened in the past, you could have sent them a message or talked to them and invited them, or asked me to do it.’

He didn’t want to push it further, because he didn’t want conflict.

> but I said I didn’t know them and I would like to meet them before they came to our house

This strikes me as odd that you feel the need to screen your bf's friends before they're allowed to come over. It seems kind of controlling. What if you didn't like them but your bf did? Would they never be allowed over? I get that you live there, too, but why don't you trust your bf to invite over people if he believes they are good people?

Even your title is odd: ""AITA because my bf has no friends?"" It sounds almost..petty.. He does have friends. Maybe not close ones, but it's weird that you would say that. I might be reading too much into it though.

1035,"AITA for refusing to acknowledge my roommate's friend? My boyfriend and I (22F) moved in with his HS best friend (Jason, 25M) to save money until I’m done with my internship. My boyfriend has a friend group composed of liberal and “woke” people. There’s this girl, (let’s call her Em) who started to get close to Jason. Jason likes her but is too cautious to try anything since Em still has a boyfriend of 3 years. The boyfriend doesn’t like our roommate and it caused tension in their relationship. Now, since two weeks ago, I come home and find Em chilling the in couch and staying until past midnight just talking to jason. Like literally just talking and I can hear them through the walls when I try to fall asleep. I really think she’s shady AF by how she conducted herself around our roommate, especially knowing that she broke up with her boyfriend to be with him. I’m also pretty sure Jason gave her the keycode to get past the apt gate and that makes me super uncomfortable. Now she’s over practically every other day and I can’t even be comfortable when I go outside my room to be in the kitchen. I didn’t signed up to live with a 4th person and this girl has a house. A HOUSE to go to instead of here.

Everytime I see her in the apt., I don’t talk to her or acknowledge her. Our roommate made us aware that I was giving off the “cold vibes” and that it made her feel unwelcome. I said i didn’t really care since I wasn’t the one who keeps inviting herself to the apt all the time. I know my animosity against Em could caused my bf to be isolated from his friend group. I really don’t care about his friend group but I know it’ll make him sad if he is pushed out because of me. I’ve told my bf about my bad feelings about her and he understood. He also doesn’t like her but he knows she’s an integral part of his friend group.

Should I be nice to Em for the sake of my bf even though she’s SHADY AF? Or confront my roommate on how she makes me uncomfortable knowing that it could cause my bf to potentially lose his friends?

&#x200B;

EDIT: I know their relationship is none of my business and that it's not my place to judge. I acknowledge that. But every fiber of my being cannot like this girl. I just don't and I have tried to vibe with her and it doesn't feel genuine so I stopped long time ago. Also note that I don't go out in my way to be mean to her. I have never said anything that's rude or curse at her. I just don't make an effort to talk to her because, again, she's not my guest nor did I invite her over.

EDIT: When I have guests over, I don't expect my roommate to talk to them, even small talk, or even interact with them because I am the one who invited them over (after giving him a heads-up that people are coming over). I just don't understand why he expects me to talk to her and pretend I'm interested in whatever she says, and he never gives us the courtesy to let us know if he's inviting people over.

1036,"AITA For using dark jokes around my friend? We have a group of friends we always hang out with for almost two years. We like to make a lot of dark jokes including racism sexism and religious stuff. Sometimes we joke about our parents. We are in no way actually racist or sexist or have hatred against religous groups, we just like making jokes about them because we find them funny. Everyone laughs, no one seems to be offended by the joke and we have fun. Making dark jokes aren't only thing we do, I'm just keeping this story short. 

One night I messaged a friend in that group online. We just began some generic small talk and started a converasation. Dark jokes did slip out once or twice. When I made a joke that his parents do cocaine, he lost it. He got really emotional and called me and my family a lot of bad words. He kept insulting me and of course I thought he was just joking around. I followed up with jokingly comments. He kept insulting me, and it gave me a hit that maybe he wasn't joking. I told him again, ""Stop acting like you're upset dude, it wont work on me. I'm not gonna apologize and let you make fun of me for doing so again""

He ignored me for a few minutes, I asked him if he was serious, and he did. Just now it hit me he was actually hurt by the comments. He apologized, I apologized but I'm not sure what to do in this situation. He told me that he has a tendency to hide his feelings, and that he secretely hated the comments and jokes all along. It's the first time he ever told me this. I told him ""You should have told me this way earlier"". He proceeded to say ""How can anyone find these jokes funny? You have to be really weird to find these funny"".

There has been a lot of more pressing issues that have arisen this year (serious health issues and job change) that made charging my roommates on venmo during the beginning of each month lower on my priority list. As such, 4 months of bills have gone uncharged. I, however, made the payments on time. I charged them this past month for the 4 months. I'm getting a lot of backlash, criticism, and am being called careless and not empathetic to think people can just hand over $350 all at once. I gave them the option to pay in installments over the month. But the tensions in the house are still high. One roommate insists she pay over the course of 4 months. I'm not comfortable with that because I don't feel comfortable with not getting my money, I can literally put that money anywhere else and I'll get more from it, and emotionally I don't feel obligated to do this. In fact, it makes me feel like a bank of convenience. I know money is hard.

Edit: I've brought up through the years that I don't like taking care of the bills because I have a few jobs, am managing some admin things long distance for family, and have recently gotten sick. Nobody was willing to take on the 'head of house' role or split up  the ownership of the bills because they 'don't want to be fronting money' and bc I made more than all of them. Also, I'm not asking for the money all at once. I said they could pay through 2 pay cycles (1 month). If they needed more time they could notify me so we can sort something out. I told them the bills were an anomaly 2 weeks before charging them (giving them a total of 6 weeks to prepare). All of them expressed criticism but nobody asked for any extensions.

For the past year and half she has been staying at my friends house wed - fri so rants she can get into the uni base as she live a good 45 minutes away by car ride and she hasn't got the money for fuel to do that trip 3 times a week sometimes 4 and that I totally understand that as fuel is pricey as hell atm.

Now this wouldn't bother honestly as I trust her and I trusted my friend as I've known the guy for almost 10 years but a couple months ago she came to me and told me he confessed that he has feeling for her and I'll be honest this has thrown me into a man child sulk ever since and whenever me or her brings up the topic of her staying there  I take it out on her by neing cold and mean and I know I shouldn't but I just have this bad feeling.

I really don't want my jealousy to destroy this relationship as I genuinely love this girl, Also im think of taking anger management classes as I had that problem as a teen and I don't want to fall back into that mind set again.

What do you fear will happen? That she will like him back if she spends more time with him? If you have that little trust in your gf, you can choose to work on that and keep trusting her, or break up. Do you fear that he'll make advances at her? People who don't have feelings for your gf will do the exact same thing. Nothing has changed between you not knowing and now knowing. 

It's ok to be insecure, but YTA because you actively ""take it out on her"" by being ""cold and mean"" and ""man child sulk"". What do you hope to accomplish with this? Make her coddle your insecurity forever until...what? You understand her circumstances and yet put her between a rock and a hard place because you don't want to manage your own emotions. This is not a grown up partner behavior, it's child behavior to a mom. What did she do to deserve mistreatment? Trust you and be honest to you enough to let you know that some other guy has confessed feelings. This is going to teach her never to trust you to be adult about your own feelings, never to be honest about her social relationships with you, and that having a man child as a partner is exhausting because she WILL have more people in her life have feelings for her and she doesn't deserve to be punished by her bf for it.

I (27 f) was recently left in a difficult financial situation when my ex of 5 years left me.

My mom texted me last night asking if I get long term disability insurance through my work (because if I don't, we will need to attach it to the mortgage). I didn't see the text until after 10:30 at night (I spent a good chunk of the evening cleaning and was not near my phone). I did read it, but decided to save responding until the morning (I fully admit my relationship with my mother is tense at the moment, as there have been MANY instances like this one, and many instances of her talking to my ex behind my back when I've asked her not to, and I just didn't want to get into an extended conversation with her late at night). Also, when I did not respond instantly, she emailed me as well. And sent it to me on Facebook. I also planned to email my workplace in the morning to double check (they respond very quickly), but my work email was not working in the evening, so I figured it would be better to save responding for when I could actually tell her what I'd done to find the answer to her question. When I woke up, I texted her to let her know what I was going to do, and sent off the email to work. When she responded she told me not to worry about it because she'd already contacted my union this morning to ask. I told her she was overstepping and being rude. She said ""Well I guess I am always going to be rude"" and that ""we are working against a timeline."" I pointed out that the timeline is not so short that it couldn't wait a single evening (which is very true, and besides, if I had responded, I wouldn't have been able to give her the answer until today anyway, given that the work office wasn't open that late, even if my email had been working). She said that I am I have called her rude and passive aggressive when she retreats (? not true, I have called her rude in a few situations, but she 'retreated' after, and 'retreat' for her is dropping passive aggressive comments to make me feel guilty, at which point I called her passive aggressive).

 So I picked him up at a random store. He gets in the car obviously high on meth basically crying telling me how sorry he is for everything he ever put me through.

1061,"AITA for asking my (24f) gf (21f) to tell me when she's talking with someone else on social media? What the title says.

A couple info:

1. I need to know because it's a trigger for my anxiety, not knowing that she's talking with anyone else, even if there are no malice or it's just her friends. I can't explain why it triggers my anxiety (like full blown cold fingertips and nape, can't breathe), since I trust her anyway. I just want to know. (may be FOMO. I hate the thought of there's a part of her life that I don't know about. But even I'm not sure if it's FOMO. That's anxiety for ya - irrational.)
2. I asked her to promise that to me nicely. She agreed nicely.
3. More than 5 times she's broken her promise. I let it go all the time since she always promises that she won't do it again.
4. Every time I see a comment or a message on her social media that she hasn't told me about, I ask her about it. I try to come out as nice as I can, but she almost always snaps at me, like I'm a burden. Like what I'm asking her is too much. This hurts me even more, on top of the anxiety I already have. Like she doesn't even understand what that does to me.
5. As a courtesy, I tell her too when I'm talking with my friends. I even attach a screenshot so she doesn't worry. Even though she didn't ask for that.

So my question is: AITA for asking for such a simple thing?

1067,"aita for getting angry at roommate? This might be long but it also might be a slight rant so I apologize.

I 19F last April I was taking a course and became friends with two guys, Ethan and Andrew, both 20M. They told me they were studying abroad for 2 weeks and invited me to come along. We talked and exchanged contact and give me flight information, etc. I was very excited for the experience and I was happy that I had a pair of friends to go with.

I am currently on the trip and typing this because I feel absolutely miserable and regret all the time and money I have put into it and I still have a week left. I guess it started when I got on the plane with Ethan and Andrew. While the three of us had the same flight, they sat next to each other and I had to sit elsewhere.

I get to the hotel and discover that my roommate is Eleanor, 21. I didn't have a lot of interaction with Eleanor but she was my TA for a course and she always refused to accept my late work and because of it I did poorly in a class. So I guess I'm pretty biased against liking her.

Eleanor and I get set up in the room and start the orientation of the trip and are going fine. The whole class went out to dinner and I got to sit next to the boys. I try to mention how ""awkward"" it was that they didn't tell me about the seating and how I had to sit in a middle seat next to strangers then Eleanor saids

E: You should have gone online ahead of time and chosen a seat

Me: I would have but neither of them told me where they were sitting

E: They wouldn't have sat with you anyway, I was the third person in their row

Me to boys: well maybe the three of us can sit together when we fly back

E: Sorry, the three of us are staying for a week after the course

I thought Eleanor was lucky to be assigned next to them and she became friends with them since they had 8 hours next to each other on the plane. I let it go and thought the three of us could do something later. So I went to bed but when I woke up, Eleanor appeared to not have slept in the room at all. I assumed she asked to switch rooms and was going to get her stuff later. It is day 4 of the trip and Eleanor has not spent a single night in our hotel room and I only see her when she picks up or drops stuff off. It feels lonely without a roommate.

Yesterday I got to talk to Ethan for a while and he asked to borrow my adapter. Around midnight I was getting ready to go to bed so I went to Ethan and Andrew's room to get my adapter back. When I get there they answer and Ethan hands me my adapter. That's when I see Eleanor on Andrew's bed and I ask why she was there. That really confused me so I had another conversation with her

Me: Eleanor, I don't think it's okay for you to be keeping Ethan and Andrew up, we should go back to our room.

E: I sleep here

Me: No, you are assigned to room XYZ, it's midnight and we have to get up in the morning

I ran into my middle and high school friend a few days before Christmas after not seeing her since we graduated a year and a half ago. Long story short, I did something to her that I thought she would like but she didn’t. I apologized as soon as she voiced her discomfort. She said she was stupid for even putting herself in that position and leading me to do that to her. I tried to make her feel better by saying that it’s 100% my fault. We hugged goodbye and she said there were no hard feelings. I didn’t think that was actually the case so I’ve been feeling deeply guilty.

My wife and I have always wanted biological children. We were both clear about that when we got married. She got pregnant soon after we married, but we lost the pregnancy. We learned that the reason is that she has an issue with her uterus (not getting specific for anonymity reasons). The issue can likely be remedied with surgery. However, any pregnancy post surgery would automatically be classified as ""high risk.""

My wife refuses to get the surgery. She's scared off by the idea of surgery and ""high risk"" pregnancy. I have been putting pressure on her to get the surgery for the last year because I think she owes it to us to at least try, since we got married with the understanding that we wanted biological children.

I matched with this girl (let's call her Jen) on Tinder a few weeks ago. We had been chatting for a while and I thought she was really charming. I decided to invite her for dinner and chose a good restaurant. We met up, exchanged pleasantries and started talking. When we got to ordering though, I noticed she got one of the more expensive seafood dishes and cocktail. I kind of wondered then if she might just be trying to get a free meal out of me. I was the one who did the inviting so I was intending to pay. But I was disappointed because she didn't strike me as that type.

After a while, she orders some dessert and later another cocktail. It set up some red flags again and at some point in the conversation, I brought up what we both do for a living. She told me she was an influencer. Said her page was about travel and wellness. At this point, I got a bit turned off because influencers don't make all that much and they have a reputation of begging for discounts and all that for a shoutout. Seems like I was just there to pay for the food she will post on her page. I kind of checked out of the date and didn't really enjoy.

Finally the bill came and she said she'll pay for her share. I was kind of surprised and offered to pay but she insisted. I started feeling bad about my attitude. I don't think I acted rude towards her, just not too interested. We part and she later texts me that it was a great date but perhaps we weren't compatible. I'm gutted because from our chats we really got along well and shared many interests. I later looked up her profile and she had a solid following. Like 500k+.

1075,"AITA for cancelling a date because of an ""innocent"" question? I've been talking to this guy for a few weeks and we hit it off immediately. We even had a short coffee date during lunch break, and we were on the same vibe. He was funny, charming, similar sense of humor. Everything went great. I should add that we had sex talks as well, discussing kinks and stuff. 

So we decide to have a real date and then he asks if I'm on birth control. I think a few hours and cancel the date. He was confused saying it's just an innocent question, unlike all the stuff we talked about before. And we were both hinting that we will have sex on the first date, so what's wrong about birth control question?

My reasoning is this: if a guy is about to have sex with someone he just met, he MUST be jumping out of his way to use condom. It's a MUST no matter how many times we flirted dirty. And if he even thinks of not using a condom with a girl he just met, that means he was likely to do it before, which means he is at a much higher risk of having an STD and I'm not cool with that. 

I don't trust people who even entertain the idea of having sex with a person they don't know without a condom. I can't risk that even if he ends up using a condom. Doesn't matter that we discussed the sex positions or what we like in bed. I want to feel safe and I don't feel safe even if he thinks of not using a condom on a first date even for a second. 

Hope I explained my reasoning well. Question is - am I the asshole for that line of reasoning? 



Second edit: for people who think that ""safe sex"" means safe for me to not get pregnant, and not safe from STDs as well - fuck off. I want a safe sex for me personally. I rejected a guy who suggested an unsafe sex. Sex on birth control without a condom is an UNSAFE sex.

1083,"AITA for abandoning my boyfriend on a date we had planned for months? I feel incredibly guilty about this, but talking to my friends, they don’t think I’m entirely to blame for how things turned out so I guess I’m here for some unbiased judgement.

My boyfriend (23M) and I (20F) had been planning on going to this little concert for months. My boyfriend bought the tickets for both of us (£40 total) and surprised me with them, excited for us to have this event to go to. The artist performing rarely tours in London so this was also a rare opportunity. I was excited, he was excited. He said he really didn’t want to go alone because the artists songs are mostly romantic so it would be awkward, so I knew I HAD to go with him.

So the concert is at 7pm and we decide to leave his accommodation at 5:30pm so we can have some time to eat dinner beforehand. I was having trouble with both waking and sleeping due to minor jetlag (I had flown in from the US the day before) and so hadn’t managed to eat all day. I felt nauseated and very lightheaded. We even tried to have sex and I had to stop halfway through because I was seeing spots and my ears were ringing. He’s understanding and tells me to drink some water and rest.

I try to sleep until its time for us to leave, hoping that would help, but when I wake up, I feel just as bad. I drink some more water, but everything in me is screaming to get back into bed, so I tell my boyfriend ‘5 more minutes’. He protests, saying we need to get ready to leave. I say ‘15 more minutes, and then I’ll get ready.’ I fall back asleep and wake up 2 hrs later to find his room empty. I assume he’s gone to the concert without me because his ticket is gone, and I feel terrible. I send texts apologizing for ruining the evening and promise to pay him back for the ticket he bought for me and that I’ll make it all up to him. I’m still incredibly lightheaded and hungry but can’t leave his flat because electronic doors + no keys = I’ll get locked out. 

He responded to my messages after the concert to say he was pissed off with me and thought it would be best if I pack my overnight stuff (we don’t live together so, when I stay with him over the weekend, I pack my own overnight bag) and head back home. I asked if I’d get to say goodbye before I left and he said he was going to take a walk so I shouldn’t wait for him.

When I got home, I sent a texts saying I made it back safely and he responded with the same, and that we’d chat tomorrow.

I feel like an asshole for clinging to sleep when we had both been excited for this romantic date and made him go on his own when he didn’t want to. My lightheadedness was due to not eating and we were going out to dinner which would have solved the issue. I wasn’t thinking. I also have a habit of being sedentary so I also ruined the once-in-a-while date where we go out and do an activity that he likes. I think I have full blame here.

My friends think my health should have come first and he shouldn’t have just left me to go to the concert anyway (although I don’t blame him for leaving me because of the explained rarity of this opportunity) and that he shouldn’t have been mad enough to kick me out of his place at 1am.

Am I the (complete) asshole here?

tl:dr; Felt ill so brushed off boyfriend a few hours before a pre-planned date out in order to sleep. Woke up to boyfriend gone and eventually got kicked out of his place cuz he was pissed at me.

EDIT: For those confused, the whole lightheaded/nausea started around 4pm, and the last time I at was 9pm the night before. Also, I realize I shouldn’t have said jetlag to describe my sleep issue. It was more that being up for the 7 hr flight, only getting 2 hrs of sleep, and then sleeping on and off once I settled back in my place messed up my sleep cycle. I don’t know if I SHOULD blame jetlag for my sleep issues.

Also I don’t think I explained myself properly when calling myself sedentary. We have jobs and school during the week so when we hang out on the weekends, its to relax with each other. He likes going to hang with friends sometimes or go on dates, and I prefer just to stay in bed and talk or watch stuff with him. The compromise is going on dates once every other week or once every two weeks so he doesn’t go stir-crazy (haha) and I feel bed for messing this one up. ","**YTA**  


I've flown quite a bit in the past and while I understand jet lag, I just don't really think it's that big of a deal as long as you take proper precautions ahead of time and prepare yourself.

Throwaway because my boyfriend is an avid redditor. I'm just hoping he doesn't browse this subreddit.

My boyfriend loves giving head. I'm not exactly sure why, but he's said before that he enjoys the act of giving (as well as receiving, of course). I'm not one to complain, he's also pretty good at it too. 

However, I hate giving head. I find it disgusting, and he doesn't really ask for it so I had no reason to tell him that before (plus, I felt like telling him I don't like giving head would take the wind out of his sails). 

Recently my boyfriend asked for a blowjob. It wasn't for a special occasion, but he asked nonetheless. I told him no, and gave him my reasons, and he seemed a little bit upset. I asked him if he thought he was owed a blowjob, and he said something to the effect of ""no, nothing like that. Just a little dissapointed is all"". 

Just a few nights ago, we were fooling around, and at the junction where he would normally give me head, he decided not to. I asked him why and he told me he just wasn't feeling it. 

Last night, I asked him why he wouldn't go down on me. To be honest, it kind of felt like he was distant and not as intimate as he normally was. I asked him why he felt so distant, and he shrugged it off. I asked him to continue giving me head in the future, and he seemed annoyed. I'm at a bit of a loss here.

Now my wife always had a deeper relationship with our son than I. But i think this has lead to her enabling his lifestyle. He doesn’t do any sport ( I always tried to push him into doing any but he never like them, he always liked computer and books more ) and eats a lot of junk food.

So the other day I told my wife that we needed to do something about it, that we couldn’t keep enabling him. She suggested that we send him into therapy, saying that he seemed “depressed” and that all this weight problem had started when he had a “confidence problem”. I didn’t New about this confidence problem and apparently my son ask a girl to go with him to a dance and the girl refused him and called him a “ugly nerd”. First I was angry at him for not telling me but I still think this isn’t the reason of his weight, he is as happy as always and except for his eating habits he is acting as always. And even if it was the cause, talking to a therapist wouldn’t burn calories.

This all spired down into a fight with a lot of shouting, and my son hear them. Now neither him nor my wife wants to talk to me. That bad and “unreasonable” I was?

So I was at a Halloween party held by my band, and me and a few friends were screwing around inside, and I stole my friends hit that was part of her costume and ran away with it, and she eventually got it back.

Later we were outside screwing around on the practice field and I went inside for something, and I thought it would be funny to steal her hat again, so I did, but once I ran back outside with it, she didn’t follow. So I waited a bit but then I felt bad so I went back in and have it back to her and she didn’t talk to me for the rest of the night.

1097,"AITA for being harsh about our friends lifechoices? Hello fellow arseholes and judges,

obligatory throwaway because you know.

My husband has a (good) friend (Bob) who recently got divorced by his wife (Lisa). They had problems, lots of arguments, alcohol abuse & her being unhappy here, mainly because she didn't speak the language and had a hard time making friends. So she took their two kids (4 and 6) and left back to her home country to live with her family. She only told him a couple weeks into the ""vacation"" that she doesn't intend to come back. Obviously that's a shitty thing to do and caused a lot of heartache. They got divorced and our friend has been to their country 2 or 3 times in the last year to visit the kids which they absolutely loved. He tells us how much they miss their dad and also how they miss spending time with him, because with his ex-wifes family it's mainly indoor stuff like tv and tablet/phone entertainment and also a pretty unhealthy diet.

As shitty as that situation is, I always kind of thought he can make it work, by either visiting them/having them visit him or even moving back to her country (he's lived there for years) just to make sure he is around his kids and that.

Now onto Bobs lifechoices. One of his colleagues (we'll call Tim) that I hardly know has a wife (Meg) from a relatively poor SEA country, I'm not entirely sure how they met or anything but a while into Bobs and Lisas separation, Meg suggested that Bob should ""get out there again"" and start talking to one of her friends from her country on facebook. That friend we'll call Sari. Bob and Sari started talking a LOT on facebook and in march/april this year he went to visit her in her country for several weeks, spending a huge load of money and paid time off on this visit. He absolutely loved it. When he talks about her, he mainly tells us she's sexy and entertaining and also cooks and cleans very well and that he can imagine her coming here permanently to be his wife. The whole thing has progressed to her coming for a visit soon and Bob apparently thinking about proposing.

My problems with that are for one: Sari has two kids, a teenager and a kid under ten that she would definitely bring over at some point she said and Bob has agreed that would be a wonderful idea and two: Bob works the same job as my husband, so I know very well how much he earns and how much time off he gets and I don't think there's gonna be much resources left to spend on his kids that really miss him. I told my husband that I've lost a good chunk of respect for Bob in all of this and he called me an arse and that Bob is just trying to find some happiness in his life and that I need to respect that. Don't get me wrong, I'm certainly not planning on saying anything, I just feel like he's wasting so much on such an uncertain future instead of trying to keep up with his kids that he already has and that need him that I find it hard to even take him seriously at the moment and would rather not spend a lot of time with him.

So, AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit: I would just like to make it clear, that I've never said anything about any of this to Bob, I'd never meddle in his relationships or the like. I mainly come from a place of concern for him making a big mistake with real consequences. He's not in a great financial position and he knows it. If he marries Sari and has to care for her, her kids and everything involved with that, he won't be able to see his kids anywhere near as often as he did in the last year. He feels a bit lonely and would like someone to share his house with, I get it. But the financial side of this is serious and if he regrets it at some point, he's going to be fucked for alimony forever.",YTA: Why do you think your opinion of their life choices matters?,1,YTA,0.0,0.0,0
1098,"AITA for moving on 'quickly' from my ex-boyfriend who passed 3 weeks ago? My boyfriend of a year passed away 3 weeks ago after a car accident. I was really close with him and his family, and he was close with mine. We were going to live together in the fall next semester. We shared a friend group as he was friends with all of my current friends before me, so they all like him too. 

When I was 16 my best friend passed away due to leukemia and I was really depressed and down for a while and my mom used to constantly tell me to get over it and what's done is done so I'm kind of desensitized to loss and tend to get over it quickly. 


Anyway, after my bf died once of my close friends who I used to like was talking to me and said he was there for me, and I didnt' really need emotional support but we started talking and seeing each other 2 weeks ago. I told my friend about it today and she flipped and two of my other close friends texted me and said what I was doing was fucked up and it's too soon.

I know she has because mutual friends have told me. And I'm happy for her! I've also been on a couple of dates with a couple of people, just testing the waters after a long term relationship.

Anyway, before we broke up we bought tickets for a festival to see some of our favourite bands all in one place. Before we even went I asked her to try and not message her new guy around me, and I'll do the same. It just didn't seem fair on the other person having to see that. 

We get on the train and immediately she starts going on her phone, So I try not to pay too much attention to it. Then when going onto the underground I can clearly see she's messaging someone else, which we agreed we wouldn't do. The day goes on, and every 10 minutes when I look over to her or try and make conversation, she's messaging this guy. It starts to upset me because I thought she would've had more respect for me than that. 

On the train home I decide to tell her how much this upset me. I told her that I haven't been texting someone because I didn't want her to be upset, and I hoped she would have done the same. Her response was ""I don't owe you anything anymore. I have no obligations to you and you can't tell me what to do"". 

This really pissed me off and I spent the rest of the train journey in pretty much silence until she said ""I'm getting off at the next stop"". I asked why, and it's because she was off to see her new guy. She had been messaging him all day, and then went back to his place infront of me.

But when I got home I started thinking about what she said, and thought that I could be the ass hole in this situation for asking her not to text someone else in front of me. AITA for asking her to not message someone in front of me, even though we're no longer together?

I tell my bf to sort it out and he takes the dog out of the living room. Everythings fine for a while. Then somehow the dog finds his way back in and tries to get on to the  bottom of the couch. 
I can feel his fur tickle my feet and get a bit frustrated (since he's ruining the mood) and lightly kick him off.

The dog falls off (but quickly gets up and is fine) and makes a ""whimper or sqeul""? My bf stops kissing, turns around and sees the dog and then asks me ""What did you do"". I tell him that I just gently kicked the dog off.

I've always loved dogs and always had dogs, and my dog that I have now is my best bud. I love how social they are and how much they show love back to their humans, and that they are smart and trainable.

I definitely do not like cats. Lots of people love them and that's fine. But I personally do not even slightly see the appeal of taking care of an animal that doesn't give two shits if you live or die, and that takes an insane amount of training and effort to learn even basic commands...which they will only ever do if they feel like it. I can't count how many times I've been scratched or bitten by a cat for no other reason than I dared to go near it. So yeah. Not a fan.

My girlfriend and I have been dating for coming up on one year and she is a one in a million girl. When we're apart I often find myself just wanting to spend time together, she is wickedly funny and always making me laugh out loud, and an amazing artist. And, she has a cat.

It is not a particularly bad cat or anything, as far as cats go. Very average. But I am so the opposite of a cat person that even average is bad. Have you ever hated someone so much that every little thing annoys you? That's what cats are like to me, and this cat is just everywhere when I am hanging out at my girlfriend's apartment. Jumping up and down from shelves, stepping on my crotch, kneading my leg with its paws and most importantly *claws*, yowling outside the bedroom door whenever I spend the night. My girlfriend of course loves him and doesn't see any flaws.

All of this wouldn't be a problem, but as I said we are approaching one year and I have been thinking about our future together. I can see myself marrying this girl, and I want her to move in with me. But I do not want to have a cat. I don't even know if my dog will get along with it, and I *know* I won't get along with it.

There have been incidents before where she urged me to ride her to the ER at night because she wasn't feeling good, had some issues etc.

Most of the times though it was nothing to worry about,she could leave after a quick examination.
The doctors give us a lecture in a roundabout way to not come to the ER at night if it can wait till tomorrow (not USA btw, we have public health care)

Wait till tomorrow you have your appointment anyway with our own doctor"". She got kinda irritated and angrily told me it's fine,she'll ride the car herself.

My mom was kinda confused at this point and tried showing the doctor that her own machine showed a much higher and more dangerous value. 

Turns out the unit on my mom's device was a total different one than the regular ones, so she read the numbers totally wrong and assumed they were worse.
Dr. just told us to get a new machine and call a non emergency hotline first next time.

So we leave and my mom seems a little embarrassed, because she starts trying to explain how it was before and she did in fact feel bad. I tell her it's okay since I only want to get back to my bed at this point. 

At home I want to remind her to make sure she differentiates between serious emergencies and regular ""I'm sick and not feeling good"" occasions. Because I do love my mom more than anything and I get worried just like this time. But because it happens more often I'm scared that I won't take her seriously if something worse might happen another time. Also to not burden hospital staff.

She got really upset and explained she did feel bad. I only told her she could have waited until the next morning, since there is a safe appointment anyway.

I'm constantly trying to improve and I'll admit, I haven't made the best strides, they're still not all that good and drawing actual poses take a lot out of me, so I'm sticking with headshots and practicing other stuff only occasionally. 

It gets discouraging sometimes with how I can't seem to improve no matter what I do, and because of that I've been in a funk for two months or so and haven't touched any of my sketch pads. Well, until last night. I was watching anime last night and got the sudden itch to draw again so a few ripped and crumbled up papers later, I finally got something I was happy with.

My younger brother (12) got home from school earlier and I was super excited to show him. He made a face and flat out said he didn't like it. That's all he said. So I asked why and he told me that the eyes are too far apart, the mouth of my character looks like its on her chin and a few other things. Personally I think those things look alright, they fit with my art style, but I definitely do see other flaws no doubt about it. Like I said, I'm not very good yet.

He doesn't think I'm any good and it's a waste of time. 

A good friend of his also draws and she's pretty damn good. I've heard him encourage her before and tell her that she should keep it up. He's compared me to her too which also really stings at times. 

Honestly, I should have known that he'd say that. He's pretty blunt and I think I knew that he thought that from the beginning. I shouldn't have got in my feelings and then asked for an honest opinion. 

So I'm really upset and haven't spoken a word to him since that conversation. He thinks I'm the asshole for the same reason I said, I shouldn't have asked if I didn't want honesty, and that I'm older so I should be more mature about this. I agree, but also think I have a right to be upset.

So I told my grandma she could sleep in 2nd sisters room as it downstairs. But now 2nd sister refuses to clean her room so grandma can stay in there.

So now my grandma is upset she has no where to stay and has said she will go upstairs and use a bucket at night if she needs. Now when i was told this I was furious that my 2nd sister is willing for my grandma to do this. I argued with my mother again as I've been told I'm not allowed to talk to 2nd sister about this directly. And my mum has come up with the idea to put me and my 1st sister in the same room and my mum and dad sleep in my 1st sisters room. and my grandma sleeps in my parents room.

Other note, her thumb print is on my phone, I know her password, we’re very open about our texts and messages and such and show each other everything. 

So girlfriend and I just had an amazing weekend getaway. Last night after we got home, I went to my place and she went to hers. We were supposed to just watch Netflix and go to bed since we were both tired. She texts me that her two guy friends are at a nearby bar and want to get drinks with us. I was tired and not feeling the best but I agreed, I didn’t want to be a downer. So I go over and have a drink and call us an Uber to the bar. We meet them and it ends up being really fun. I joke around with them a lot, we all have a good time, and I was feeling really positive about the whole situation, and proud of myself for being able to just hang out without my normal invasive negative thoughts. 

Near the end of the night, we were talking about how they wanted to get fast food. Then we said our goodbyes and my girlfriend and I Ubered home. At home, the two guys start texting her in a group chat about going through a drive thru etc and, still feeling good about everything (and being a bit tipsy) I was texting them back from her phone. They were addressing me by name, we were joking around about walking through the drive thru, I typed out a funny text and let her see it then deleted it, etc - all in good fun I thought. Then she gets standoffish and says to just put on Netflix, so I do. But I can tell she’s really upset. They keep texting back and she keeps deleting the notifications and getting mad when I ask what they were saying - again, I thought we were all involved and it was all good. 

Turns out she was pissed. She thought I was reading through her texts, she said I was invading her privacy. I did not look at anything except for the texts that I thought were meant for both of us (it’s not the first time they’ve said stuff to me through her group chat). She said the texts had nothing to do with me (even though they were addressing me by name), and said that if they wanted me involved at all then I would’ve been being texted too (they don’t have my number as we are all new friends).

So theres this girl (lets call her Alex) I'm really interested in and we've been slowly getting close. She's a very quiet, timid girl who's not really massive on socialising, which comes imporant. 

Tonight for halloween I invited her over to my place to watch some horror films and do some drinking games w some close friends.

At least that was the plan.

We agreed on 9.30, but due to reasons she had to come late at around 10.30, which was totally fine to me. So before she came, some other friends (who she did not know) came over and we smoked some js together.

Being all high together, I couldnt make them leave and decided to just invite them over to join the film viewing. They all agreed. When Alex came by at 10.30, she was all smiling and really happy. I told her some people came over and she said yeah cool that'll be fun.

When she came in my apartment and saw like 10-12 other strangers, her face immediately turned sour. She just stayed silent the whole night and was very clearly annoyed/upset. The movie everyone picked also turned out to be one that she's watched before too, and she was just on her phone like the whole time.

After the film ended and people were leaving, I tried walking her home and she just curtly replied that its fine, she can go alone. So I walked her to the door of my building and tried to go in for a goodbye hug, but she didnt even look back once and just left with her back towards me.

Except there was a conversation above about how he appreciated that she showed him nude pictures of herself (in person), and she was like ""No problem, I'm an open book"". This was while we were in a relationship.


Obviously I was upset by this so I confronted her. She didn't say anything and just looked like a deer in the headlights she began to cry and I stormed out and drove home.

I decided to message friends and group chats to tell them the news. In one group chat I said something like ""Welp, now that that relationship is over.. anybody want nudes?"", ""I'll sell them for a dollar"" and shit like that. (This is the AITA part).
I wasn't actually going to do it. It was just a heat of the moment joke.


The main reason I felt this was acceptable was because I wanted to make it bite her in the ass for being so ""open"". Kinda like a ""How do you like it now?"" type of thing. I didn't end up showing anybody any nudes.


This was a *massive* group chat with a bunch of people from our high school and a girl who isn't friends with either of us reached out to my ex and told her what I said. This girl was on my ex's side and turned a bunch of people against me. They even emailed my mom telling her what I said.

I am the youngest out of three. I am more of an introvert, but I have dated around a fair bit since my teen years, but have been with my my current partner now almost 5 years.

My sister is older than me by about 7 years. She is an extrovert and social butterfly. Very obviously our parents' favorite and got spoiled a lot. She's not a brat, but has always had really high standards for everything in her life. This includes guys, so basically she's only ever dated one guy for like, 4 years, but they broke up 3 years ago. She's still friends with her ex though.

My brother is older than me by about 10 years and has very functional autism. He's capable of understanding and picking up on other's thoughts/emotions through their words and actions, but he struggles some and he worries about it. It gives him a lot of anxiety and he has no idea what to do when he thinks people are upset. He struggles also to express how he is feeling. He seemed perfectly content on being alone, but just under two weeks ago introduced his first ever girlfriend to the family. I haven't met her face-to-face yet, but if she makes my brother happy, I am sure she's awesome.

Since my brother told everyone about his new girlfriend, my sister's been posting a lot on social media about being single, having been dumped in the past, etc. It is so much to the point where my partner is asking if my sister is okay.

I get that my sister is probably going through something right now. She's now the single one out of the three of us. I wouldn't be surprised if people were now asking her when she was going to find someone. It was always presumed that my sister would be the first of us to get married/have kids.

Now, one thing that may be worth mentioning is that my son has Asperger's. And for this, all that means is that it's very easy to tell when he doesn't like something because it's very easy to tell when he does. When he likes it, he is very noticeably excited and extremely grateful. When he doesn't, he's calm and mostly indifferent-though very polite.

He didn't like the joke box, I knew immediately despite the fact he said thank you and accepted it. So I acknowledged that he didn't like it, and apologized for getting him a gift he didn't enjoy. He responded by assuring me he did like it and thanking me again, because, like I said, he's polite. Later my youngest told me she never liked that I did that, and when I pressed she said it was unpleasant when I acknowledged a gift was unwanted.

1148,"AITA for refusing to help my wife rescue a chicken that I didn't want in the first place? Background

My in-laws and myself occasionally hatch and raise our own chickens. Part of the process is killing most of the Roosters once they hit puberty and get too aggressive towards each other & the hens. The killing is an unpleasant job but we do it as humanely as possible and try to give them a great life before the time comes.

(I’m sure many will say YTA for killing chickens, but I’ve thought long and hard about the ethics, and I’m comfortable with where the process sits compared to buying meat and eggs.

About 3-4 years ago, my wife bought home a scrawny looking blind chicken. Turns out my wife’s co-worker had been telling my wife about how one of her chickens was blind, and being ruthlessly bullied (chickens are jerks to each other), she said she wanted to put the chicken out of her misery but couldn’t bring herself to do it; my wife responded with “ChickenFightTA will kill her for you.” 

At the time I was annoyed; my wife hadn’t consulted me before offering my murdering services, and even though it’s part of a process that I’m very comfortable with – killing chickens is a really unpleasant task.  

When then the chicken arrived my FIL placed the blind chicken under his protection and made a fuss about me euthanizing it. I was again annoyed because we now had to care for a chicken that needed to be kept separated from the others (nearly doubling the daily effort required to keep chickens. 

I said that I didn’t want to keep the chicken and that I won’t participate in its daily upkeep. This was agreed to by all involved.  

Since then my FIL has sadly passed away. His protection of the blind chook is still being honoured. 

Over the last two days we have had very heavy rain. My MIL (who lives with us) pointed out that the blind chicken’s run was sitting in a giant puddle. She asked my wife to move the chicken to higher ground. 

Because it was bucketing down rain, my wife asked if I would help her. I refused. I had just got out of the shower after a 15 hour shift at work, and didn’t want to get soaking wet. 

My wife moved the chicken by herself whilst I had a coffee and read a book. My wife now firmly considers me TA. 

Extra information: 

\- Moving the chicken can be done by one person, it just takes longer. My refusal resulted in my wife spending 15 mins in the pouring rain rather than 5 mins. 

TLDR: 

Without consultation, my wife bought home a chicken with a disability. It was agreed that I wouldn’t have to lift a finger to care for this chicken. Today I refused to help move the chicken’s home out of a giant puddle, causing my wife to spend an extra 10 minutes in the pouring rain.

I know she is a virgin and has never used any drugs. 2 months in she tells me he smoked marijuana and has used hallucinogens such as LSD in the past. This obviously made me very uncomfortable, but as long as he isn't using any longer it's fine. But I dont entirely trust him.

They were spending too much time together. Every weekend either he was here or she at his. Often seeing each other in the in the middle of the week after school. She is in her final year before med school, I can see school work has lost its priority in her life. He is all she ever wants to talk about. I have never seen her like this. 

I decided to step in, I got his number off her phone and asked him if he could stop seeing my daughter during the week. He agreed. 

Two weeks later they spend the entire Monday afternoon together. He dropped her off and I immediately called him and asked him to pull over at the corner. I drove up to him. I tell him again that he needs to start seeing my daughter less. Not during the week, not every day on the weekends. I can see he was really nervous. I asked when last he used any drugs and he looks at me wide eyed (dont think he knew that I knew). He says he smoked marijuana within the last month. Now I'm pissed off. I dont want that stuff near my daughter. I started questioning him more, asked if he has slept with her, what other drugs he has done etc. He claims they havnt and marijuana is all he has used in the last year. But I really dont trust him. I asked him to keep our conversation just between us. I needed to figure out what to do. 

The next day my daughter confronts me, crying, screaming, asking me how I could go behind her back. I told her I cant allow her to see him again, that I know her better than anyone and he is bad for her. He is distracting her, he is a bad influence and I will never trust him. After hours of fighting she agreed with me. She broke up with him. 

4 weeks later i caught her meeting him behind my back at a shopping center near us. I told her it has to end. He is wrong for her. I know she can do better than him. I had her phone disconnected so they couldn't contact one another, I started dropping and collecting her from school to make sure she isn't seeing him in between. 

I know I have taken things a bit far and going behind my daughters back was questionable, but she just doesn't get it. AITA or am I justified for not wanting my daughter to be with a drug user?","This has got to be a Shitpost.

1153,"AITA for not paying for a damage of a plastic panel Sorry for long post and no to:dr as there’s too much context 

So basically me and this guy hate each other because of a lot of things. However, we are passive aggressive till recently. During the incident, he said my Co curriculum activity was shit, and I replied that if they produce someone like you then they are also bad. Before that we had an oral test in front of class. He gave a thumbs down which I interpreted him as being salty as he didn’t do very well. Going back to my reply, then he said some profanities while I continued saying that is this what your parents taught you? Using parents as a tool to provoke him without swearing while he was screaming profanities profusely. Then there was this other guy who were friends with both of us and witnessed everything above, I whispered to him that he is probably salty about the test shit. Then he was so angry he took my water bottle and threw it against the plastic panel which broke (but not my water bottle) 

After that we had a talk with our teachers which resulted in us being friends again but then because I was held back for this even though I didn’t damage any property, my mother came down and had a talk with my form tutor. Finally it ended with her saying she wanted an email from the teacher following this incident  or if possible a phone call from the guys parents (he was known for having a horrible temper last year, being violent after provoked the slightest, it isn’t so bad now) however till now she hasn’t emailed at all.

The next day the teacher asked him to pay $60 but never message me to pay $30 which was half of the cost. We agreed to pay 50% each during The talk. Then my mother doesn’t give me the money because she needed the email to say like whatever. Throughout the teacher didn’t message me or email me about the cost at all, only messaging the other guy.  Now we are no longer friends because he shouted I need to change my bad habit which was discussed during our talk . I felt he was hypocritical as he was over exaggerating, another thing we talked about.

Now my friend is blaming me because I’m not paying for the window as the guy only paid half . I explained to him that it was because my mom didn’t allow and that there could be something else we didn’t know about and that’s the reason why the teacher didn’t say that I needed to pay. He said he wanted to go ask on my behalf but I told him not to because there could be a reason. Then now he’s angry and is giving me the cold shoulder. I feel that although it concerns you as it results in poor air flow, it is none of your business not to do anything at all about this. Another friend was also with him but after that he was okay and didn’t care much . That is the type of personality I respect as although he may feel I should have paid, he didn’t really care and continued to be friends. (Note that all the friends are different people) so am I the asshole for not paying for it ?

","If you agreed during the talk with your teacher to pay for 50% then you should pay that money, no matter what your mum says later. 

Trying to go back on that agreement is an asshole move, you should allow him to at least approach the teacher to ask why they acted differently to your expectations after the talk.",1,YTA,0.0,0.0,1

I (21 M) moved back with my family (mom, 42 and 6 yo brother) from a larger city because of better job opportunities (my mom was very happy with it). Yes, i drink, a lot, just because:
1) i am very tolerant to alcohol, it takes me a bottle of vodka to be just talky and act funny
2) i like the feeling of calming down and  I read a lot, so alcohol for me personally, makes reading even more pleasing because of my OCD
3) i have never acted weird because of drinking, i am in general very patient and calm person and avoid any conflict possible. If two drunk dudes are in a fight, i am the one who makes them hug each other 10 mins later. All i do when i am even really drunk is reading / doing work for my job / just sleeping if i suddenly get hella drunk

I pay for my part of an apartment, because i own 1/3 of it (just my room), cook my own food, but every day i have to put on earphones and just ignore my mum screaming and waving her arms impatinately for “awful smell in our apartment”. I leave my room about 4 times a day, and never had such remarks from people or romantic partners with whom i’ve lived with, i dont even mention the reaction. She just stands and screams for 10-20 mins even tho i just dont look and react, then leaves, screams to herself how is she done with me and calling me names for amount of time, and then comes back. Over and over.

Today she came to my room and said that i MUST move out and if i don’t, she’ll call the cops.

I get that i drink a lot, but no bad words, no bad actions were given by me to anybody because of that. 
But the shame she puts in me having this habit is making me think that i am mad and this is inappropriate from my side. The fact that each one of our siblings dont drink (no, not religious at all, not even close, just don’t like it) and that she always is making up that i am drunk af every day (which i am absolutely not bc if i am i stay at my frends/bf place to not make her more upset than she already is) does make it worse, cause everyone thinks i am pure evil and disgusting.

1160,"AITA for suggesting a family vacation without my step-son? There's so much going on with this that I'm not sure I'll be able to give all the info with the character limit, but I'll do my best. I'm at work stressed the fuck out over this and could use outside opinions. 

I met the woman I'm in a relationship with around 4 years ago. Her son was 9 at the time. Going on 14 now. His father is still.in his life and gets him every other weekend. Week days and school nights he's with us. We started living with each other after a couple of years.

Learning how to be a step parent has been the most challenging thing in life. I've tried to do everything to the best of my abilities. I've shown interest in his hobbies, I treat him the same as I would my own (besides discipline - even in my own house, I feel funny about coming down hard on a kid who isn't my son) 

He just isn't warming up to me. It's starting to feel like the question is shifting from ""when will he accept me in his life"" to ""will he ever accept me"" 

I get it too. I sympathize with him and feel really bad for his situation. Having a broken home was my biggest fear growing up and I can't imagine what it's like to have your parents break up. 

Me and his mom also had a baby last year, which obviously did not help anything. He acts like his step sister is a burden and doesn't belong in the same home as him. 

He's so aggressive towards the idea of me. The mom and I bought a bunch of board games, as were tried to start a weekly family night. For him on the 3rd week of it to refuse and claim ""how can it be family night if he isn't my family"" - that stung, as much as I pretend it doesn't it's hard to provide for and give somebody everything they want to be met back with disdain, disgust, and complete passive aggressiveness. If he walks by me and his mom kissing or embracing, even holding hands he'll roll his eyes or make a disapproving grunt.

It's blowing up a bit and getting worse before it's getting better. We don't know if the dad is telling him bad things about me, or coaching his son to act up with me, but it's getting horrible. 

I'm the manager of a pretty good sized distribution center. Very stressful, demanding job. Long hours at the job but all for my family to have a good life. I have 120 vaca hours every year and this year took the entire week off next week for Christmas. I really need the time to relax and unwind. 

Here's my dilemma. I want to take a vacation for the week without the son. I want to get to enjoy it. I don't want the vacation filled with passive aggressiveness or fights over stupid shit because he has a bad attitude about our relationship 4 yeats later. He would act ungrateful and like he wouldn't want to be there anyway. So thinking that wasn't unreasonable I broached this subject to my girlfriend. Asked if she could ask his father to watch him for the week so we could go on vacation. She didn't react well to that honestly, and is pissed at me for suggesting it. AITA?","He is a CHILD.

1162,"AITA for insisting my girlfriend does not get a nose job? My [19M] girlfriend [30F] is super self-conscious about her appearance. She's one of those people who will insist she's ugly and deny any compliments you try to give her. 

One of the areas of her body she's most insecure about is her nose. She really seems to hate the shape of it and even goes so far as to sometimes try to hide it when we're together.

Personally, I actually think her nose is really cute. I genuinely really like it. Of course, as stated above, she will deny any of these compliments as misguided at best or lies at worst.

Multiple times, she has expressed interest in getting a nose job in the future when she is in a better situation financially, to which I have always vehemently responded no. Obviously I like her nose as is, but I'm also personally against plastic-surgery in general. Unless you have some sort of accident that alters your appearance, I am morally against plastic surgery. I think everyone should learn to love themselves for who they are, and that simply paying to undo it usually turns out worse aesthetically, prevents emotional growth, and is essentially cheating. Not to mention the associated risks, relatively small though they may be (but not as small as a lot of people seem to think).

I don't think my girlfriend thinks I'm an asshole for this, but sometimes I wonder if I am. I mean, I know it's not my choice to make, obviously. Ultimately it's her decision. But sometimes I think that a nose job is a stupid waste of money, a cop out and preventer of emotional growth, and ultimately a bad thing overall, while other times I think maybe I'm being a bit too harsh and, if it would make her happy and feel even the slightest bit more comfortable... it would be a good thing? Still unnecessary and a waste of money, but perhaps something I shouldn't so vehemently refuse? Honestly, knowing her, I DON'T think it would make her happier, I think she'd just find a new thing about herself to hate, but I don't know that for certain.

So... AITA?

EDIT: To clarify, it's not like I'm saying she's not *allowed* to get a nose job, or that I'd leave her if she did, or anything like that, I'm just trying to dissuade her from it. I'm willing to accept that still makes me TA, but I've seen some comments about me trying to ""own"" her, or say what she's allowed to do with her body.

1166,"AITA for wanting to date my ex's and my Friend So I (30M) and my ex (30F) who dated for five years have been broken up on and off the past two years and officially done for eight months. We moved to a city together when we first started dating and have a lot of the same friends. 

The reason I bring this up is that a few years back we tried to open up our relationship and one weekend during that time while my ex was out of town, I ended up hanging out with one of the women (35F) in our friend group for an entire weekend while my ex was gone. Nothing sexual happened but I did spend the entire weekend at her house. Things didn't go over well with my ex (I told her immediately when she got home) and at the time caused some turmoil in our relationship which we were able to overcome.

There was also tension between my ex and this woman, but quickly the two of them became closer than they ever had been before. It should be noted that my ex had hooked up with a random guy while I was out of town previous to this while she was out with a few friends so most everyone knew about this open relationship thing.

Fast forward to about a year ago and I was out with some friends and ran into the same woman. We hung out and I spent the night and the following night at her place (nothing sexual happened again) and that was that. We both get along well but she told me she cared about my ex and didn't want to hurt the relationship since they are closer and better friends now. I was respectful of this and that was that between us other than seeing each other at various get-togethers.

Fast forward to about a month ago and we find ourselves together at a bar and hit it off quite well as we do except this time she texts me after she leaves. Since that night we have been hanging out together (No sex still at this point) and things are going well. She has mentioned that she really likes hanging out with me but still has the same apprehension. I understand where she is coming from and this is the reason why we haven't had sex or started exploring this relationship more. I really want to be respectful but I am kind of letting things happen and not fully supporting letting this thing go since I like this person.

I don't want to compromise my ex and this womans relationship but part of me feels like my ex is somehow controlling this in some capacity. The reason I say this is the first time after we spent that weekend together I was getting the vibe that my ex put herself more in this womans life to check that nothing was going on between us and is still doing that. I don't view my ex in a bad light and I still love her very much as a person and I know she feels the same about me but my ex wanted our relationship to end. I feel like I would have some sort of regret if I just let this all go and didn't pursue this to some degree.

I said like that kid reading the book as I pointed at Jules. My friend started to tell me not to call Jules out like that. I was confused about that because I wanted to be their friend and they were technically called a loner. They kept telling me not to call people out like that because it's mean.

My friend looked around and counted the number of loners in our school. They asked me if I really wanted to go through my idea. I restated my question from earlier and they kept telling me that I sounded serious everytime I asked.

1171,"AITA for protesting a druggies funeral? So, I have always been religious but I was very religious when I was younger. There was a sort of fundamentalist style sect that I chose to be part of (my wider family isn't religious) that sometimes did demonstrations (sort of a bit like West Boro Baptist Church). Anyway, a high school girl had recently done a drugs overdose (turns out later she was a victim of a forced sex, a gangbang I heard in the rumours later and this had driven her to overdose).

I was furious at the drug use of people around my age and we protested in the area around her funeral (the sheer waste etc.etc.) and decried drug use (what we really wanted was the authorities to clamp down on miscreant kids) .

Even though I was only high school age I was a big guy and kept the other members of my sect safe (they jokingly called me the enforcer).  I wanted no violence but unfortunately, some of the kids in the area got in the face of one of my Church members (I understand they were emotional but there was no need for aggression), so I grabbed the kid and bodyslammed him (I think I might have damaged one of his ribs but I didn't mean to).

It didn't end there sadly. I noticed a nasty looking girl was trying to get behind me (probably to cheap shot me), so I threw her to the floor by her hair as well and she cut her lip. 

The thing is that all I knew was that I was being attacked and needed to defend myself and my Church fellows.

People were moving on from the funeral by then and so it the tension de-escalated. The whole situation was very regrettable (there was no need for violence it should have remained civil). I think our protest was dignified but I wasn't aware that the drug victim in question had been driven to suicide by forced sex.

1175,"AITA for organizing a date with a girl before breaking up with EX So basically I had been seeing this girl (let’s call her F)  for a couple of months and honestly I never had strong feelings for her but she was nice we got along and I wanted to give her a chance to see if things could work. 
At the start of December I met this other girl (let’s call her S) through a mutual friend and we quickly became friends and I started to develop feelings for her. 
Now I live only 10-15 minutes walk away from S. (Is relevant for later). I realized that I basically had far stronger feelings for S then I did for F. This was around the 20th of December. With it being so close to Christmas and the new year I put off breaking up with F until after the holidays. 
 I only saw F maybe once a week and was trying to get myself ready to break up and was building a distance to make it a little less shocking and maybe easier on myself. Honestly I’m not good at break ups, so I’m sure I’ve done something wrong there. 
Now around early-mid January I had only seen F once and hadn’t managed to break up because like I said I’m not good at it and just didn’t manage it. This was my mistake I know. 
Then my mom got sick. There was a couple of weeks where I wasn’t sure that my mom wouldn’t make it. Also I live a 20 hour flight away from my parents and going to see them would not be cheap or easy. So basically there was no point in me going back when it wouldn’t help. I felt pretty awful about this and said as much to F who was super nice and understanding. But having already decided to break up with her I didn’t want to lean on her to much during this because she was also busy with work and such. However we didn’t really see each other much over these few weeks so again we didn’t break up. 1) because I just didn’t feel up to it and 2) because I felt she deserved to see me in person rather then doing it over the phone.

Then There is S. We had become fast friends and I had feelings for her. Basically she was free a lot while I was worried about my mom and because we lived so close we ended up spending a lot of our time together just hanging out. Nothing romantic about it just as friends because she lived so close and I wasn’t enjoying being alone with my thoughts. However honestly I did fall for S even harder during this time period.
About a week after I knew my mom was gonna be fine I found a chance to agree to meet F on a day she was free and planned to break up with her then. 

The night before I was up late talking to S and telling her what I had planned for the next day. Shortly after she told me she had feelings for me I told her the same and after talking for a bit we agreed that we both wanted to give it a chance so agreed that next weekend we would meet and try going on a date. 
Overall I feel bad for agreeing that date the night before breaking up with F but does that make me an asshole?

1176,"AITA for excluding & not accommodating my vegan & vegetarian friends from my dinner parties, even after being confronted? Thanks to YouTube (and probably age), I've developed a passion for cooking. Long gone are the days of frozen pizza bagels & ramen noodles, I'm at the point where I can make beef tartare & escargot that rivals the bistros of Paris!

I'm also lucky to share a lovely adult apartment with my wife, which happens to be spacious enough to a host an 8 person dinner. When I'm cooking for guests, it's always a meat based meal. I'm really into all things meaty BBQ, steaks, duck, roasts, lamb chops, shanks you name it! During the week, I stay meat free, but when the weekend hits, and I have guests over, you know I'm hitting the butcher shop.

Here's the problem, obviously not everyone I rendezvous with is a meat eater, I would say 30% are either animal free or vegan. Knowing this, and having no desire to host a vegan or vegetarian dinner party, they just never get invited. These dinners have been a regular thing at my residence for the last 2 years.

&#x200B;

Over the last few months, a few of my plant based friends have confronted me as to why they never get invited over for dinner. I explain that I exclusively cook meat dishes, that I'm not really interested in hosting something otherwise, and whatever we carry on. I'm still dining with these ppl at restaurants. I have hosted a handful of vegetarian nights, (cheese fondue, mac&cheese, etc) but never anything 100% vegan

For one couple we're close with, two vegans, that answer wasn't good enough. They accused me of not liking them and making a deliberate effect to exclude them, as I'd invite a bunch of our mutual friends over, yet not them - and I should be accommodating to their diet. I said it's their choice to be vegans, and that I don't even really know any solid vegan recipes. Anyway now they think I'm an asshole and not a good friend.

It get even more complicated with friends who's significant other is vegan, I'll extend the invite to one of them?

AITA for not being accommodating?",INFO - Could you not just have them over for their company and make them a simple salad or even have them bring their own food and still have a meat centered main for the rest of the guests? Does seem like you could be excluding them intentionally.,1,YTA,0.0,1.0,0

The coffee shop I go to is close to a police station so this happens 5 or 6 times a year at least.

However, I've had a fat fetish ever since I hit puberty and have always wanted to gain weight.  After years of repressing my sexuality, I finally took the plunge about 3.5 years ago, and I'm now 185 pounds.  I'm happy with my weight and feel like I've hit that sweet spot where I'm on the upper end of chubby but not quite fat yet.  I feel sexy and satisfied with my body for the first time in my life.

My boyfriend hates that I've gained weight and is directly threatening to break up with me over it.  He says that it's not fair that he's about the same weight as when we started dating but I've gained 75 pounds.  He calls me disgusting and says that often he doesn't even want to look at me, let alone touch me (which hurts so much).  But I think he's overreacting.  This is my body and my choice, and it's not like I'm morbidly obese.  I've told him that I'm content with my current weight and don't want to gain any more, so he doesn't have to worry about that, and I feel like we should be able to compromise (I honestly would prefer him a bit heavier, but I've never pressured him to change himself for me because it's his body and his choice) and work this out.  People's bodies change all the time.  If everyone freaked out over a little weight gain, then marriages would never last into old age.

He is refusing to budge and has told me that I either lose the weight or he's breaking up with me.  He's given me a month to decide, but I don't know what to do because I love him and don't want to lose him and everything that's great about our relationship.

She asked me to call her out.  I said no; she is an adult and if she wants to skip school, she can face the consequences for it.  I asked her what would happen.  She said just detention.  I asked her if she could still exempt all her finals.  She said yes (with an eye roll) and stomped off.

Friday came and she was home.  I have her the choice to be driven to school by me.  She declined.  I again reminded her about finals and she once again stomped off.

I got a message from her today.  Not only does she get a detention, she can't exempt any finals.

1181,"AITA for wanting to cut all contact with my immediate family after I move? So six months ago I got into a new relationship with a really good friend of mine. We've been so happy together ever since. But while that was happening, my family decided that they needed to set some ""rules."" 

(For context, I am 20 and I'm living with my mom and brother. And I had previously told my mom about my struggles with depression.)

My mom started by telling me that he can't come over when she's not at the house. Which was never an issue beforehand, as both my brother and I have had company over in the past. 
My youngest brother had no problem with my relationship with my boyfriend, until he figured out that we were dating. This ended up making my brother act very hostile towards him and not want to be around us in any way, shape, or form. 
Knowing my mom, she always takes my little brother's side on everything. So when she learned that he was ""very uncomfortable"" with having him over, she told me that my boyfriend wasn't able to come over to our house anymore. This made me feel like my happiness and opinions on the matter weren't being taken into account at all. 
So, being the combative person that I am, I decided to speak my mind and bring my dad into the equation. I'm so glad that I was able to do this as he had no issue with my relationship, but instead he encouraged it in every way.
He was able to be somewhat of a mediator in this situation, and he was able to make my Mom see things from my side. My brother, on the other hand, wasn't persuaded by his words and has continued to hold a grudge on my boyfriend. 
My mom started making comments about our relationship that worsened my mental state at the time. I became more depressed and started to feel like I wasn't being loved or cared for anymore. She even started ignoring me at one point. 
I began cutting again, shortly after this, and my boyfriend started to notice my state. He wasn't able to get many details out of me, so he ended up talking to my dad about it. Once he learned the severity of it all, he decided to offer his opinion on it. 
He voiced how I must be feeling about all of this and how he also felt that my mental state was worsening because of it. He explained how my brother's grudge against him was all because he wasn't able to handle the fact that I'm dating someone. My dad then took it one step further and talked to my mother to get her to stop making those side comments and encourage her to get over it and accept that I'm happy. 
Months later, I'm still uncomfortable being in this house with them, but their sourness has subsided since then. I was able to find a place with my boyfriend that's farther away from this place and I hope to be moving out in the next week or so. 
So what I'm asking is if I should cut them off entirely as a result of the situation, or if I should put up with them and risk possibility of them making more side comments and worsening my state.","No judgment, as this isn’t something that belongs here. It needs to go to r/relationships.

He was back in the states while the rest of us were working in Papua New Guinea for the past 6 months.

1207,"WIBTA for crushing a writer's doomed dream? First time post, sorry if it's in the wrong place. I'm (30f) a writer, working on a series. I'm not top of my game by any means but I have a decent grasp of writing. I have an agent, publishing deal and a good understanding of what it takes to get published. I know the difference between a good MS and a bad one. 

I have a writing community friend (33f) who is really sweet and kind. We met through a LotR fansite as we made both huge fans. My friend lives with her sister and is kind of a loner, she's also prone to depression. 

On the back of a LotR fanfic she wrote about nine years ago, she has altered and CTRL H'd the story into something resembling an original novel. It is not an original novel, but enough details have been changed to (perhaps) prevent a lawsuit. Its also not well written and offers absolutely nothing in the way of narrative. To be frank, it's terrible. 

Over the last two years I have repeatedly tried telling her that she needs to let this story go and move onto other things. She never reads anything but LotR and constantly talks about it when discussing her own work like, ""oh yeah I should add that, just like that bit in LotR!"" Its like she can't see what she's even doing at this point, only measuring herself against this insane standard and obsession with one single world state. At this point, she's made me almost hate LotR I'm so sick of hearing about it. 

My friend is convinced that her story (a court would not rule that it was hers) needs to be told and that there's a place for it in the publishing world. I have written a list of criticisms from her latest edit she sent me, which I also coupled with generous and inventive praise but... even with the praise she will be crusher. The basis of my criticism is ""you need to stop, this will never be published, please stop devoting your life and time to this.""

Co-worker 3 really likes the ice-cream from the parlour we got coupons for, but he doesn't care for the fifteen minute walk there. Co-worker 4 is only in the office one day per week.

1254,"WIBTA if I told my friend she sounds pretentious when she pronounces IKEA with European inflections?   

Background: In the USA, advertisements for IKEA pronounce the store name “AYE-kee-yah” **NOT** with the typical Swedish pronunciation of “Eee-KEH-Yah”. 

This is not an earth shattering problem but a group of friends is divided on whether we should say something or not to a mutual friend. We opened this account to get an impartial judgement.

Our friend and coworker Lillian (F50) is a kind, funny, generous person who historically has awful taste in men. We’ve seen her date bullies, borderline alcoholics, and generally just jerky people. She has this weird fixation on fixing bad boys. None have been overtly abusive rather just garden variety obnoxious people.

Her latest boyfriend Rotterdam (M51) is more than a bit of jerk. For the sake of this post, we just want to ask about fake accents. 

Rotterdam’s mother is American, his father is Dutch, he was born in the US but he lived in The Netherlands between the ages of 10 and 17 years old. He moved back to the USA to finish high school and attend college and thus has lived in the USA for the last 30 years. But he self identifies as strictly Dutch.

He has informed us that it is the Dutch national tradition to insult people and that we should just accept his verbal abuse as part of his national heritage. He has said this to me and others in our friend circle directly before laying out insults. Unsurprisingly, he’s the type that likes to dish but can’t take it back without losing his temper.

We love our friend and have genuinely tried to accept her partners. She gets very defensive and will double down on defending her boyfriends even over us asking a minor question about their habits or treatment of her.

So…

Rotterdam has now convinced Lillian that she should start pronouncing words with Dutch or European accents because “European is the correct way to say things”. She has never lived in Europe nor visited The Netherlands.

Which brings us to the dilemma. WWBTA if we called her out on how pretentious she, as an American, sounds when she pronounces IKEA using an “European style” pronunciation when IKEA’s own TV and radio advertisements in the US pronounce the store name the American style?

1261,"AITA for going to my daughter’s favorite movie theater? For a year, me (44M) + my daughter (15F), E, haven’t been in contact. 

E cut me off after I cheated on exwife (43F) with a 27F I met @ a hotel on a work trip (gf) . After 8 mo of the affair + therapy, my wife (A) decided to divorce. It’s a long story but this was for the best. E disagreed- she told me I was throwing my life away w gf. I gave them a  great settlement- they keep our house, I keep my mom’s house. I make generous support payments. I agreed to concede custody of E, who then gave me an ultimatum- I either broke up w gf, or lost contact w her. I chose to lose contact w her, hoping she’d come to her senses. We haven’t seen each other or spoken since, except for when she called me to yell @ me for not reaching out on her bday, or when she texts me to ask for money. Me + A still talk, and she mentioned to me a new theater in town that her + E love. She told me to avoid it so E wouldn’t have to run into me + gf, who has since moved to the US and into my mom’s house w me shortly after my mom died. But a few mo later, gf began asking me to go to the new theater. We began going. 

One night, E sees our car in the parking lot. She calls me in a rage, screaming, crying + telling me to leave, along w using vulgar language. Fortunately, the theatre has a good return system, so I left. A then called me + told me not to return, but I told her I refuse to be banned from places when we live in the same town. Me + gf continued to go, and E began occasionally txting in advance to tell me not to go to the theater that night, which I respected. E saw my car + begged me to leave 2x more- and I did. 

A few weeks later, me + gf were @ an indie movie (this theater shows movies that chain theaters don’t, which is why I haven’t stopped going.) Apparently, E was in the audience w friends. After the movie, she called me in tears, calling me a motherfucker + a vile human being. She told me not to go back to the theater, saying I had humiliated her in front of friends. I refused to be barred from the theater, and hung up when she began calling gf a whore. I then called A to  tell her that E should not use bad language toward me, and threatened to lessen E’s future payments + car allowance. A then berated me, saying that if I couldn’t respect E, she shouldn’t respect me. She also mocked gf’s height + spending habits, calling her a whore. She then threatened to make me have visitation with E under a morality clause, which means gf can’t stay in my house during visits. I hung up, humiliated by this in front of gf. 

E + A are both mad @ me for refusing to not return to the theater, but I think I shouldn’t be banned from a public place, especially when it’s the only one showing the indie movies gf + I love. They have argued that since we never went together and me + gf didn’t go until after A’s warning, I shouldn’t return. I’m willing to not go on nights when E has tickets, but I don’t think I should be banned. AITA?","YTA

During the last few months, I made some friends and one among them was a girl (same age), let's call her R. I was always kind of attracted to her and I felt that she too was. She also knew that I was in a committed relationship. A few days back,  I decided I would let her know how I felt. I asked her out for a movie. Before and during the movie, I had multiple chances to make a move on her but I could not because I wanted her to know (before anything happened) that I was not interested in a relationship. After the movie, when we were in a secluded area, I directly said to her, ""Hey, I know I'm making this awkward for us but can we be like friends with benefits?....My gf knows."", to which she casually replied 'Nooooo'. I said I was really sorry and she said that it's okay. We parted our ways-SHE shook my hand (I was too embarrassed to even look at her).

&#x200B;

My girlfriend and I tend to watch movies as we eat dinner most nights. I really enjoy this, but the only problem is it usually takes until we’ve finished eating to decide what movie to watch. (My girlfriend can be very picky and indecisive, which can be cute until it gets to a point where it impedes on our plans.) So last night I decided to skip the usually 30+ minute decision period and immediately put on a movie as soon as we sat down. I didn’t ask her what she’d like to watch or tell her the decision I made – the movie simply started playing. She asked about it and I told her not to worry and that she would really like it. She got really upset and told me to turn it off. She refused to even watch five minutes of it or give it a chance simply because I chose it without her.

She wasn't upset initially. It was only *after* She asked about what you were watching and you wouldn't tell her that she became upset. I don't know how the conversation went, but from the sounds of her reaction she may have asked a couple of times. 

She's telling you that she doesn't like not having that communication. she doesn't like choice being taken from her.

I ended up uninviting my dad from Thanksgiving dinner after he told me about this new woman because I was so angry, which led to him and my grandparents (dad's parents) hating me. When I uninvited him, I told him that he was disgusting and it was disrespectful to my mom, and that he could spend Thanksgiving dinner alone thinking about how his dead wife would feel knowing he found someone new a month after her death. He ended up spending Thanksgiving with his new girlfriend. 

Meanwhile, his daughter (me) is still a complete mess after the death, and I realized he seemed to be doing just fine since he's able to say, ""I love you"" to this new woman and talk about moving in with her at some point soon. I just couldn't stand the thought of looking at him during dinner knowing that he had a new girlfriend. He kept telling me, ""it just happened"", ""give her a chance"", ""it's my life and I can do what I want"", etc. 

My dad was always verbally abusive towards me and my mom, so I've literally spent my whole life walking on eggshells not to upset my dad. My mom always used to protect me from him and keep him in line, since he always called me the worst daughter in the world. We didn't talk for the month between Thanksgiving and a few days before Christmas. Obviously I needed time to cool down. I called him and texted him a few times during that month, but he ignored all of my attempts at contact.

In that month, I learned that people have a lot of opinions about this subject. Some people say it's way too soon and agree with me and others say that what I did was awful and to just let my dad be happy.

I decided to be the better person and invite him to Christmas Eve dinner, and then he drops it on me that the only way he'll go is if I invite his new girlfriend. I wanted us to all be together since it's the first Christmas without my mom, so I reluctantly agreed. I just sucked it up and pretended to be nice to this woman while my dad kept comparing her to my mom, and then saying he wasn't comparing them when I pointed out that he was.

1276,"WIBTA if I wrote an apology letter to an old friend who cut me out of his life for being toxic? Hi all!

I feel like I should start by saying I'm a female. Years ago I was really close friends with this guy in my friendship group, from middle school and throughout college. We liked each other at different points, but never at the same time. We became gradually closer and closer and to this day, he is one of the closest friendships I've ever had. It got pretty clear that we both had a little more affection for each other than just friends, but I was fine with just a little bit of flirting, I didn't actually want to be in a relationship with him. I should have drawn that clear boundary, but didn't, because I liked the attention I got from him liking me romantically. I was extremely insecure in hindsight in my late teens/early 20s and romantic interest from guys was the ultimate form of validation so I would actively seek it out. Fucked up, I know.

One night when I visited his college, we got high together in his room and made out, though I had a bf at the time. I broke up with the bf shortly after. After I broke up with my bf and I still wasn't interested in having a relationship with my friend, it became crystal clear to him that it wasn't just that we couldn't be together because I was in a relationship, I actually just didn't like him as much as he liked me. He was really hurt and didn't want his mind to continue to be pre-occupied by this toxic relationship, so he cut me out of his life and told me not to contact him anymore so he could move on. But he made it very clear that I had done no wrong (that's how much I had convinced him how innocent I was) and that this was just something HE needed to do for himself.

Now in my late 20s I can reflect back and see that I was toxic af. I led him on, whether intentionally or unintentionally, and really hurt him by actively engaging in his feelings for me, even though I knew I didn't want to be with him. I did this with other guy friends after him and lost them all for the same reasons, before I realised that I wasn't some innocent girl who was so unlucky that all her guy friends fell for her, but rather I was complicit in all of those failed friendships and I treated them all horribly for my own gain. I want to write him a letter and deeply apologise for everything I did to him and tell him that I know now that the way I treated him was in no way acceptable, that I regret my behaviour deeply, and I hope he's doing well for himself and is happy.

I was pissed after that but he had friends over and I didn't want to embarrass him. I then went down stairs for some breakfast just for what do you expect? thats right 2 empty cereal boxes and NO MILK but all back in the fridge/cabinet (side not why do teenage boys eat so much? like god damn). I had enough and I had to talk to him if he had friends over or not, turned out he was working out and when he sweats he smells TERRIBLE. I couldn't even be in the workout area without gaging and almost crying from the stench. I was pissed at him now but just waited.

His friends left like 30 minutes later and he came to talk to me still smelling like shit, everything that has happened today and then still smelling him I just lost it I can't remember what I said but I remember saying something like ""you need to pick up your act, girls don't like that shit, especially the smell and toilet peeing"".  To him I was giving him a lecture him and he didn't like that.  He told me to shut the fuck up and then went to his room.  neither of us left the house after that so we just sulked in anger for the rest of the day.  

I didn't mean to snap at him, I just want him to pick up his act for my sake and his sake in a couple years. We aren't really speaking but I have texted him a somewhat long text saying that I'm sorry for how I said it but not sorry for what I said (if that makes sense).

I never expected anything vulgar from her until today when she was rushing out the door for school I noticed she dropped her sketchbook so I went to bring it to her and to my surprise- there was multiple pages of nude drawings of men AND a women. I was appalled. Don’t get me wrong I understand the concept of this for artists and that it’s normal for artists but my daughter is only 14. She has absolutely no business with these types of drawings. She was out the door before I could say anything. Obviously they cannot allow nude models in school so the only other explanation is that she has been viewing the images on 18+ websites. I did what I had to and went on her laptop (which her father and I paid for, btw) to see the history and as suspected a website full of adult nude models and even google searches for specific poses. I waited until my daughter got home and confronted her, i tried to be calm as I could and explained that she has no business viewing 18+ images and those models can get in big trouble if the police find out and underaged girl is viewing them. I told her I would then be confiscating her sketchbook and laptop until she agrees to draw something more age appropriate. i think that this is fair as she can have her stuff back immediately once she agrees, but she is mad and refusing to give in.

1299,"AITA for letting my coworker think we're friends when I really don't like her? This has been going on for a while, so I'll try to keep this as short as possible. (Still might end up kinda long though, lol.)

I (26F) have been at my current job for about a year, and from literally day 1 I've been in a difficult situation with one of my coworkers (39F). On my first day she invited me out to lunch with her, which I accepted since I didn't know her yet and thought she was just giving me a warm welcome, but ever since then she's sort of stuck herself to me as though that one lunch date made us best friends. 

The problem is, I don't really see her that way at all: she's 13 years older than me, we barely have anything in common, and she unintentionally draws a lot of attention to herself, while I'm the kind of person who wants to stay in the background as much as possible.

Since that first day she always assumes I want to eat lunch with her, so on days that we have the same lunch break I either have to make up an excuse not to go, or take the L and end up going with her to eat somewhere, which only deepens things. 

She also has this fixation with wanting to hang out with me on a day that we're off from work, which I've avoided so far, but she still asks at any chance she can get. I try to distance myself from her, so I've barely told her anything about myself, but she always shares deeply personal things about herself that make me uncomfortable, and in the middle of regular conversations she'll throw in how happy she is that she met me, call me her best friend, etc. even though she hardly knows anything about me.

On top of all that, I've got a pretty bad case of social anxiety, so I cant stand conflict at all. So while the obvious solution to all this is to just be honest with her about how I feel, that's not realistically something that I could do. I usually communicate in hints and body language, which has worked with everyone else up until now, but she's either never picked up on it or is choosing not to. 

And it's not like I haven't tried at all; I've told her a few times that i don't want to hang out with her outside of work because it takes me a really long time to think of my coworkers as friends, which took a lot of courage for me, but she seems it take it as a challenge that that needs to spend even MORE time with me so that I'll be comfortable enough to go to her house soon. So that's how this has gone on for so long; it would have been easiest for me to be totally honest with her at the beginning, but I hoped she would back off after a while, and then it became too late. 

I know it's at least partially my fault for allowing this to go on for so long and letting her think we're besties. But none of this would have happened if she weren't so presumptuous from the start, and not paying any attention at all to the things I say and do around her. So...AITA?","Sorry but yeah, YTA. Leading someone on is never cool, even if it's just a friendship. I get it, you don't like conflict, but that's on you, not on her, and when you're an adult sometimes you have to deal with conflict, even if you don't like it. She may be oblivious to your hints, but some people are and that's not really their fault.

1302,"AITA for being mad about how my boyfriend’s new job is affecting our relationship? UPDATE: Thank you for the responses. Although many said there’s NAH, I do feel like I let my emotions overwhelm me. My mental health isn’t his responsibility and I need to work on that. I also didn’t really know what I was asking for out of him, I was just upset. But I realize now it’s NOT that I want him to magically make more time for me or something.

I ended up texting him right after seeing the first response. I basically said I feel like it’s been harder to make time for one another recently and that I love him and am proud of him for taking on this job, and I in no way blame him or want/am asking him to change his working situation, but it’s hard nonetheless. It went well, I tried my best to make it clear I don’t need more “me” time or want to exhaust him further. We agreed that after he gets home from work he needs a few hours to himself to recharge, then we’ll FaceTime in the evening. And to be clear — I never said I was going to not support him or ask for more out of him. This was never going to be a dealbreaker or a “demand”, I love him so much and I would do anything to make it work. Thanks again, Reddit!


Original post:


Throwaway because he knows my main account. I’ll try and keep this as short and simple as possible —

So my boyfriend of over a year recently got a job that requires, on average, 11 hours a day, 5 days a week. It’s manual labor and I can’t imagine how difficult it is for him and how tiring it must be, and he needs the money for college so I would never ask him to get a different job for my sake.  We’re also doing long distance right now so we mostly call and FaceTime. 


Part of me feels so guilty because I know his job is so demanding and I work as well, and I can hardly compare my job to his (I’m working in retail to save up some money as well, but way less). But the past couple weeks there have been some times I feel annoyed or upset with him and I feel like it’s not anything more he needs on his plate, and I’d look dramatic and not understanding. Stuff like him falling asleep when I feel like I need someone to talk to, etc. I brushed it off because I know he’s tired. 

Today, I was just in a crappy mood and I was trying my best to pull myself out of it. I talked to my boyfriend a bit but we ended up calling on the phone in the late afternoon (5ish) when he got home from work. I’m feeling really sad (I struggle with mental health a bit) and it’s just really nice to have him there for me. I can tell he’s tired though so I tell him it’s ok, go nap. He ends up falling asleep until 9:30pm. Now I’m feeling upset because this seems to keep happening and I really needed him. 

I don’t want to be the asshole but I worry I am. He’s working hard, he’s tired. But he’s also my boyfriend and the feeling of not having someone there for you when you need it at times can be rough. Anyways, AITA for being upset with him? 

TL;DR: Boyfriend started a new, very tiring job. He’s always exhausted and I feel a bit neglected but can’t really blame him. However, I’m getting annoyed. AITA?","Yes. YTA.

1304,"AITA for passing people on the right lane? For context, I tend to drive and camp out on the right lane unless I need to pass someone. Most people have a tendency to sit in the middle lane or the left so I find the right to be the most open. On top of that, I have a bit of a lead foot and maintain a speed usually well above the limit. This means I'm usually passing everyone to the left of me, even folks who think they're ""passing"" on the left. 

My boyfriend tells me this makes people nervous and I shouldn't pass on the right. He also says that people getting on the highway will freak out cuz of how fast I'm going. If the left lane were clear and there were cars on the right, I'd use the left lane but now if I try to be on the left I find myself weaving through several lanes to maintain my speed. Otherwise, I'd constantly be tapping the breaks. 

IMO I'm using the freeway correctly and if people are not passing, they should be in the right lane which would force me over to the middle/left lanes. Secondly, I think if you're entering the highway its your responsibility to get up to speed and judge if the cars that are already in the lane are going faster than you can speed up to in time. If you can't, then enter behind those cars. 

So I'm here to ask all the people I pass on the right, AITA?

1307,"AITA for coasting into a red light instead of accelerating and braking? So yesterday I was driving down a 55mph road that has stoplights about every half mile. I was in the left lane out of two and traffic was fairly heavy. I went through a green light and saw a res light and queue about a quarter mile away. Rather than continue to accelerate past like 40ish, I opted just to coast the distance to the queue and eventually came to a complete stop. The light changed a couple of seconds later and queue in front of me cleared a couple seconds after that. A car behind meanwhile was furious that I was doing this and was tailgating and flashing lights as if I was doing something wrong. 

The way I see it, I covered the same distance in the same time while using less gas and wearing out my brakes and tires less. I get that I was in the left lane but I feel that on this road that doesn’t have easements feeding into it and has left turn movements at every light, the slow-traffic-keep right dynamic doesn’t really apply, especially since I’m still moving at the highest possible average speed. Possibly I wasn’t letting people 25 cars behind me make the light that I went through, but then the road’s throughput is reduced by more frequent stopping and starting so if anything, I may have been helping the cars behind me by keeping my lane moving at a more constant speed rather than creating abrupt stops.  

So AITA?",YTA. Get out of the left lane. I'm a pretty calm driver but someone coasting  below the speed limit not even attempting to make a good distance would irk me. Ride in the right lane if that's your style.,1,YTA,0.0,0.0,1

1314,"AITA for telling my nephew Santa isn't real in a game of 20 Questions? Well, the title basically sums it up, but I might as well tell the full story.

My BIL was doing a get-together for his birthday. Eventually, though, everybody started getting drunk, so I was about to leave, before my nephew spotted me and begged me to stay. So, I went in his room where he and my sister were waiting for BIL's friends to all go home. He suggested that we play 20 Questions, that game where someone thinks of a character for you and you have to figure out who it is my asking 20 or less yes-or-no questions. He wanted to go first, so my sister wrote *Santa Claus* on a piece of paper and taped it to his forehead.

The way we played it was that he would ask the questions while my sister and I would take turns answering them. Eventually it got to the question that was obviously going to come up and I was lucky enough to be the one forced to answer it.

""Is he a real person?""

Truth be told, I was actually thinking about how I should answer this from the moment we started the game, since I knew it was almost certainly going to come up. My sister hasn't spent Christmas with us since she got married, so I had no idea if her son knew Santa isn't real yet or not. I remembered how our dad told us the truth about Santa when I was 5/6 and my sister was 6/7 (which I do realise is quite early). I also thought back to how our daughter figured the truth out by herself when she was 7. Ultimately, though, my though process was this: surely my sister wouldn't choose Santa for this game if she expected to read her mind and go along with pretending that he's real. So, without hesitation, I blurted out, ""No."" Perhaps if I waited a bit before answering, my sister would have coughed or something to let me know that she wants me to lie, but alas, the milk was spilled and all I got from her was a disapproving glance.

My nephew soon ran out of questions and his final guess was Mario (he was able to figure out that it's a fictional character who's fat, has facial hair and dresses in a bright colour). Once he realised that it was actually Santa, he immediately pointed out that I said the character wasn't real. My sister tried to tell him that I said it by accident and I tried to go along with it, but eventually her son started crying. She seemed quite pissed and told me that ""I should go"".

On my drive home I started to feel increasingly guilty and today I woke up (quite late) to a bunch of messages from both my sister and BIL calling me an asshole who ruined Christmas for their son. Admittedly, I have no idea what age kids normally find about Santa out at, but 9 still feels like pretty old to still believe and get *that* upset upon finding out the truth. Apparently, though, he made quite a scene about it, both last night and this morning. I, of course, apologised, but BIL still said that I'm not getting invited to any more get-togethers. I'm sure this won't last and we'll all make up soon, but I would like to know if I really am the asshole in this situation or not.",You know based on the title I was gonna go hard YTA but I’ll go soft YTA since you were set up by your sister.

A group of friends and I were taking a road trip to Vegas. One of my friends has a giant 8 seater so we were obviously going to take his car for the road trip. We never explicitly stated that we were going to split it the price but I think it was understood to everyone that we would.

Once we get all of our friends together and we're about to head out, we stop at the gas station because the tank is empty. I figured my friend who's driving would pay for it himself and then every time it gets filled after that we would split it. But he asked everyone to chip in.

I thought it didn't make sense because the tank is empty before the start of our trip and it doesn't make sense to pay for gas that we didn't even use. But no one bats an eye and they all end up paying. Would I have been the asshole for refusing or at least arguing?

Fuel is only a very small portion of the cost of operating a vehicle. Even if he started with an empty tank and ended with a full one, your buddy was absorbing most of the travel cost himself by supplying the vehicle that was used.

I was with my girlfriend for 6 months and everything was great.  We didn't fight much since it was pretty early on into the relationship, and I'm not really a contentious guy.  Then, she told me that she got plastic surgery...  We're both Korean and Koreans are known for their plastic surgery.  I've always been completely against any type of procedure that changes your appearance.  Her surgery wasn't anything major, it was just double eyelid surgery.  For those not in the know, double eyelid surgery is very popular, especially for asians.  I'm not sure about the numbers, but I'm pretty sure a large amount of asians do get them and they're not really seen as a big deal.  However, to me it is.  I became distant with her and could not get rid of the negative thoughts that started to form in my head.

The part that really bothered me was the fact that she would spend money to change her appearance, albeit slightly, because she wasn't satisfied with the way she looks.  I know some might say what's the difference between that and makeup, but just the idea of permanently changing your appearance does not sit well with me.

So I decided to end the relationship with her.  I met with her and ended the relationship but I did not tell her the reason was because of her surgery.  I just assumed that it might be best not to tell her because she might start to hate herself for getting the surgery or become self conscious about her appearance.  I was really flustered and just told her it's because of personal reasons and did not get into details at all.

She texted me a few times throughout the week asking me what the problem was and what she did wrong, but I just kept telling her I didn't wanna talk about it and eventually ignored her (or responded very late) to her messages.

On my way to the beach today, there was a woman on her ground level balcony (patio?) playing very loud Chris Brown renditions of Disney music. I could hear it from my room (second floor) with the windows and doors closed. When I walked pasted the bar, there was a solo dude playing reggaeton on his phone and intermittently singing out loud. 

The bar generally is the only unit playing music, and today they weren't. I believe it's because there would be three competing and different songs playing. The person on the patio and the person on the beach were out before the bar opened (11am). The solo dude ( hotel guest) on the beach had no one around him, empty beach chairs in both directions. But with people on the beach in both far directions, including hotel guests. I was immediately frustrated because A) how inconsiderate/unaware can you be? B) in what world is this okay? (No seriously, educate me.)

I moved down the beach, and was still able to hear both songs playing. I just wanted to relax and read a book. It was incredibly distracting and very unrelaxing. Both of these people were not Americans, and I was trying to be really culturally conscious of what does and does nother bother other people in a different country/part of the world. But I was pissed. I don't want to hear your music. It's a no brainer that's rude, (right?). The hotel groundsman complimented the reggaeton music, and started a positive conversation with the solo dude about the singer. The bartender, closer to the patio woman, paid no mind to her music. There is such a culture of positivity here, I felt like a dick for even being bothered. But honestly, what the fuck? You know you can hear each other's music, and you know everyone else can hear the both of you. I could not make sense of their thought processes. 

I remained quiet because I felt like path of least resistance was the correct option.  And after one hour the patio woman turned her music off, and the solo dude on the beach left. So, whatever. 

But, WIBTA if I (politely) approached either about the volume of their music? Is that entitled? Am I missing something? Should I have not taken it so seriously? The hotel staff weren't bothered, they didn't enforce any noise rule. The beach is at least public. Who am I, after all? Incredibly American? Guys, help me. This will happen again tomorrow.","Close one but i am gonna go with YTA

You say you were trying to be culturally conscious, but i feel like after all you were not. My rule of thumb would be: Whenever you visit a different country and something is bothering you, look out for the reaction of the locals and see if they are bothered aswell. If not, maybe you are imposing your idea of what the unspoken rules of the situation are on them (excluding things that are illegal or dont bother others because the treament is directed at you personally).",1,YTA,0.0,1.0,0

Flex your communication skills and talk to her about how the changes are impacting you. Don't go in angry because you're assuming that people don't understand the impact or expect the same results; instead, go in calm, talk about the impact the changes are having, and talk about how to handle that impact. If you're struggling with the work itself, ask for help. If you radiate your frustration with your own difficulties all around you, it looks like you're pissed off at everyone - and that makes you look hostile. Most people don't like anger, because it often leads to unpleasant things (screaming / hitting / bad decisions).

1324,"AITA for being annoyed to be the ‘taxi driver’? This is my first post and english is not my first language. 

I (24F) really wonder if I am the AH. Last night I went to a party and since I didn’t want to return home too late I took my car so I could get back in about 10 minutes. In my friends group there is this girl I’m not too close to. During the party she asked me  if I could take her home, and I agreed to, even if I wasn't too happy about it: to take her home I needed to pass in front of my house and then drive for another 20 minutes 'till her house and then 20 back. I feel like she was the asshole to ask me for a drive knowing how far she lives from me (she even acted as if we are neighbors, which we definitely are not). I didn’t let her guess I was annoyed and just drove her home. When I arrived home my mum (the best human being I know) was still up, so I explained the situation to her and she told me I was the asshole for being so annoyed and that I should have offered her a drive myself and not be selfish.
MY POINT IS:
- I think she was quite the asshole for imposing on me, since where I’m form it’s quite rude to say no (not the first time).
- I rarely take the car and it's just to get home faster, and every time (like 5 times out of 6) I have to take someone home. I feel like I am limited in taking my own car, because if instead of 10 minutes, it takes me 50 minute to get home, I prefer not to take the car at all and use a car-sharing (which she could have used) or take the bus or even go by feet (about 35 minute walk)
- I feel that since she didn’t know I was coming she had other plans for her return home and she should have sticked to them instead of asking me, expecially since we are more acquaintances than friends. 
- Also, when I told her yes, I explained I wasn’t planning to stay late and she agreed to go when I wanted. When I was ready to go (the party was already over and it was late), I had to call her at least 5 times since she was talking to a friend she literally sees every day. This really pissed me because I think it’s quite disrispectful to let someone you asked for a favor wait for you 10 minutes if she is in ‘a hurry’.
- Also, I would never ask someone to go so out of his way to take me home, unless I could repay the favor. But I’m the only one to take the car since the others want to drink, so I am always the driver. Plus, it’s not like I never want to drink, just that I prefer to get back home quickly, which lately is never possible. So I don’t drink and it takes me almost an hour to go back home. 

I don’t feel like the asshole for being annoyed and I think that the girl should not have asked me a drive and put me in an uncomfortable situation. 
The fact is that if I take the car again I would still take her back home, but now I don’t feel like taking the car anymore, which I think it’s unfair. But my mum says I should just not take it anymore if I’m so annoyed. So AITAH?


Edit: A lot of people are telling I should have said No, the fact is that I obviously didn’t make clear that that was non an option. Where I am from it’s really rude to say no, so it’s also ‘polite’ non to ask directly or to make previous plans so the other can refuse and find an excuse. I know it’s difficult to understand but here you are rude even if you ask back for something (even money) you lent and to say no you need an ‘excuse’ or you are the AH. To be ‘polite’ you should ask the other if the has the car and hope he offers for a drive, because if you ask directly you are forcing the other. So my only option if I don’t want to drive for an hour home every single time, is non to take the car.","YTA she just asked you, you said yes and act like someone forced you. Just say no jesus.

We had the usual conversation in such circumstances, where we asked one another what we'd been up to. He graduated with a degree in English. Whem I asked what he does, he said he's an engineer. It went a little something like this:


""What do you do?""



""I work at an engineering lab by the airport.""



""So...what's your job title?""



""I'm an engineer.""



""You're an engineer? But you got a degree in English. So how is your title 'Engineer'?""

I can see it from his POV. He works hard and calls himself based on what he does. He doesn't pidgeonhole people based on qualifications or titles.



 It's not my place to knock people down a notch, but I didn't want my friend to mislabel himself. What if he went to a job interview and the interviewer called him out like did? At the same time, if he does the work, does the title matter? Not sure if I was an asshole here or not.

1343,"AITA for getting my roommate addicted to Juuling so that I could buy pods off her At my college, pretty much everyone Juuls/vapes/smokes cigs/dips. It’s really common for students to pick up this habit. I began Juuling the summer before my freshman year. My freshman year roommate had never Juuled before when we met, but she had drunkenly smoked cigs and dipped. 

Since we lived in a dorm, it was sometimes inconvenient to buy pods. Myself, including most of my friends, did not have a car on campus. Thus, we would have to walk about 15 minutes to the nearest gas station to purchase packs of Juul pods. This wasn’t always a problem, but sometimes rain or cold weather would make this trek difficult. 

Therefore, it became common to buy pods off of other people. For example, someone would ask in a dorm groupme if anyone had a pod they could sell. I would often use these group chats or my friends who juuled for an extra pod. Since it was often difficult to find someone, I had a great idea. If my roommate, who did not Juul, began Juuling, then I would have another person who I was close friends with and in close quarters with for pod purchasing.

I began by offering my roommate to hit my Juul. More and more, she would start hitting it. Also, several of our friends in our circle were Juuling often, so they began encouraging her too. I finally told her one day that she should buy her own Juul, and she agreed that it was a good idea. So I walked to the store with her and the next thing you know, she began Juuling often and was another person I could buy pods off of, as she also bought them off me. 

Flash forward a year: this former roommate is now still addicted, and I often see her not only Juuling but smoking cigarettes on her Snapchat. I don’t talk to her as much anymore, but she definitely has an addiction now. 

I feel bad for contributing to her addiction, but I also think that she probably would have started Juuling either way at this school. Also, I didn’t literally force her to Juul and get addicted. She had also tried nicotine before, so I didn’t introduce this to her. Am I an asshole for this? 

UPDATE: thank you all for responding, I realize now that what I did was wrong. I felt bad so I called her and told her everything. She actually thought it was funny and admitted that during our year as roommates, she tried to get me to drink more so that I would be drunk enough to let her hit my Juul and give her more alcohol when we were out.

1344,"AITA for starting an argument over my best-friend dating my brother, despite her promising not to? I want to preface this by saying that the relationship is not the problem itself. While uncomfortable to me I could eventually live with it and move past it. What I AM mad about is how they went about it and I want to know if I'm really the asshole for starting a huge argument over it.

&#x200B;

My friend, we'll call her Rachel, has been my best-friend for nearly 10 years. My older brother, Jake, has chatted with Rachel here and there but they never really interacted. This is in part due to me keeping my social, family and work life separate. I like having boundaries between my social groups.

&#x200B;

Well recently Rachel and Jake started messaging eachother really often. Some of my other friends had noticed who Rachel was messaging and they told me. I asked Rachel to stop and keep it platonic. Rachel agreed and said it was nothing serious and promised me that she wouldn't do anything that would make me uncomfortable (of her own accord).

&#x200B;

After a few months Rachel revealed that her and Jake were in a relationship now.

* Rachel was afraid to tell me. When brought back up she would say she couldn't ever do that to me.
* Jake convinced my family to hide it from me. My parents made sure I was distracted whenever Rachel dropped by.
* My parents bullied my younger siblings into hiding it from me.
* I asked Rachel to keep her distance while I processed this, to which she agreed to stay away, but she ignored it

I was mortified that she would lie to me like this *for months*. And that the two had included my whole family in the deception. And despite me being willing to move past it, she still couldn't respect my wishes and at least keep her distance while I sorted myself out internally. I was furious with her lying about this. I got emotional and went off at her over our messages, which made Jake confront me and that turned into a shouting match.

&#x200B;

My parents joined and took his side and said that I have no right to feel the way I do about their relationship. I tried to explain that it wasn't the relationship itself that made me so upset, it was what they all did to hide it from me. They refused to acknowledge that they did anything wrong and that they did the right thing so I wouldn't stop them (which I wouldn't of). I would of been okay had Rachel simply said ""I know it makes you uncomfortable, but I'm going to continue seeing Jake"" from the start.

&#x200B;

They insist that I'm only angry because of the relationship. I admit things got heated and I said my fair share of mean comments. It's been a couple of days since that argument and I've just shut myself in and cried. I told them that they broke my trust and that they owed me an apology for treating me this way. That I won't speak to them until they at least see this from my perspective. Jake and my parents have called me a bitch and an asshole for treating them ""so horribly"".

EDIT: There are a few missing points that people have brought up that I need to clarify. I have said nothing to them about the relationship, just their actions. Rachel promised of her own accord, not because I asked her to. Both Rachel and Jake were spoken to. I have not reacted negatively to the relationship, only their actions towards me.

EDIT 2: I will include a comment where I describe how the initial asking took place.

>My intial response when finding out was calm and was done amongst a group of friends. I stated my feelings, Rachel promised not to do that despite me not asking for her word, and was over quickly. As mentioned before the only times it ever came up after were as jokes with our friends.

Someone who knew brought it up and asked how I felt, I said I would prefer if Rachel didn't continue as it made me uncomfortable, and Rachel said she wouldn't. She said they were only talking and nothing had really happened and promised it would stay that way. I brought this up with Jake later as he deserved to be on the same page (his decision too).

 Whilst at university I worked every weekend and saved. When I finished university I used some of the money to go abroad and travel for 6 months.

When I returned in around 2015  I got a job, did a room share for cheap rent, got a second job on weekends (now working 7 days a week) and also did extra jobs fixing up and selling things on. By doing all this I was able to save fast and after 2 years I bought a 1 bed flat in 2017, just before this i got a better job (£40k increasing to 45k over a few years) and quit my other jobs so I was then just working 5 days a week. I also put away about 8k a year of my income towards my pension as I want to have a comfortable life when I'm older. I have continued to do side work since and spend probably 10-15 hours a week doing this.
I'm also doing additional training and working hard towards a promotion.


background on my gf (29f)

We met in 2016, we were together a year before I bought the flat, we were both involved in the decision of the area as we intended to live together and so I wanted her to be included. She wanted to go travelling and so quit her job and went away for about 6 months at the time I moved, we stayed together and she accrued about 5k in debt. On returning from travelling she came to live with me as we planned, and when she got a job we agreed she would pay me £200 per month towards bills. She got a job in the charity sector where she earns £19k. She has spent the past 18 months paying off her debt and is now debt free. She has a degree and has the experience and ability to get a well paying job. She In fact had an interview for a job that would pay more than me but did not go. she said she wants to work in the charity sector and despite not getting paid much, the money does not matter as much to her as helping others working for a charity. I have always supported her with her choices. She is also wanting to go away for a further 6 month period at some point to do voluntary work.

The situation now

We both love travelling and go away a few times a year, we have talked about getting married one day and starting a family and are about to start saving for a house together. 

AITA If I say that if she wants to continue working in her job then I will support her, but when the financial responsibility of a house and a family comes she is going to struggle. And without putting money away she will either have little money on retirement or have to work.

In my eyes I work hard for my money, and have made sacrifices in order to get financially ahead. My girlfriend has not and despite having the ability to earn what I do choses not to. Whilst I respect that decision should it not be her that struggles financially because of this, or am I expected to bear the financial burden of her choices?

Edit: to clarify if we had children I would be more than happy to take full financial responsibility whilst she was not working. Or if she became ill and couldn't work or something unforseen happened and I would be happy to take the financial burden in this case. It's the current case where she is choosing her job where I am wanting to do a 5050 split



Edit:

Thankyou for some of your comments. Some have been very helpful and I have not been able to comment on all the helpful ones so I apologise for that. After seeing some of these I changed my way of thinking so that an equitable share would in my view be fair and reasonable.

I think there is some misunderstanding. We currently and always have split things 50/50. My gf has never had an issue with this and we have never argued about money. My title was poorly worded and i have not spoken to her about this before now. I am just thinking longer term as we want to save for a house etc. Also some people seem to think I would be buying a house she could not afford, it was always the intention to buy a house where we could each afford the payments. 

I have sat down with my girlfriend and talked about this now, at first she was surprised as she always imagined us doing things 50/50. Saying it has not crossed her mind to do anything else. When we discussed the bigger financial commitment and the bigger capacity of mine to pay more towards bills we both agreed that an equitable bill share is fair.

 talking about issues like this before they are issues is important to me so we can both agree on common ground and know what to expect. Thankyou again  to the helpful comments that helped me see that a flat 50/50 is not reasonable for a long term relationship.","YTA. Oh, lord.

She's really beautiful but there's a bit of an age gap. She's 31 I'm 23. On the plus side I look a lot older than I actually am, and so because of this I convinced her that I was the same age as her. 

I finally convinced Louise to give me her number and we chat for hours. We're going on a date later today but I'm not sure if I should continue lying about my age. 

The only reason I did is was that the last time I was talking to a woman, it was going well until the moment I revealed I was younger than her. At that point she said it wasn't right. A lot of women don't give younger guys a chance so this seems like the best way.

After a week of conflicting work schedules, we agreed to play it on Wednesday, as he had off, and I would be getting off early enough to dedicate a couple solid hours to it. Fast forward to Wednesday, after I get off work, and he's in the kitchen, talking on the phone with a friend, and saying that he'll ""be right over"".

1355,"AITA for not taking care of my sick girlfriend? So I started dating this girl in college. I'm bi and she was the first girl I ever dated and things were going pretty well. I was her first kiss and we were pretty into each other. So during the weeks leading up to finals week, she found out that she had mono and it was a pretty bad case. She didn't tell me just how bad it was, but I knew that she couldn't really get out of bed or make herself food, and that she had to have IV fluids because she was so dehydrated from the fever. When I came over to make her food or do work with her, she wouldn't seem like she was dying or anything. She was on top of the essays she needed to write (she wrote them when her fever dipped for a few hours) and I was definitely not. When her temperature went up, she would start shivering and I could feel how feverish she was. During the two weeks she was really sick, I bought her groceries once and visited her three times, but she kept asking if I could come study with her (just sitting on the couch with her or something) and make her scrambled eggs because she couldn't stand for long enough to do that.  
I have anxiety and an eating disorder. These issues get especially bad during the weeks leading up to finals week, and I was in a really bad place. Most days, I would just sit on my bed shaking and trying to write papers. I told my girlfriend I was sick with a chronic thing and really struggling with the amount of work I was doing. She would keep texting me, with motivational memes or updates on how she was doing and I would leave her on read because I just couldn't mentally handle responding.

Kids have earned a fun vacation. Co worker suggested setting up a gofundme. I'd feel like an asshole using it for a vacation when there are so many people with real problems (cancer,total loss,etc).


I've been told by friends and co workers that it's reasonable but I'm not sold.
Every year I try to take my kids on a vacation. Not because I want to spoil them, but because I wasn't fortunate enough to experience anything like a family vacation as a kid. I want my kids to grow up having had the opportunity to see the country and make  memories. 
2017:road trip through CO, WY, SD. We explored Denver, camped Yellowstone, and visited Mt Rushmore.
2018: went back to Denver for a weekend and then went to SF to visit family and see the Golden gate bridge, alcatraz, ocean, the full house house, etc.
 This year would be San Diego. zoo, safari park, sea world, museums, etc.
I had saved $3500 to pay for a vacation, but ended up having to use it to pay taxes, and something else that I can't remember at the moment, but I'm sure it was important.
I decided to sell my old jeep. Nothing special, but I could net enough money to fund the trip. That money ended up buying new clothes (I was letting my daughter help me do laundry and bleach looks a lot like detergent to a 10 year old), then an engine repair on my car that cost a good chunk, and lastly my dog had to have blood tests and x-rays due to unexplained weight loss (he's fine, it was due to chickens eating his food)
On top of that my daughter and I both needed new glasses (no vision insurance), and their mom impulsively quit her job so now I'm solely paying for the kids summer program.
My kids aren't spoiled but they're not deprived of much either.
I grew up without the luxury of vacations, or even going to the zoo. My mom (single mom) made good money but wasn't really wired to have kids. sister and I were left to entertain ourselves.
I love spending time with my kids as much as I can. They're good kids, don't get into trouble at school, they're in the top of their class (as much as elementary kids can be),polite, respectful, helpful, and I feel like they earn and deserve a vacation.
That being said, as someone who was raised without vacations or outings, I don't think it would be the end of the world if we missed a year.
I just know they'll be disappointed. They've been looking forward to it. (I don't promise them a vacation or tell them when or where it will be, they just know that we're eventually going on a vacation)
  Here's why I think I'd BTA for setting up a gofundme.
There's tons of gofundme pages for people with REAL problems. Cancer, Sick children, families that lost everything, etc. People in dire need of money to simply survive. It seems assholish to divert money from them to pay for a vacation.","YWBTA vacations are not a necessity, i get why you want to give your kids one but if you don't have the money then you shouldn't go or ask other people to fund one.",1,YTA,0.0,0.0,0
1363,"AITA for buying my wife a gift that ""she didn't need"" for her birthday? My wife had her guitar stolen before a gig four months ago. She had a backup so it never affected her work but she said she would save up for a replacement of comparable quality to that one because it meant a lot to her.

I thought I'd be a good husband and today, for her birthday, I gave her a guitar. I bought it two weeks ago and kept it hidden until this morning. I don't know much about guitars so I tried to get something a similar color to the one that was stolen and let the shop employee guide the rest of my purchase. I spent $600, her guitar that was stolen was $1800.

She got upset at me for ""spending \[our\] money foolishly"". She said she'll never use it because it's not the same or even close to what she had or has in other guitars. This sounds like NTA territory but she followed it up with ""you should never buy someone a musical instrument because it's a personal decision"" which made me question whether I made the right choice at all. 

She told me she appreciated my attempt to help but this was money spent that will go to no use, and if I wanted to do this again, talk to her beforehand. She said we could have pooled our money and got a replacement for what she had stolen.

I don't know anything about guitars or even instruments in general. If it wasn't a good guitar I'm sure she could upgrade it or something to be good, right? It's a pretty piece of wood with strings on it, isn't that what determines the price? She doesn't think so and now I have to try and return this when I know it's past the return/exchange period.

3 months ago, we took her and brought her to our apartment where we had no other animals so she finally had a home where she felt comfortable and wasn’t always scared and under alert like before.

on a selfish note i’ve been wanting my own cat for sooo long.. and today there were free kittens being given away only an hour away from us. I told her about it and she said no, it would make her uncomfortable because she’s worried about her cat  but ultimately it’s my decision

later i went to go see the cats anyway because... kittens.. and i wasn’t sure about getting one because i didn’t want her to feel betrayed by me or upset, but i figured it wouldn’t hurt to try and if it didn’t go well then i’d find the kitten a better home. so i went for the opportunity anyway and got the kitten.

It happened to be a day when we were in the area (approx an hour away from our house) so we decided to stop in and get some cupcakes, NOT the special GoT ones, just their regular flavors.

So these special GoT cupcakes ended up selling out online. When we got there, there was a literal line curving around building of people waiting on standby. We stepped in line, and waited about 15 mins, barely moving. An employee came outside and made an announcement that anyone waiting for GoT cupcakes would be at least a half wait.

Literally everyone ahead of us were waiting for these special cupcakes and I can hear them all chatting about it and moaning about the wait. My wife says she’s going to go in and ask if we aren’t waiting for those specific ones, can we just cut ahead and order their regular flavors. She enters and a minute later texts me to come inside. As I’m entering through the doors, the lady who’s first in line starts bad talking shit about me and my wife cutting the line and how far we and we need to wait and blah blah blah. 

I try to explain to her my wife asked the employees and we didn’t want the GoT cakes and she starts yelling at me that no she didn’t ask and it didn’t matter. So I start getting a little louder and telling her mind her own business and wait for her cupcakes and end up pulling the door shut in her face from the inside and calling her something like a “fucking maniac.”

They do decently well in school (my son has an average mark of 8/10 and my daughter has an average mark of 7/10). My son has always liked technology and the ""STEM"" fields. He has a dream to work at a large company developing robots. My daughter on the other hand is a bit more creative. She doesn't like math, science, or anything of that format. Her grades are an average of 4-5 in the STEM categories, while 8-9 in the humanitarian categories. 

They are in the same grade and will finish 12th grade this year (however they are at different schools). Then it is time for them to pick which uni to go to. There is an option offered for students to go abroad and study in a different country which they would both really like since our country is not developed, and I approve of this as it would give them life experience and teach them more as they will have higher quality professors. 

The issue with this is that it costs money. I can afford to send them both to a university in different countries if we sell our current apartment and I rent a smaller a smaller apartment to live in by myself until they come home and scrape by, as almost all of my salary will be going for their tuition costs, apartment, food, and other necessities. I am willing to do this, but only for my son, and I will explain why.

When he goes to a different country, he plans to study Computer Science and Mathematics as a dual-major. He takes it very seriously and has been studying every day (including the weekends) to make sure he succeeds at this university. He is very competitive and I couldn't be more proud of him.

My daughter on the other hand, not so much. She would like to study history which in my opinion simply is not worth the money. I have let her know of my stance of this, and I told her that if she wants my financial support she will have to go for a STEM-related field. We are not a rich family, we are very poor and I am not going to work 10+ hour shifts just for her to learn history. I told her she can go into psychology, or some kind of medicinal branch, but she said she wouldn't do well in school for that.

Now the larger problem comes in that when my son does move out to university, I will still have to cut down on a lot of costs, and the nearest university from us is a good 12+ hours away and they do not offer dorm rooms, so she basically has no choice even to go to university in our country.

First off, some context. I work closing shifts doing customer service at a chain supermarket (not naming it). We close each night at 11 pm. 

Today I had an old lady, maybe in her 60s, approach me at about 9 pm and explain to me that she had missed her bus to get home, and that she lived about 15 minutes away. She then asked me to call the police to help her get back.

I refused this right off the bat, but I offered to let her use the phone to call a cab or something similar; but she refused, saying she had no cash to pay with. At this point I went on break.

So we made an appointment and I had some x-rays and examinations done. Afterwards we went into the orthos office and she first complimented my teeth and said that they were almost perfect. She then went on to say that I have an 8 (mm?) Overbite and that I'd need a bite plate and have braces for three years.

I was crushed. Immediately started crying as soon as we left the office and had a major drop in confidence and motivation. It took me a while, but I came to terms and by the time I had to get them on it didn't seem too bad.

It was awful. The bite plate is huge and gives me a terrible lisp. And God it's just so painful. As soon as I got into the car I became a mess. And when I got home it was even worse, everytime i tried to talk or look at myself I would descend into a sobbing heap.

But it's not entirely that I look incredibly stupid, it's that I sound incredibly stupid. I have to talk much slower to even attempt to talk understandably, and even then I still sound like a 5 year old without front teeth.

I am forced to miss an event that I've been preparing for for about two months, because I sound much too ridiculous to be in character during my sad, serious song.

Obviously all of this has very much upset me, but it's only been one day since I've gotten them. This paired with the fact that I completely dont understand WHY I need braces, because my teeth are better than most people I know.

So I've been absolutely begging my mother to let me get them taken off. I honestly just dont feel like the pain is worth it, (mainly because I don't want to live past 30.) But shes standing firm

She completely believes that I need braces and if I dont deal with them now I'm going to be completely screwed in the future. To be clear, I think she only thinks this because she never got braces ""and never had parents that loved her enough to get her braces. She thinks that I'm being incredibly ungrateful and when she finally gave in to asking the orthos to get rid if my braces, she yelled at me to never ask for help when I'm an adult with jacked teeth.

I deeply regret getting braces and I'm scared I'm not going to get used to them in time to be able to maintain my grade in acting.

My mother doesn't understand my problems because hers were so much worse as a kid, so she just thinks I'm being an ungrateful prick. But I dont think I need and definitely dont want braces, which I made clear to her since I was told I needed them.

She is a very kind and caring girl, but I just felt we were out of subjects to talk about 5 minutes after a conversation started. At one point she was the one that started texting and I was often the one that 'ended' texting her. I tried to slowly text her less and less and asking her for dates less, to make myself less interesting/ 'loveable'. I did not want to hurt her feelings by ending it while she was still very in love with me. This went on for about 3 months before i finally decided the one-sided relationship had gone on for too long and I broke up with her. It turned out that she was still very much in love with me, same as when we first started dating. I just kept her on a leash for 3 months trying to make her fell out of love with me, the same way I fell out with her, but instead i might've hurt her more than when I had just broken up when I had nothing but friendly feelings for her...

1384,"AITA for not wanting to be involved in raising a child from a one night stand 20m and i'm In college with a 18f. I hooked up with this girl one time 7 months ago, used a condom and she said she was on birth control and 7 months later I get a call last week saying that she's pregnant and that it's up to me if I want to be involved in this child's life. She's not pursuing money (her family is filthy rich) and she just wants to know if I want to be a father and that the reason she hasn't contacted me is because she wasn't sure what my name was and she just found out.  I wonder if she was lying about being on birth control, I know I used a condom and did my part. If I would've known sooner I would've suggested an abortion or something. I'm not signing any papers saying i'm the father or claiming any father rights. I'm also getting a paternity test just to be 100% sure.

&#x200B;

I moved and am now 5 hours away from this girl and I don't see how I could throw my life plans away to be with a baby that I feel no attachment too and a girl I don't even know. I'm in nursing school and time strapped as it is. I know nothing about the mother. I grew up with a shitty father and I know from my experience that the kid would be better of with a non existent father then a shitty one. I told the girl that if she ever needed money I would help anomalously, but I do not want to be a father and that i'm sorry that she's going to have to go through being a single mother. I don't want kids and I'm fairly certain I would make a shitty father, due to not wanting to be a father. I also don't think that because I had sex one time, that it justify's me to have to raise a child and have the total responsibility of how this individual works out in life, I do realize that financially i'm required to support it and I have no problem doing that. I honestly think that the child would be better off without me in life and being with someone who teaches the child healthy boundaries and other things that I have no clue about. I also think that this girl will find a husband and he will hopefully be a good father and if she finds one then it is his child because he raised it.

&#x200B;

She's not holding me responsible and I'm not holding me responsible because what 20 year old wouldn't hook up with a pretty girl. I don't feel bad for the kid because she seems like the type to make a great mom and her family is financially and emotionally secure, meanwhile on my side I don't have family, my parents abused me so I left and my uncles and aunt's told me to fuck off when I needed them, So I don't have family. I honestly feel he's better off not knowing who I am and him knowing that his family from his mom's side is good and it being a mystery on his dads side of what he actually comes from. My side is white trash, supports trump religiously and i'm the first one to go to college. 

&#x200B;

If the kid got famous or became rich in the future I wouldn't come out of the woodworks and claim it because I don't see it as my child. If he came to me in the future when he got older, I would probably let him get to know me, but I wouldn't try to act like his dad. I don't want any part in raising a child.

1385,"AITA for not gating my cat upstairs since my allergic roommate moved in? I've rented a 5-bedroom, 2-story house with 4 roommates since July 2018. I'm the only person on the lease and have paid for the deposit ($500 of which is a non-refundable pet deposit), in full personally. My roommates venmo rent to me each month which I then send to our landlord. Since we moved in, my cat has been a roommate like any other. His food, bed, and litter are all upstairs where my bedroom is located.

Last month, my roommate's girlfriend moved in with him downstairs. She was supposed to move in in July, but personal issues delayed that move. Before moving in, she informed me that she had a cat allergy and she would like the cat kept upstairs. I agreed the cat's home would be upstairs.

Now that she's moved in, she's installed a pet gate at the top of the stairs, and has said that her allergies are too severe for the cat to be downstairs where her bedroom is located. It's worth knowing that the cat is 100% disallowed from her bedroom, but is normally allowed to be in our shared spaces.

AITA for being livid that she has dictated where my cat can go, and refusing to restrict him to upstairs? To me, this seems like major overstepping, but she says I've created a hostile environment for her since I was informed of her allergies. Reddit HALP! 

EDIT: Per usual for this sub, some people are very angry at me. Maybe roommate’s and my differences come from our background; I grew up on a farm with animal lovers, so to me it’s inconceivable to consider corraling an inside pet.

1386,"AITA for not wanting to try salvaging my project with my colleague? Basically, my colleague and I are doing a project for one of our curricular units in Uni; unfortunately, we discovered yesterday night that, according to two friends, we have a lot to do than what we thought - we had maybe 20% of what we needed to get a 50% grade. With the amount of work left to do within 2 days before the deadline, I lost motivation to keep trying. I even inicially suggested to my colleague that we should seek help, but she decided against it, saying we didn't have anything that could be helped on.

After giving it some thought, and discovering that flunking the curricular unit has no repercussions other than having to repeat it next year, I wanted to save myself the hassle and just flunk the unit and try to get a better grade next time, rather than delivering something half-assed.

One day one of my co-workers comes in my office and tells me she has brought her daughter (jr high age) into work because her internet is down at home, so if I see a girl walking around its just her. This co-worker has a back office where no one would even know the wiser her daughter would be in there unless she came out to use the bathroom. She could have not told me and I wouldn't have even known. This co-worker also has hundreds of patient charts stored in her office. The child may know better not to peek through them or whatever, but a simple glance and she could see a name, and what if the name was a fellow classmate and she said something to the classmate about it? Huge breach of HIPAA. I called my manager and told her, hey, I'm not trying to be a tattle tale, the employee told me the reason she brought her in and she has her in her office, which is full of patient charts. She made it seem like it was odd for the reasoning, but didn't make it seem like it was a big deal to have even brought her kid in. She also stated that another co-worker has also brought her daughter in as if to make it seem like its a normal thing. I looked through the policies and there isn't anything specifically mentioned about employees bringing in their children to have at work, but I did reach out to HR to get a clarification about it since I couldn't find anything. She stated:

""We have no provisions that would allow this. This would be very hard to manage, because of the variety of circumstances that could arise. Additionally, this would dramatically affect the ability to perform one’s job/position.

Not having a sitter would be a time that PTO would be utilized. That is why we have a generous attendance policy that allows multiple occurrences.""

I'm currently working 7 days - 12 hours a day so I didn't have time to do anything with her. She's also been pretty busy taking care of our kids, and doing the sports and stuff.

Anywho, I figured she could use a break, and I need to make up for her birthday anyway. So I planned for my mother to pick the kids up from her, and made a $230 appointment for a three hour session for a massage, spa, facial, and whatever else they do. I got the nicest package they have.

Well, I knew my son had a game, but I didn't realize how late it was going to run. So she started to go on about how now she has to rush to get to my mom on time, and she probably won't even enjoy the spa because she's going to be annoyed.

Okay. Fine, I guess. I tell her it'll be okay. She won't be close to being late for the appointment, and I'll let my mom know she might be running late. My mom wouldn't, and didn't mind. 

She then calls me to ask me why I didn't tell her where my mom was taking the kids. She was taking them to my sisters friends party. I said I didn't think it was important. They're only going to be there for an hour, and I didn't think it would be an issue. She started going off about how now she has to bathe the kids again, and I always plan things poorly, and I should have told her everything.

Admittedly, I should have thought about how long his game might be. My kids are always bathed tho. They're not gross, or anything. Also, if your kid is in baseball they're expected to be dirty after a game? He's five. He's supposed to be dirty. My mom isn't trying to impress these people, and we don't even know them. My mom doesn't even want to be there, but she doesn't want them to not come to my sisters thing.

Anyway, getting off topic. I'll shorten this up. I said she needs to just relax, and it'll be fine. She kept going off. I also admittedly got shitty at this point, and said I just shouldn't have bothered, I guess. Or something along those lines. She hung up, and texted me to just cancel the appointment.

1395,"AITA for not being there for my friend? Edit: people keep saying I should not have gone to the party if I knew I had the bridal fair the next day. I wasn't sure if I would be able to go the next day, and Becky and I decided together to go to the party that night before. Like texting back and forth to make sure the other was going so that we could share an uber back together because we knew we would be drinking. At the party, Becky again asked me to go and I agreed while drunk on the toilet. I had only said maybe before, if my work called me off that night. I usually sleep during the day because I have to be up from 7pm-7am for my job. I cant just sleep the night before and stay up all day and then remain up all night. I have to get sleep beforehand. 

So, my best friend is getting married in 10 months. Let's call her Becky. I'm her maid of honor. Its exciting and I'm really happy for her. I've never been a maid of honor before though. I'm struggling with this situation so far:

So Becky has already picked out her dress and decided on bridesmaid dresses. We spent an entire day shopping in a city an hour away and deciding on these things. 

Since then, she has invited the other bridesmaids and I to go to 2 events with her. The first was a florist visit last month so she could decide on the kind of flowers she wanted for the wedding. I originally said yes I would go, but then she had to change the date of the appointment to a day where I had to work. So I didnt go. 

The second event was yesterday. 3 days prior she had told me and other bridesmaids about this bridal fair she wanted to go to, and asked if we could go. I told her I would have to see how things went because I worked that evening. The event would basically take most of my sleeping time. But whatever. 

Saturday night comes along and Becky and I both get invited out to a birthday party of a mutual friend that night. We both had off, and we would see some good friends which included the other bridesmaids, so we all went. Everyone got wasted, most people not making it home before vomiting. I had a good time, things felt good. At the party, Becky asked me again if I would go to the bridal fair the next morning. She begged, saying only a couple of other older family members were going with her. Drunk me felt like Superwoman, so I said sure. Everyone got drunk af and went home. 

I went home at 2am, woke up at 5am with a splitting headache and a shit ton of stomach pain. I took ibuprofen and tried to get comfortable enough to sleep. No go. I chugged water. Still felt like shit. Now its 8am and I am extremely nauseous. I hadn't drank alcohol since 1am, I thought I had escaped nausea. My boyfriend was really worried I had something else going on because of the amount of pain I was in, and wanted me to go to the hospital, but I'm in the medical field so I felt like I knew when I would need to go to the doctor. I couldnt sleep still. It was 9:30am. The bridal fair was supposed to be at 11. I texted Becky to tell her I wasnt going to be able to go. I felt like complete crap. I apologized. 

I finally vomited, passed gas, and the stomach pains/nausea started to fade. It was 11:30. Becky had opened my message but not responded. I finally was able to fall asleep. At 1pm I woke up to a message from Becky, saying she was extremely disappointed in the fact that I wasnt there for her with the wedding planning. She said I never went to events with her and she would just have to learn to ""lean on"" someone else instead of me. 

I'm like...what? I spent a day with her picking out dresses. I am actively planning an expensive bachelorette party because she wants a destination one. I feel like I'm doing what I'm supposed to do. It has just been shitty timing for the other stuff. I told Becky this, she said it doesnt change the fact that I've let her down and been a disappointment to her. She then went on to say she doesnt accept my reasons for not going to the bridal fair (extreme nausea and pain). She said every other bridesmaid had messaged her the same thing and she expected more. 

I just... I don't know. In my family, you did not have the maid of honor or bridesmaids do shit like this. They help with bachelorette parties and stuff like that. It's just weird to me that Becky seems to expect this much of me and the other bridesmaids. Is this normal though? Am I being an asshole?

1402,"AITA for leaving my fiancée while she was in rehab? First time posting to Reddit, this is eating my soul and I need opinions. 

Back story: 

I was with my fiancee for 2 years (living together) and things were really great until the last few months we were together. I've never fallen so hard for someone or loved a woman this much, we clicked on every level. She started getting really depressed and sleeping a lot the last few months and I figured it was a phase because she hated her job and had some shitty life stuff going on. Once in the last weeks she started crying (she never, ever cries) and said she wished she was dead, stressed that she didn't want to kill herself and never would, just that she wished she was dead. I hugged her and suggested going to the gym would get her out of her funk, but really I didn't know how to handle it other than that and regrettably kind of just backed away and started to distance myself. The last day I saw her she was on the couch kind of staring into space and said ""If I'm not here when you get home today, it's because I left to get help. I need help"". I assumed she meant for the depression or other health stuff because she had basically stopped eating and had a lot of stomach and sleep problems so I didn't think much of it- she would make an appt with a Dr and be back later in the evening or whatever. 

&#x200B;

Three times over the past 6-8 months she also snapped on me out of nowhere at night, said some hurtful things and told me to ""get the fuck out"". Within minutes she would be loving again and forget she had said anything at all, and in the mornings she had zero recollection of these events. She apologized profusely and told me she had taken Ambien and that it makes people say crazy/aggressive things that they don't mean, but I feel like on some level she meant them and Ambien just revealed how she really felt. Every other minute of every day save for those 3 incidents, she was kind, supportive, loving... all around great. But those 3 times eat at me sometimes.

I was not aware that she began drinking in those last months. She had never been a big drinker, she disliked bars, didn't like the taste of most alcohol. I don't know if the depression led to her drinking, or drinking caused the depression or what. But it was some hardcore alcoholic behavior like buying bottles of vodka and drinking them alone at night after I went to bed. I had **NO** idea. She's a really intelligent girl and this was some upper-level evil genius type ability to hide her problem. 

&#x200B;

So I come home from running errands and she is gone. No big deal, figure she'll be back in a few hours. It turns to night and I begin to worry. I start looking through the house to see if she packed an overnight bag and that's when I find an empty bottle of vodka in one of her drawers and an empty Smirnoff Ice (lol) bottle under the bed. I am fucking pissed because I know she's not a big drinker, so she must have had people over and drank with them. I assume a guy, one of her male friends is an alcoholic and I've always been suspicious of him. Not for any real reason, I just thought of him first and got angry and started packing a bag for ME to leave but decide to stay the night in our house after all. The next morning I get a call from a rehab center saying that my girlfriend checked herself in the previous afternoon and they took her cell phone, she was so bad off they brought her to the nearest hospital to detox because they were worried about seizures blah blah blah. She is going back to the rehab center after that for a 30 day treatment and she will call me when she's physically able but that ""she wants me to know she loves me and is so sorry and realized she had a problem and needed to leave right then to get help before she changed her mind"". Whatever. 

&#x200B;

So I am fucking floored... but some of the stuff from the last few months makes sense now and at least I know she wasn't fucking around on me. She's just a closet alcoholic (just, haha). It is such a huge betrayal of trust that I snap and make plans to move out. Get an apartment across town, move out, refuse all her calls from rehab, I'm fucking done with her. Let her come home to an empty house and see how it feels. 

&#x200B;

Then I start to regret my decision because who leaves the love of their life while they're in rehab, when they recognized they had a problem and got help?? I can't break my new lease (well maybe I could have but I didn't want to, still angry and confused) but I decide to visit her a few days before she gets out of rehab to tell her I had broken up with her and moved out, because letting her come home to an empty house with no warning was a dick move. She cried a ton and explained what led her to where she was, asked to work on things, etc. Which I considered because I really love this girl and to be honest I'm still considering it 4 months later. But I've only seen her in person a few times since then (2 hour long talks twice and once we just hung out) and have kind of cut contact save for cordial texts. She's doing well and staying sober, she's always been pretty strong and independent and I honestly believe the alcohol thing was a fluke tied to depression and she will be OK on the not drinking thing in the future, but she lost her job and can't afford the old house on her own so she's now unemployed and broke (rehab is expensive, yo). I feel badly about not being there for her for all of this and might want her back one day but the trust is just *destroyed*. And I feel so guilty about leaving her while she was in rehab/after she got out instead of being supportive but for fucks sake I would have been all that if she TOLD ME SHE HAD A PROBLEM instead of simply disappearing one day. 

&#x200B;

Just need some opinions on whether I'm the asshole here or nah. 

&#x200B;

I got a little bit heartbroken knowing he didn’t die happy (I thought he might be a little bit depressed since before he died he would answer questions unmotivated like) and here comes the sticky part.

My grandma got engaged to my grandpa before he got handicapped in the war. He was severely handicapped. (Nothing mental, just couldn’t use his mouth properly and say words so we had try to guess what he was trying to say and his hands and legs were handicapped.) My grandma spent a lot of time taking care of grandpa so I felt like sometimes she was unhappy.

Basically we are on night 5 one of a 3 week road trip, we have camped in all previous stops. I’m the only girl traveling with 3 guys who I know from classes. All are cool and it’s somthing I’ve wanted to do for a long time. To be totally fair and up front I didn’t do shit to put this trip together. I didn’t make reservations, drive or buy any tickets and it’s not my car. All I did was show up with my pretty little face and Venmo app to make sure I paid my way.

Bedroom has a queen bed. When we arrived, one guy hopped in the shower, the other two went to find some Coke. So I unloaded all my stuff in bedroom. The guy got out of the shower and sort of chuckled “typical girl, whatever” and took the twin bed.

This lecturer told all of his classes in the beginning of the year that everyone is responsible for writing 10 separate responses to our topic of studies for the entire year, 5 responses are due by the end of the first semester and the rest are due at the end of the second semester but you can hand them in anytime before their deadlines. Well, the first semester is coming to an end. And Z decided to save all of her responses for the end if this semester. Our lecturer has a rule that we can only hand in one response in a week. That means that if you dont start writing your responses early, you will have to submit one every week in the last five weeks of the semester. You cant email him or send him the response; it has to printed out. 

Well Z decided that because she wont be able to attend his lecture this week, she will give her response to me to hand in. Basically, she wants me to print out her response and give it to our lecturer.

Now I dont want to sound petty (although I probably am). If it had been any of my close friends I would not mind because I know that they all do their work themselves and dont normally ask for help or favors from others. But because this isnt Z’s first time asking me to go out of my way to help her despite us not being close friends, I dont want to do her work again, especially since she is never able to help me out whenever I ask.

1420,"AITA for overlapping romantic relationships? **TL;DR The end of my last relationship overlapped with the beginning of my current relationship. Girlfriend wasn't happy about it.**

I got into a dispute with my girlfriend 'May' a few days ago. I apologized and things seem to be fine now, but I still am left with a feeling of uneasiness about the whole thing.

She learned that I was still in a relationship with my previous girlfriend 'April' while I was beginning to see her. Some important points:

1) My relationship with April was in its death throes. By this point, she and I were seeing other people and kind of deciding for ourselves if our relationship was worth salvaging. April and I were both aware that we were seeing other people and were ready to accept the relationship ending if one of us wanted to.

2) Meeting May was a chance encounter. There is a strong likelihood that I never would have seen her again had I not set the ball rolling then and there.

3) I officially broke things off with April before my third date with May. May and I were officially a thing by the end of our fourth date.

4) April and I kept contact during this time, but she and I did not at any point meet nor did either of us have the intention to.

From May's point of view:

1) I was obligated to let May know that I was seeing someone else. April and I not seeing each other notwithstanding, the mere fact that April and I were still a ""thing"" was pertinent information.

2) In not telling May that I was seeing someone else, I was depriving her of the freedom that I had to see others. Even though May and I were not officially exclusive, there *is* an expectation that we *were* unless otherwise explicitly stated.

3) The way I handled things made May feel that I was ""giving her a test drive"" and holding onto April as a safety net if things didn't work out.

My thoughts:

1) I don't think May would've agreed to go on a date had she known that I was still somewhat together with April. Besides, I didn't think it would be pertinent information until she and I were seriously considering a relationship. Up until that point, both May and I were effectively single and eligible. It wouldn't have bothered me if she went on dates with other guys before we became a couple. I don't feel like I deprived her of anything more than the info itself.

2) I definitely did not see my dates with May as a test drive. I took the relationship seriously from date #1. That I was together with April is merely a formality.

In the end, I apologized to May. It's clear that whatever I did bothered her so I assured her that she could trust me. It seems to have made her feel better, and I'm glad.

But I can't help but wonder. Am I the asshole for overlapping relationships? If so, would there have been a way for me to not be the asshole *and* still date May?

I've been supporting my boyfriend for the past year while he's been going through some rough patches in life (death of a relative, struggling with rejections for a job in a competitive field, etc.).

I've been missing out on some of his family events because of work or because I'm just too tired to attend after working 12+ hrs a day.

I've noticed my future MIL not liking me as much as she used to, presumably because of my frequent absence. It hurts because I've been supporting her son both financially and emotionally while she has done practically nothing, while preaching that she's always here for her son.

My parents have taken in my boyfriend as their own son, allowing us to originally live at my mom's when boyfriend couldn't afford rent at his OWN parents house which they wouldn't waive for him (we have since moved out to our own apt).

His parents gave us money for Christmas, which I'm extremely grateful for, as I wasn't even expecting to be gifted anything. Every Christmas, they always give us differenting amounts though, with boyfriend's card having hearts drawn all over the card, and mine blank.

But he didn’t had it hard, his parents are very progressive and he never had to hide it, he never had to hide his partners to other people because they were judgmental.

1442,"AITA for admitting to my parents the worsening actions of my brother? Hi,

So my brother is only 15.  Almost 16 in November.  He used to be extremely well mannered and cared deeply about his academics and for other people.

About a year ago, he started to hang out with a crowd that didn’t suit him.  I’ve ignored some of his actions because it’s not major and it is a dick move to report to my parents like a hall monitor such as him trying to vape and whatnot (even though I wouldn’t encourage it).

As the year progressed, he has turned into a dick to me, my parents, and he claims he has anxiety whenever he’s around my parents— and I know now because he’s been hiding lots of things.  He’s just not the brother I’ve known.  I’ve tried pursuing interests that he likes and that I even don’t, but he’s like a ticking time bomb.

Well, I’ve found out something horrible.  My parents have been paying to take him to movie theaters with his “friends” with their own money almost every week, even after acknowledging he’s in the wrong group to let him have some freedom as a teenager— unknowingly knowing half of the other stuff he does.  Our family is even in a very tight financial situation, so they’re honestly doing this as a way for him to hangout with his friends.

Forget about his friends.  They aren’t there.  He’s been literally making out with girls secretly and I found out from one of the girls he kissed (not made out with, but kissed once).  It’s one thing to make out with one girl, but to abuse my parents’ money just to see multiple girls is unhealthy with a growing view of relationships.

Doesn’t stop there, there are some things that one girl can’t even tell me.  About 5 about what he’s done.  Which tells me that conditions are severely worsening.  Who knows if he’s had sex or even tried severe drugs at this age... and note that this community is mainly clean and well-managed with not a lot of bad areas so that is saying something.  He’s literally 15 with a voice that hasn’t even truly deepened and doing all of this crazy shit.

Out of fear and concern I told my parents.  They didn’t go crazy on him at all.  They had a civil discussion of how it’s inappropriate and punished him.  I tried to remain anonymous but he found out it was me who told and hasn’t spoke to me since.  I wouldn’t do it to him if he would’ve gotten in major trouble and I toned down what I admitted (I.e. I said 1 girl instead of multiple).

AITA for notifying my parents to stay aware of his behaviors for the sake of his future actions and perspectives?  I really don’t want to see him lost and depressed in the future, but I don’t want to be a hall monitor on him.

He’s just been very off this year and everyone is really concerned about his behavior, like very.  He’s hiding a lot of stuff and we don’t even know if he could be having sex (especially unprotected) and heavy drugs.

I do admit that I freaked out a little too much on this specific scenario, but I’m just scared and I do feel like the asshole even though it wasn’t intended. 

EDIT:  I literally completely forgot to mention that when the girl told me this stuff, she showed me the stuff he’s sent to her through Snapchat without screenshots and when I was sitting next to her.

1444,"AITA because I called a lady out for gloating? So I'm subscribed to this group that helps with testing in a particular subject and it's kind of a communal - offering advice, ask for support taking them, make jokes etc and the moderator for the group made a post pretty much saying, ""why you shouldn't take X test first"" with like a video and commentary.

Well a lady responds saying, ""Well I took it first and passed it on my first go *shrug emoji*"" and I responded that anecdotal evidence does not mean it's the same for everyone. She then responds that she was ""just sharing my experience. Not implying everyone would have the same results!""

So from there I went on to explain to her she sounded more like she was gloating and that her response wasn't helpful. The other people responding were commenting things like - oh I totally agree because blah, or this helped me cause blah, and I just felt like her response was really dickish. I told her pretty much congrats and that's great, however that's not really helpful for this thread because other people are dissuaded from taking these tests after failing this one since it's kind of the oddball of the group and simply stating you passed it your first really doesn't give anyone advice on how that went for you.

They don't have birthday at the same date. So I didn't choose one over the other. My GF had her birthday 3 months ago and my ex had her's last weekend. I have been together with my ex for almost ten years and am happy that we found a way to become friends after the breakup. My GF seems to be ok with that and she also knew I would be there. So no secrets here.

Me and my GF are in a long distance relationship for almost a year now. Althought flights are pretty cheap (about 20$ to 30$ one way), it takes about 1 hour of flight and another 2 hours by train to get there. When she had her birthday, we just had seen each other 10 days before and I thought she didn't care so much about her birthday, so I didn't even consider it. She hadn't invited me either, so I didn't think it would matter to her. But as the day came, her friends seemed to have asked why I wasn't there and that got her thinking. She told me after, that she felt bad not being able to tell those people why I wasn't there and she felt embarassed. I understand that, but thought, it would be ok between us. When she asked me, why I hadn't been there, I answered that I simply thought, she didn't care. That made her angry.

Three months on, the week before the birthday of my ex, we got into an argument and I chose to have some time for myself for the weekend. I went to the birthday from my ex and all was nice and relaxed and I enjoyed talking to the people. I barely spoke to my ex, so I don't see why she is now angry at me. It was a nice weekend and I wrote to my GF after. I didn't write for three days (she was texting me a bit during this time), but I felt I needed this time and I told her about it.

There was this girl I went out with uhh like 7 times? And she was okay, but I couldn’t see being her girlfriend. She sent me a text like every day and I was getting kind of tired of it. I wanted to reject her but she was nice enough and we weren’t official so I thought I’d do it in a nice way.

I told her I was having a rough week and attempted su*cide (censored for trigger) and couldn’t go on dates for 8 weeks because I was on suicide watch. She was all oh my god are you okay and saying no no it’s okay health is #1 and I was saying thank you, she said she was there if I needed anything and I thought ok, this is where it ends. 

But she kept messaging me almost every day, except now more stuff like “I hope today’s not too bad” and “how are you?” stuff. And she would send memes. I started conversations every now and then too but not as much. I even posted some depressing stuff and told her I just didn’t want her to feel responsible if I made another attempt. 

Then she asks me if I’m busy over the weekend and I’m like wtf, I already said I was on suicide watch. So I go “oh I don’t know which day I’m free because I’m going camping with my family” hoping she’s gonna get the hint. And she says oh okay, that sounds fun and I go “maybe you can come” but like in a vague way, she says sure just let me know which day soon so I can figure out my weekend. I never told her the day or talked about the “trip” and hoped she’d forget about it. 

I try being more distant and it’s not working because she keeps worrying about me. Eventually she says she’s gonna give me space and promises she still likes me and is here for me, and I don’t respond. Then she calls me. And double texts. And triple texts saying “that’s alright, maybe I misunderstood, good luck with everything and cya”. I felt bad so I said I don’t know about my health and after a while stopped responding to her. 

She texts me again, in barely like a week, asking if we could be friends and how I’m feeling. I say I’m better and she’s like “wow awesome!” and I don’t respond. But my read receipts are on and even when I ignore her sometimes she double texts me. She asks me to hang out again and I say my schedule is so crazy for the next three months I don’t know (which obviously doesn’t go with the suicide watch thing... but she doesn’t get it) and she’s like you know, I really meant what I told you and really thought we were friends, and I don’t know what it is on your end, which sucks. 

I felt bad and kept saying no I’m just busy but she said “then tell me when you figure it out” and I didn’t answer. She finally left me alone.

1456,"AITA for finding it unacceptable for an associate to look like a teenager at a very high end retail store. Throwaway because I’ve posted on mens fashion subs and don’t want to get recognized.

There is a 19 year old female at our very high-retail store. I won’t disclose details, but she essentially got this job due to nepotism. We demand multiple years of high-end retail experience, while she has none.

She’s always doing wild and childish things to her hair. She’ll put it in two very high-puffs and do crazy things with her baby hairs. She once spent a week wearing her hair in 4 braids with these ball things because her mom showed her a picture of someone named brat. To top it off, she’ll put in clips, barrettes, colourful elastics.

We don’t have a policy against hair accessories or the hairstyles she wears but it’s a rule that shouldn’t be written. She should know that at her age. You can’t look like a teenager when you represent our store. This isn’t forever 21. She hasn’t violated any actual policies yet, but I believe she’s finding loopholes.

This affects how the customers interact with her. We have older clients. They either infantilize her or avoid her all together. She does not present herself as being capable of doing her job, and they do not perceive her such. The guests who don't  avoid her, are older women who say she looks precious, but never ask for her assistance.

This affects my job as well, I'm supposed to give her feedback on her performance, but I rarely see her perform.  I have limited feedback and it reflects poorly on my ability to do my job. When people do not ask her for assistance, this makes work harder for other employees. Why have more people on shift if they are still doing extra work.

I tried to address this at our lead meeting. One member of our team accused me of being racist and “adultifying her”. I’m aware of adultifiation but it doesn’t apply to other adults. He still insists that her race forces me to see as much older and I’m faulting someone for “not looking 25, when they aren’t 25”.

Then he accused me of only policing African textured hair.

This has nothing to do with race. But the equivalent of two high-puffs is two ponytails, which would be unacceptable. Im a man with long hair and if showed up with my babyhairs swirled all over, id look ridiculous. No one else does this but her. He completely ignored me and insists I’m uncomfortable with her blackness.

We didn’t discuss it further and won’t because of a potential HR case. However, after the meeting, some of team members approached and agreed with me. The accusation of racism was unwarranted and career damaging.

So my coworker Jay & I are pretty much as different as can be. We wouldn't get along as friends, but as co-workers we got to be pretty friendly with one another, enough to the point that when her bf broke up with her, I let her know I was there for her. I live 4 miles away and have to walk to work, & since we get let out around 11 at the earliest, my bf sticks around to walk me home. This night was one of those. I was working with Jay, and bf was in the back waiting for me to be done. I know it's unprofessional, but other people have done the same thing so I didn't feel that it was inappropriate.

Jay and I are both shift leads, & it was her on shift lead duty, so she was in the office writing the end of day email. The email doesn't take more than 10 minutes most of the time, but she was in there for 30 mins working on it. I was peeved that I was stuck doing a lot of the closing stuff myself, but not a huge deal. When she finally comes out and sees me give my bf a kiss, she says ""Okay OP, it's 11 o'clock so we have to actually be WORKING now."" Considering how long she was sitting in the office I felt very insulted to be accused of not working because I paused for a second to kiss my bf.

A week later I'm working with my manager & she tells me that she got an email about me having my bf stay during closing and that it's a huge distraction to everyone. She says I can't have him here anymore and that my hours for that week are gonna be cut. I know Jay sent the email. Keep in mind that this is only the second time I've ever had him stay, so the fact that she seemed to present it as if it were an ongoing issue is pretty unjustified to me. I'm livid that she would go behind my back and email our manager about it when she could've just told me her issues. But, ultimately, it is unprofessional behavior and she isn't in the wrong for thinking so. I decided to just let it go and move on, but no longer be amicable with her.

Next week, I find out that she said she wants to do something to get me fired. I decide to confront her directly about it in hopes of resolving it ourselves. I text her saying I don't appreciate hearing about the things she's been saying, & that if she ever has a problem with me to tell me. She says I've never been respectful towards her, my work ethic is horrible, & I'm constantly slacking off and everyone else has to pick up the slack.

1463,"AITA for wanting to drink again? 2 years ago, my SO and I had this massive implosion on our 2 year anniversary (so we've been together 4 years total). Due to my shitty upbringing, I have gnarly trust issues, and he proposed to me in front of a big group of people WITH a photographer. Due to the immense pressure, I said yes, faked smiles for pics, then told him no later. We hadn't discussed marriage at ALL. Ever. On top of that, the entire trip I felt like I wasn't being heard, and like what I had to say didn't matter, he'd do what he wanted anyway. It felt like small red flag after red flag.

We were doing long distance at the time, and during my short visit we weren't able to fully work things out and I had to finish up my internship feeling like I was losing my mind. Normally he makes sure I'm 110% comfortable before we make any new step together, big or small. And I was terrified that I had just discovered the ""real him,"" and that the man I had fallen deeply in love with was hiding a manipulative, controlling side.

So what did I do?

I drank. I went to clubs for the first time. I drank even more, getting completely drunk for the first, second, and third time. I made out with random people at those clubs. I felt so lost, confused, and hurt, and like I had to keep pretending that he hadn't just hurt me so badly, just so I could push through another day.

But I made out with random people while drunk.

When I got back, it took me a few months, but I finally confessed to him. And that was what really almost destroyed us. He'd been cheated on in the past, and he viewed this as exactly the same. I hadn't even really seen it as cheating, but he was right: I didn't stop getting drunk after the first night I made out with a stranger.

Two years later, we've been able to work nearly everything out. He's gone to therapy, I've gone to therapy. He's on meds, I'm on meds. And I'm two years sober. We moved in together, and we're the happiest we could be. We really, truly are. He is the love of my life and I would do anything for him, and I know he would do the same for me. He is so sweet, caring, and kind. He makes sure I always feel safe, especially since I grew up in a shitty environment. And I try to do the same for him.

My younger brother just turned 21. He used to be Mormon like the rest of our family, but recently is no longer. I think it would be so special for me to share his first drink with him, especially as incredibly close siblings who've been through the same shit.

I expressed this to my SO, and he said he's still uncomfortable with me drinking. It's been two years of growth for us, but I'm clearly more comfortable with the idea of me drinking again.

1466,"WIBTA if I skipped a class when my group needs me for a project? So, I’m in an acting school. In my film class, we have a project coming up where we have to write, storyboard, and direct and star in our own scenes. The final draft of our script is due tomorrow, and it is not even close to being done. Even though it is one scene, every shot and cut needs to be marked. I would be up all night doing it.

The thing is, I have a group chat with my group. Only 1 of the 2 other people in it even responds to me when I ask questions about work. The last person (we are in a group of 5, including myself) didn’t want to be in the group chat for personal reasons, and is hard to get ahold of. In class, only me and this other person spouted ideas, and when we started writing, only me and this other person were contributing. Two of the remaining 3 were high, and the last person just didn’t feel like working. 

I’m debating skipping, because I’ve been that person who takes on the brunt of the work when group members are slacking before, and I’m done. I’m not gonna stress out about it anymore. (This is our last class before Xmas break, so I will have time to work on it at my own pace if I have to). The only issue is, that this other member who was ACTUALLY contributing might get fucked over. But I can’t get ahold of that person, and I just simply am not going to be the only person writing this entire thing tonight. I don’t want to be an ass to them, because they’re nice people, they just don’t work. So I thought just skipping that class might be a better option than showing up and being blunt with the teacher about it. 

So, If I skip I might fuck over the one person who actually was working with me. But if I go, and the teacher asks why the assignment isn’t done, I would be blunt and explain the situation to him, which might cause tension in the group. Would I be the asshole if I skipped?

I have an antique slot machine from the 1940s that is in absolutely spotless and working condition in my living room. My step grandma was a show girl she she got it while dating a count room guy prior to meeting my grandpa.

Over the years people have played it and maybe won a few quarters here and there. Maybe a max of $50 at a time. As far as I know the jackpot was never hit on it so however it works there was probably about $700 in the jackpot reserve that had built up over the years. I’d never bothered to have it cleaned out since it just seemed like a fun novelty. 

Well a friend’s friend hit the jackpot last night. I was fucking floored when he legit thought he could keep my ~$700. His case was hed been playing with his own money and I would have kept his quarters. My argument  was I’d be happy to give him his quarters back if he’d asked but I’m not a casino and while I’m not destitute, I can’t afford to give someone $700. Argument caused the party to wind down and one of my best guy friends basically told the guy he’d be in real shit if he tried to leave with the money but the guy left threatening to come back with the cops and sue me in small claims court. I have no idea if that was realistic but no cops came back. 

So was I the asshole for nor letting him keep the money?

Edit4: well I was banned for joking around, other people have bad posts calling me a cunt up for over an hour.  Makes INFO hard but I’ll try to explain my thinking on the money in the machine and why I can’t “afford” to give it to him. 

Say you have a change jar, has $100 in it. Your good friend asks to borrow $25, for parking, you'd say yes right? Another friend says wow, that’s cool I have $1.25 in my pocket, can I donate to your change jar? You’d say yes. Now let’s say a guy you’ve never met says “hey I just put .80 into your change jar, now I’m taking the whole thing.” You would say no. It’s how I’ve always seen the slot machine as huge change jar for all my close friends to use. I’ve given people quarters to play, I’ve taken a quarter here and there from people who wanted to see it work. I’ve taken in maybe $100 over five years. Maybe. That’s a nickel a day. that’s not a freaking illegal gambling operation.


Edit5: a good question:

>INFO Did he explicitly ask if he was allowed to play it, and keep what he wins? If no then he played it without permission, you aren't running a casino.

No he did not, the first time I ever saw or spoke to him was when he was on his hands and knees picking quarters up off the floor slamming them his pockets.  I don't mind if people play it, I even give people quarters to play it (since no one has change anymore) but he did not ask.

Edit6: another good question

>Also, need more info. You stated that other guests have won small jackpots in the past (max $50). Did you let them keep it? If so, why are you making a double-standard here?


I would have let him keep $50-100 (he certainly got away with some in his pockets) but he was such an asshole right away that he didn't give me the chance to come to any sort of deal. Most everyone at the party just wanted him gone. I do feel bad and maybe my guilt over the apparent double standard is why I'm asking here. But I do feel as though had he been even slightly cool and not threaten cops or lawsuits I wouldn't have been backed into a corner.

Edit7: 

>INFO
We need to know where the money came from. Did the money in the machine come from YOU putting it in or playing the machine

So this is all guess work based on what my grandma said the jackpot could hold (there's a window that shows the coins in rhe jackpot, the space behind is about the size of a big shoe box). She said it gets full at $800. It was more than half when she and my grandpa gave it to me, I always guessed $500. In five years it's now 7/8ths full. I play it from to time to time so I'd say $100 of that is mine and $100 is friends. I think the jackpot and normal pay outs come from different boxes so last night was the last night I've ever seen that window empty. I know nothing of the machine or how it works or how to change settings so I may be so wrong and a slot machine ""nerd"" could correct me if I'm way off base.



> I really hope you get into some serious legal trouble and then you’ll wish all you lost was several hundred and not thousands including jail time.



1. I wasn't profiting off this machine. I've literally never opened it up and taken a single coin out.

2. I can't afford to give a random dude $700. I don't need it now, but I have savings account I don't need it now either but I might some day. And now I've found out that some of the quarters that my grandma had from the 50s or 60s might actually be silver. So good thing I hung onto them right ? (I can't wait for the ""you're a stupid thot"" rationalizations to come from this one). 

3. I never cleaned it out because honestly I like the way it looked with the coins in the window. This thing is enourmous and built with casino security in mind so it was in fact, a great piggy bank. 

4. Some nice NTAs have suggested I have a bowl of quarters a for people to play. I actually in effect did that because 80% the time people who wanted to play didn't have change (I got it five years ago) so I always had quarters around, maybe just not right by the machine. 

5. As an example, Over the years it's mostly friends kids who want to play. I had a very precocious 9 year old once come over with his $20 of money truly expecting to get the jackpot. He was heartbroken when he didn't win (I might have given it to him since he was so cute) but I gave him a $20 silver certificate my step grandma had given me (acquired ny dubious means no doubt) and that kid was thrilled. so I always, always give people money back if they ask. I never intended to profit off the machine. No one has ever made a big deal of it before (save the 9 year old).

1471,"AITA for turning off my phone and taking a road trip without telling my family? I am a 25 year old recovering addict who is a year and 3 months clean from heroin. 

My addiction got so bad that at one point I ended up in the hospital after an overdose waking up with my mom telling me that she would no longer watch her own son die in front of her and my family would no longer have any contact with me until I was at least a year clean. 

After a lot of struggles, including a relapse, I reached a year clean and reached out to my family. They tentatively agreed to establish contact with me and now call me semi regularly to check up on me. 

Since getting a pretty decent job a few months ago, I finally felt financially stable enough to afford a car. 

Last week after leaving work, I felt spontaneous and decided to go on a road trip out of the city since I had a few days off coming up. 

I rented a hotel room, grabbed my dog, and spent a couple days hiking and spending time in nature by myself. I turned my phone off as well because when I go hiking I like to really disconnect and I wanted to spend the entire weekend disconnected from the internet and just be with my own thoughts and my dog. I find this has been really beneficial to my sobriety. 

I didn’t even think of telling anyone as I live alone and am a fully grown adult, so why should I have to? 

When I finally turned my phone on, on my way home, I received hundreds of text messages and calls from both my parents and my older sister. 

They started out with just a request to call them back but then went on with being concerned about my whereabouts, to saying things like “We are worried and we don’t care if you relapsed, we just want to know that you are okay.” To phone messages from my sister crying that she is worried about me. 

When I got home I called all of them and explained where I was and what I was doing but they were so upset with me and started yelling that I caused them so much pain and that I should tell them where I’m going before I do these things and that they all thought I was dead somewhere. They said it reminded them of when I was using and would disappear for weeks on end. 

I told them that while I get they were worried, I am also an adult and I shouldn’t have to tell them my every move, especially when I’ve been clean and responsible. 

They continued to get upset with me and when I called my sister she straight up called me an asshole and said that she thought my mom was going to have a heart attack worrying about where I was. She said that there are different rules for “people like me”. 

I haven’t apologized for not telling them I was leaving the city and I don’t think I really need to. I’m an adult and I can’t always tell them where I’m going. I get that they might be worried but there also needs to be boundaries.

This is something I think about a lot lately but the short version is that I only allow a couple people my girlfriend knows to come over and I hangout with new friends of hers at least once (usually movies or to smoke some weed, not like an interview or anything) before new ones have permission to come over. This started early into our relationship but we've been together five years now and live together. My girlfriend never brings it up and when I've asked her about it she says she doesn't mind but she's also fairly submissive due to her upbringing (this could be its own story so I'll skip it for now) and I often worry about taking advantage of her nature.  


For context, this is the only relationship I've ever done this in. When it first started it was because my girlfriend has friends who imo could be problematic to have around and I have a home business. The gallery includes an alcoholic who up until a few months ago would pee randomly at parties, two guys I /know/ are engaging in non-violent/non-theft felonious activities (I don't want to go into details here but this isn't just a hunch, from her stories I recognize the activity the pair are engaging in), a guy who got out of the navy (not a problem) and spends most of his time saying obscene things to women because he never reintegrated into regular life (the problem), and another guy who screamed at her while she was weezing on the ground from a panic attack once. There's also two girls who are newer and sort've obnoxious but seem alright truthfully. I've been thinking of saying it'd be alright if the pair of girls came over but all of these people are part of the same circle and I'm worried about them inviting the rest of the gang (their friend circle is very ""if x is here then the whole gang should be here"")

**Context:** I've\[27F\] been in a relationship with a woman \[27\] for four years, known her for nine. My mother doesn't approve of our relationship for... some reason, I have no idea why. She used to like my wife, then she started to ignore her existence (as in, wouldn't answer to me when I mentioned her), get snippy if I was on the phone with her, all that. I told her we got engaged, and she gave me the flattest ""oh"" before continuing with a ""well, if you're sure, I just want to make sure she won't drag you down"" (just to be clear; that would be rude nonetheless, but my wife is a postgrad at one of the best universities of her country, so I literally have no idea what she means there) and then ""but congratulations, I guess"". She then went on to never ask about it again, until I mentioned our engagement again a year later and she revealed that she thought I was just joking (???) and ""congratulations, I guess,"" with a touch of ""oh, you're thinking of a small wedding? I did the same, and look at how that went"" (her and my father are divorced).

So, yeah, not on board.

Anyway, my then–fiancée is currently living outside the country. Our plan was to have her move here and *then* get married, but immigration was basically impossible for her unless we were already married. Following the advice of an immigration lawyer, we had a small ceremony a couple of months ago.

My mother knows nothing of this.

Part of the reason why she doesn't is because, well, she doesn't care. As said before, talking about my wife means my mother changes the subject, and honestly, I just couldn't deal with that negativity.

The main reason why I haven't told her already, however, is that I just found out that, years ago, my mother did a minor fuck up with my finances. I'll try to remain vague, but it's nothing that impacts my credit, thankfully, and she didn't steal money from me. It's still something that gave me a heart attack when I found out, though. So I asked my mother just what, exactly, was she thinking when she did  what she did, and her answer was ""I'll tell you in person next weekend"".

That weekend was three months ago, just before I married my wife. She hasn't answered my texts or call since.

**The Situation Now;** Next week, my family will meet up to celebrate my grandma's birthday. My mom *should* be there, but who knows, she doesn't answer my texts.

I haven't told anyone in my family that I got married, mostly because I knew that if I did, my mother would throw a hissy fit because *they* knew before *her*.

So my question is; ***WIBTA if I told my family I'm married at my grandmother's birthday?***

Also, it was in the country my wife is living in right now, and I didn't want to imply that they had to buy a ticket to another continent with so little notice.

>We didn't tell them we got married because 1) we're not a very close family, 2) I haven't told my mother yet, and of course texting is not good enough for her for this kind of news, and of course she'd be offended if everybody else in the family knew before her, 3) because of the previous point, I didn't want to put anyone in the position of having to lie to my mother, or have them deal with my mother's reaction in case they were the ones who accidentally broke the news to her first.

I'll try to keep this brief.

I had a big fight with my partner over letting her little sister live rent and bill free with us for 2/3 nights a week every week.

Back story is that rent is expensive where I live and I pay 60% as I earn quite a bit more than my SO.

It's a small 2 bed place and having my own space is important to me.  The second bedroom acts as an office / wardrobe / guest bedroom.

My SOs little sister works in the city we live in and stays with us several nights a week without contributing anything towards our expenses even though she earns reasonably well.

She's also particularly useless when she stays over in that she never cooks or cleans and creates work for us because we have to clean her sheets for other guests and tidy up after her in general.

This drives me crazy as I can't help but feel like I'm being taken advantage of. It's made worse but the fact that my SO never has money for herself and is living paycheck to paycheck. 

I don't want to cause a rift with my in laws so I don't address little sister myself, but I feel my SO should be doing this.

Anyway last night I had a go at my SO about letting her little sister walk all over us, invading our privacy and generally taking advantage. Needless to say, it didn't go down well and Valentine's day is ruined.

Thanks for the replies all, I forgot to add that SO and myself have discussed this previously and she is aware that I was frustrated with how things were going.

We decided to stop at Smokes Poutine to get a nice triple pork. So we all get our food and then decide to walk home and eat when we get there.

Now, one thing to note is that it is around -10 degrees celcius. Everyone wants to get home because it's cold and we are all hungry. We start walking and then my girlfriend starts to eat our poutine. We are about a 5 minute walk to our place and I start to get annoyed. Our pace has slowed down and the poutine is getting cold.

It’s stupid and at any given time, every student knows who’s in first and it’s basically a glorified popularity contest.

I have so many stories about how big of a POS she turned out to be, but the two that comes to my mind is that we planned to go to this school dance, and she told me the night of that “she’s not feeling well” before 4 hours later, I saw pictures of her on Instagram at the party. The final straw came when I confronted her with her flakiness via text and she said “nobody likes you, not even your dad. That’s why he left, now leave me alone” for no other reason but to hurt me, because she knew that’s why I was going through a bad depression at the time.

1495,"AITA for refusing to be a friend's character reference for army enlistment because I disagree morally with military recruitment? Context: United States. 

&#x200B;

A good friend of mine has asked me to be her character reference to support her enlistment in the army. I have advocated on her behalf during her challenging college search and have always been firmly in her corner even when no one else was. She often feels like she's living in more successful peoples' shadow, including her brother, who just recently enlisted. She has yet to tell me why she's joining, just that she needs a reference. She has never once mentioned the army before this. 

&#x200B;

However, I find military recruitment morally reprehensible. I went to HS in an impoverished district and saw a lot of penniless students get swept up into military service just so they could get through college and have the same opportunities as their wealthier counterparts. If someone feels genuinely passionate about serving their country, then I say more power to 'em. I can respect that. But I can't respect the downright predatory and manipulative techniques used to bolster recruitment, particularly the targeting of minorities, the impoverished, and women. 

&#x200B;

I want to support my friend in whatever path she chooses in life, but I feel very uneasy about actively supporting her choice to join the army. I don't really want to be an active participant in her enlistment because I don't think she's joining for the right reasons, and I think recruitment played a huge role in her decision. I of course will emotionally support her no matter what.

1497,"AITA for being frustrated about my loud neighbour? I'm living in a house at the end of a row of houses in a very quiet area. Most of my neighbours are elderly couples whose children have already moved out. A couple of months ago, a family with two small kids - 4-5ish - moved into the house directly next to us. 

&#x200B;

I work from home for a company in a different time zone. My work starts at 3 pm, and it ends around 11pm. Thus, my sleeping schedule is a bit unusual, I go to bed at around 1-1.30 am, and usually sleep until 9 am. The main bedroom window is facing the front of the house, right next to the neighbour house and above their door (as it is with all houses in the street). My neighbours are aware of my working hours and that I am a light sleeper who is easily disturbed. I sleep with the window partially opened, as it is usual where I come from.

&#x200B;

One of the kids of our neighbours hates having to go to kindergarden. She will throw a tantrum every day. The dad takes them there, and he is discussing with his unwilling daughter every morning in front of their door, right below my open bedroom window, about her not wanting to go to kindergarden, at 7 in the morning. This wakes me up. Every day I get woken up two hours earlier than my alarm is set to go off by a crying toddler, and an angry father. I get up, close the window, close the blinders all the way, and usually manage to fall back asleep again but I usually will sleep for half an hour longer then because of the interruption and missed sleep.

My mother, aunt, and sister are insisting I should speak to my neighbour about it, and tell him to be more considerate. I don't trust their judgement in such situations, because they tend to be very feisty and entitled. I am majorly annoyed by the situation and do think the neighbour is being inconsiderate, however, I am not sure if I am biased here because I do not like children in general, and tend to get easily and overly annoyed by them, anyways. And it's me who is living on an unusual schedule, it's nothing really unusual to be up and about at 7 am in my country.

I (38m) have a coworker/friend (40m) that I talk to on a regular basis, but the vast majority of our communication lately is via text, as we both have personal lives and family that consumes a lot of our time. We don’t work in the same exact area, but do see each other for meetings and events, and go out to lunch when we get an opportunity.

A lot of our conversations we have are centered around work, and since we share a lot of the same management and coworkers that work between departments (plus he used to work in my department, coworkers are the focus of some of these conversations. 

Now, I’m not super gossipy or anything, but we do talk about who isn’t competent or productive, or who is being a problem at work, what we don’t like about our managers, etc...

Here’s where the problem comes in. We had a huge work event, and at this event, my friend loses his phone. He seems fairly indifferent, until it comes up that he has NO SCREEN LOCK.

I proceeded to tear into him about not locking his phone. He tells me that he’s not concerned with other people reading his stuff, but all my conversations with him are on it, all his friends, his family, and probably other coworkers. My phone number is in his phone, social media contacts, possibly address, all in his phone.

I feel like in an era of text heavy communication and online information people have an obligation to lock their phone to protect not only themselves, but the people they talk to. Now I have no idea who is digging through his phone and what information they have or what conversations they have read through/shared with other people.

As I tried so savor the moment he said ""are you gonna say yes??"" Like he was rushing to get up.

What inspired me mentioning it was I recently saw a video of our friend's proposal and I admit I was filled with jealousy. He sincerely looked at her and went on and on about how happy he was to be with her. I think I said something to my partner to the effect of ""I was a little jealous seeing that."" And then as we talked I expressed that I was overall happy he proposed and happy with many of the other details but I wish it had included some other words.

He said he had no idea that it was a thing to add in extra words and it didn't come up in the little research he did, which I believe. He said now he felt kind of bad that he knew the proposal wasn't all that I had hoped. I definitely don't begrudge him for not doing it and hold no ill-will (which I made clear) because I don't think he was negligent.

In general he treats me extremely well. We both try to do things for each other and treat each other kindly, have fun, etc... However he rarely will fully sincerely tell me kind things. He might say ""I love you"" in a silly voice.. and in general almost all words of affection he shares are playful. I would still say we are quite affectionate, it's just not often serious on his end. I say serious things and it looks like he freezes a bit. I come from a more open and emotional family and his family is not.

I originally just brought the proposal up out of honesty because I do think we have a pretty open communication channel. Thinking about it more, I suppose I had hoped it would be clear to him that it's something is important to me. (Edit for clarity: my original motive was just to openly communicate what I thought, but I hoped that by saying something, I was making it clear that this is something that is and will be important to me for the future, not to be say I hoped it was clear I wanted more words in the proposal). I also have a fear that what he says during the ceremony will not be sincere, so that's another reason it would help to mention it.

In my country, we don’t have Sex-Ed classes they’re more like seminars?

This years SSI shook it up a little and started talking about his kids, at first I was very interested thinking we can learn from their experience! But soon I was disappointed because he was just bragging about his kids.
I stopped listening, and got upset that he wasn’t getting to teaching.

At some point he tells me to take my headphones out of my ears, I do, with no comment.

Then SSI said  “If you do not wish to be here, you may leave”
I thought ‘Ha, sure. We all know the only way you can leave is if a teacher tells you to.’
Then I thought ‘man, how nice would it be if a teacher told me I can leave.’ Think of the devil! The CT kneeled next to me and told me I can leave! I left because who wouldn’t?

Few hours later, CT comes up to me and asked to talk.

Me “Ok, what do you want to talk about?”
CT “I want to talk about your attitude today”
Me “attitude? What attitude?”
CT “Your behavior was unacceptable”
Me “I was sitting quietly not bothering anyone, how is that unacceptable behavior?”
CT “Y-your face was unacceptable.”
Apparently I had a grumpy face the inter time in the seminar, I’m not surprised because I was pretty upset.
Me “sir, I’m sorry but I can’t see my own face.”
CT “I don’t like your resent behavior”
Me “sir, what does that have to do with this?”
CT “what would you do if I were to tell your parents about your behavior?”
I know what he’s trying to do, he’s trying to get me to cave, and beg him not to tell my parents.
Me “sigh, well my dad wouldn’t care because he’s in another country, and he can’t do anything about it. And my mom? Hmm… she would bother me about it for at most a week or so, would be annoying, but eh.”

Me “what?”

Me “You told me I could leave???”
CT “your the kind of student teachers would love at seminars”
Me “yeah, I know, then why did you tell me to leave??”
CT “Your behavior was unacceptable”

Me “do you want me to apologize to SSI?”
CT “NO! You’ll only upset our guest!”
Me “do you want me to go back in the seminar?”
CT “NO! I don’t want you back in that room!”
Me “Do you want me to leave?”
CT “NO! I want you to reflect on your actions!”
How am I supposed to reflect on my actions when I literally did nothing but sit there and be quiet?

Eventually I would ask my questions again just to make sure, and I got the same answer with;

1517,"AITA for having asked for money back for a shared purchase from an ex This has been bothering me for a few years, so here we go;

A couple of years back I lived with my then-boyfriend in his apartment for 1 year to attend school in that city.
I was unable to get a job during the time, so my only income was school support of DKR 900, or ~$135 pr month. Despite this, I agreed to pay half of all rent, bills and utilities, which totaled at around DKR 3000, or $450 month, if he payed for groceries. This meant that I had to use all my income, and payed the rest with my hard earned savings, which were meant to take me to Japan after graduating. I feel like it’s relevant, that during this, my ex himself was making DKR15000-18000/$2250-$2700 pr month, and therefor did not need my help to make ends meet. To help out I was also during the majority of the cleaning and shopping, as well as all the cooking and laundry.
Despite knowing that I had a heavily negative income, he didn’t really get it, and talked me into buying lots of stuff, including (most expensively and the reason for this post) a shared PS4 when they came out.
While we were dating, he offered a few times to pay me my half for it, but in my naive pride, I refused.
I finished school and moved out to live at a boarding school about an hour away to study Japanese. During my first 6 months, he visited me once and never wanted to talk, and when seeing him at Christmas, I realized that I was hoping for him to break up with me. He did not, so I worked up my guts for about a month and after talking with some friends, I broke up with him in early February. He did not take it well, but was “nice” enough to return most of my things.
About a month or two later, I remember the PS4, and text him asking for the money. He refuses. I then offer, despite still having a negative income, to buy my half then; again he refuses. This turned into a text fight, in which he claimed that since he payed groceries for a year, I actually owe him money for that, as well as rent and bills, even though I payed half for the time living there.
Eventually I gave up and tried to let it go, since I was distraught about it, but it’s always kept bothering me, so;

Was ITA for asking for my ex for my half of the money back for the PS4?",YTA. Just cut your losses and move on.

1526,"AITA For Changing Plans With My Girl? Hi Reddit. So I have a bit of a situation here. My girlfriend is moving to a city I will be moving to in a month an a half (she's moving with her friend, I am moving in with my friends). We've been together 4 years, we're right out of college (24 years old). Originally I was going to help her move in this coming weekend, but a few of my friends are having a party down south, so I can't go. She was cool with it and is having friends help her move some of her stuff that day. I had told her I was going to help her move and put her stuff together that next weekend.

However, something has come up. I only have 4 weeks to find a new place with my friends and while we were going to go in two weeks, one of my friends wants to start looking the day that I was going to help her move in the rest of her big stuff and help her put it together. We are also looking the weekend after, but the weekend after that we're going down south again for a boys weekend, so we're a bit pressed for time. I asked her if we can do it earlier in the morning, and let her know that I probably won't be able to help her assemble her stuff, but I can come back after and hang out. Or I told her she can meet us at my friends on the other side of the city.

She was pretty upset about this and I told her that she needs to stop worrying so much about things, which made her more upset, saying that not everything is about worrying. But she does worry about a lot of things which can be kind of annoying. Then she told me that she was not worried, but was upset/hurt about it. That is what I don't get - she's upset because I asked her if we can move earlier? She told me I am selfish and always prioritize plans with my friends over plans with her, but sometimes other things are just more important. I get that I had promised her that I would help her move in, assemble things, and go shopping with her, but I have to do what I have to do, and my friends don't want to look for an apartment on the next day because they don't want to look for an apartment when they are hungover (which I get).

1527,"AITA for giving away my birthday present? So, my best friend (female) tried to gift me (rather heavy male) a onesie for my birthday. As you could expect, it wouldn‘t fit, partly because she ordered one for people with a height max of 185cm, as she figured me being 186cm would still fit. I wasn‘t really disappointed, as i don‘t make much out of birthday presents (i didn‘t really ever get ‚huge‘ presents (sometimes none) as my family is a royal clusterfuck) anyway, but she felt terrible. 
So, she tried to remember anything i said or looked at in order to find something different to gift me, and settled on a Nintendo Switch Dock Cover, with an illuminated picture of a pikachu, which i looked at more than once at GameStop. 

Problem is, i have a special edition (Smash Bros.) version of the nintendo switch, so the dock cover would be pretty much useless for
me. I was looking for it bc i wanted to gift it to my brother, who has the generic switch dock and is overall more sympathetic to collecting plastic „garbage“. 

So, i gave the dock cover to my brother and bought myself a controller charging station, and told my friend that my brother swapped it with me. She seemed disappointed, and didn‘t really understand until i told her to look at my dock. 

With my birthday coming up again fairly soon, the topic has begun to come up again, but she did tell me not to say anything as to what to get me, as she wants it to be a ‚surprise‘ (which i really don‘t get, i‘m more happy to be gifted something at all, so even knowing what i‘ll get would not affect it), and ‚not be an ass again and give it away‘ like last year.

My fiancé comes from a super conservative and religious background but has thankfully grown way form that (otherwise I couldn't marry her!)

Her parents however are still super conservative and homophobic and delight in talking shit and all sorts of horrible tings about the LGBT community. Other members of her family are like this as well, some more violently vocal than others. 

Well, for our wedding we have decided that everyone we invite can bring a plus one (subject to our approval of course). 

I thought about it for a really long time about my older brother and his husband (they've been married 3 years) and I don't want his husband to attend with him.

1. I know they scored not as well, so if I told them I scored well, they would want me to help them. Now this put me in  a tough stop because if I help them then they would be competition, but turning them down is also very awkward.
2. Telling them that I scored shit could possibly lower their work ethic, if they know that I'm not competition.

That's fine, I have no problem with that opinion, you're allowed to hold that opinion, I did not take offense in any way. That then progressed to this (enter exact dialogue):

Me: And as somebody who is saving to open a pot restaurant, I should at least be somewhat familiar with the product...

Her: That is strange. What makes you want to get into that?

Me: It's a good way to avoid college and still make money and capitalize on the flourishing THC industry.

Her: Knowing how to cook as well as the states regulations on distribution and health regs is kind of a big deal. Is your degree in business? Finance management?

Me: The point of opening a restaurant is to avoid going to college. That being said I have done two semesters in college for business, so I know how to run one without running it into the ground.

Her: Welp what is your reasoning for not thinking this decision through? Do you know what kind of work goes into starting a business?

Me: I love how you just assume I haven't thought any of it through... Thanks. That makes me feel great. I actually did heavy research into this. I'm opening in Washington DC. Why? Because there are no other restaurants open in that area that offer marijuana substitutions, and they have a loophole in their laws. You can grow, ingest, and gift marijuana. You just can't sell it.

Her: You know that those two semesters doesn’t necessarily mean you can do it right?

Me: Okay, (Sister). Are you going to at least try to be a supportive sister for once, or do we need to talk later about something else?

Her: You do understand that as soon as you put pot into food and distribute the food you are essentially selling marijuana right?

Me: Unless I market it as a complimentary dose offered with food. It's enough of a loophole that I can get away with it.

(Repost letter count)
tldr: I hired a cleaner for a certain number of hours, i lied about the size of the house because i only wanted him to clean the bottom floor (so it hired him for 4 hours), he cleaned it so quickly so there is time to work on the upstairs but he is angry that there are more bedrooms and bathrooms than listed, even tho ive told him he doesnt have to finish it all, only the time i hired him for.

So, I used an app to pay for a cleaner to come today, Its something me and my siblings do when we use our parents house when they travel (we are between the ages of 17 - 22 so we can pull together enough money for it) and when they are away, we have more freinds over than usual, might have a house party. They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can. But hiring a proffesional with their tools and solutions really helps.

Its really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.

I played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or it would've 
 have hired the cleaner for much longer.

So it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.

Hes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says ""THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED"" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.

Hes still huffing and getting annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hired him for and then leave. Even if its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.","YTA

After coming out to us and his friends, his self-esteem has improved a lot  though and I‘m super proud of him!

One thing my brother loves is make-up. From what I can see he‘s pretty good with it too (we always joke about him becoming a Youtube MUA after he graduates) and even though I don’t know too much about this kinda stuff, it makes me happy that he‘s found a hobby.

A few weeks ago, my brother was hanging out with friends and left the house with full make-up on (brows, eyeshadow, eyeliner, etc.). When he got back, he told me some guys he ran into were really rude to him and called him names. He was scared they would get violent so he just ran away. I comforted him and added that it might be a good idea to stop wearing make-up in public and just do it at home for now. He was pretty upset by that and accused me of victim blaming and trying to stop him from expressing himself. Before I could even say anything he left the room and now refuses to speak to me.

I feel like my brother twisted my words here. He can do whatever he wants as long as he‘s happy and not inconveniencing someone else. The reason why I suggested it is because I‘m scared something might happen to him. I don’t want him to get assaulted or insulted by close-minded people when he‘s outside and I‘m not there to protect him.
On the other hand, maybe I went about it the wrong way and shouldn’t have said something like that at all, idk.

So, AITA for what I said?","YTA unfortunately. 

Despite intentions in the right place, part of being a supportive ally to your brother is accepting his right to self-expression.  What you did is victim blaming.  Your brother needed to feel heard, understood and supported.  You gave him unsolicited advice.   

You sound like a loving sibling, can I add insight?
Makeup, clothing, voice affect are some ways gay people may choose to signal their sexuality.  This right to self-expression is so important for you brother. He needs your support.  If you want to be a good ally consider apologizing.",1,YTA,1.0,1.0,1
1555,"AITA for making my ""Christian"" family pray with me at Christmas dinner? Context: Im 22F and am visiting my parents and brother over break. I am a Christian while my parents and 18 yr old bro are ""Christian"". I say ""Christian"" because, growing up, I always had a weird relationship with God/church. If anything, it was kinda God-lite. Like, my mom would make my brother and I watch Jesus Christ Superstar every Easter, and she bought me a Children's Bible and all this other kiddie Bible stuff. Yet, we never went to church, and she would often complain about her sister/my aunt growing up about how she would always be so preachy about being a Christian, and how she was extremely judgmental, which I took to be true because, well, I was a kid.

Fast forward to age 20 and, after years of experimenting with religion then eventually being agnostic, I find God. I met people who actually showed me the Bible (not watered down stuff or musicals lol) and could answer my questions, and I was baptized a few months later. Even today, I am actively involved in my church and my Bible study group. When I told my parents about this initially, they seemed shocked but really supportive, and were even excited about me finding God and how they would see me in Heaven and all of that. They, even to this day, ask me all about it and act all proud when I silently pray at dinner/talk about my church and tell me ""Good job!"" (which is odd tbh). They're also kinda wishy-washy about it, though. They don't read the Bible, so sometimes they'll make incorrect assumptions about what it says, and when I correct them they get upset. My mom also got upset when she was telling me that she didn't need to go to church or read the Bible to be a Christian, and I was trying to explain the benefits of both (NOT try and force her to or anything for the record, just explain how it can broaden her knowledge/relationship w God). She called me, surprise, judgmental.

So tonight, Jesus's birthday, my parents asked me to pray over the food. Since they always ask me to pray alone at these things, I decided to then ask, ""Why don't we all pray for the food?"" My mom looked kinda taken aback and replied, ""Well, we \*do\* all pray when you pray..."" I reply, ""No no, I mean *all* of us!"" Then my dad goes, ""Oh, I think she wants us to go in a circle and pray,"" and I go, ""Yeah! That!"" Then my mother and brother audibly groaned which really shocked me. They all then kinda halfheartedly said some prayers (""Thank you God for this food amen"" or something like that) and I did my prayer, then we ate. Later, my mom ended up telling me, ""That was really unnecessary, VeryLoudBees,"" and was pretty pissed off at me for the rest of the night. ??

I'm genuinely not trying to be judgmental here and I want to see their POV, I just dont get why they claim to be Christian then act offended when someone does something Christian if that makes sense. But, yeah, I'm not sure if I was out of line here or not...I'm just confused in general tbh





I guess a lot of my frustration really just stems from the fact that they (in general, not necessarily tonight) actively encourage me to talk about it and then sometimes get mad at me for talking about it in the same conversation? Like, they'll ask me about what we talked about in Bible study, then go on about the topic being ""weird"". Sometimes, they even make fun of me in the same conversation. For example, recently my dad asked me, ""Aren't you supposed to hate gay people,"" after I was telling him a funny story about a friend of mine and his boyfriend, and when I said no, he said, ""Oh, so you're a fake then, huh?"" Another time I was talking about a Wiccan friend, and my dad said something along the lines of, ""Stop associating with witchcraft. They're heathens."" There have been other similar conversations.

Basically, I've just been very confused and upset and it's been hard for me to get what they want from me, you know? I feel like they act happy for me but might not actually be, whether or not that's the truth. It's been a very frustrating winter break but yeah at the end of the day I think I was def being the asshole in this situation. My frustration with their behavior should not have led to this. I'm leaving up the original post for obvious reasons (quotations and all, which as many of you pointed out was also not cool and I appreciate y'all telling me that) but also wanted to add that I hear you and I wanted to add some more reasoning behind my own frustration. It definitely came across as ""I'm a way better Christian than them because xyz"" when there's definitely more anger behind it than I added in the original 3000 character word limit.

1558,"AITA Baby shower drama My wife and I are due to have our first baby in mid January. We are having 3 showers, one for my wife’s friends, one for my wife’s family hosted by her aunt, and one with my family hosted by my mom, pretty standard. The other two showers have already taken place. My mom was not invited to the other two showers, because they were separate families. My wife asked me if they should invite my mom to her families shower which I responded probably not because she would not really know anyone.

Fast forward and my mom is planning the other baby shower, and my mother in law texted my mom asking if there was anything she could help with (she was initially on the invite list). My mom didn’t text her back and when invites were sent didn’t send one. My wife asked if her mom was invited and I told her that yes because my mom had never told me otherwise.

Now that the shower is coming up, I finally asked who was invited and asked if my mother in law was invited. She said no I wasn’t invited to there’s so why should I invite her to mine? This upset my wife, because we had said that her mom was invited and my moms feelings are hurt for not being invited. My wife obviously knows that my mom is upset with her too, and it’s made a bunch of awkwardness.

My wife said she had checked with her friends previously to see if they had invited the husbands mom to the showers. They all said they didn’t, but said it was customary for the moms mom to be invited to all showers. Additionally, as I had said previously I told my wife to not invite her because she wouldn’t know anyone.

I see both sides, but I feel like my mom is being a bit petty and causing unnecessary drama and tension a month before the baby is born and any complaints should have been aired in a different manner and now everyone is upset with each other. I have a great relationship with my mom and mother in law, and this kind of just came out of nowhere yesterday.

​

I think most of this stems from my father's dislike of my mother's side of the family. This is a long-standing issue. Anyways, my aunt and cousin attend a recent family celebration. At this celebration, my father is missing a bottle of liquor and accuses my aunt of taking it. She denies it (she has liver cancer and wouldn't be drinking anyways). Coupled this with my cousin, whom acts coldly toward him, my father essentially removes himself from the celebrations. Later, my father and mother argue about my cousin and aunt being there. Also, he later finds the bottle of liquor had simply fallen behind the couch. Of course, my sisters sees how upset her father is.

​

My sister has a destination wedding planned to hawaii. My cousin reached out to let my sister know that she was able to come to the wedding. My sister responds that it was ok, but her mother (our aunt) was not invited in order to avoid drama. My cousin took offense and wanted to know how her mother was causing our family drama. My sister does not like conflict and has been avoiding communicating with my cousins since. My aunt has cancer and has been saddened by the whole situation.

1560,"AITA for being kinda glad that my gf's dog died? One of the first things I loved about my girlfriend when we first started dating was how much she loved her dog. She would bring him hiking, to farmer markets, take him to the beach, go on Sunday drives with him etc. So when I say she loved this dog it is not an understatement, she considered him her best friend and soul mate. I got close to him too and came to love him as well. Unfortunately a couple of months ago her dog fell ill with some sort of neurological problem. She was with him practically 24/7 for like a month and spent thousands of dollars at the vet only to have to eventually put him to sleep. She was heartbroken to say the least. It was a hard time but I assured her it was for the best. I don't think my girlfriend could have taken care of him much longer it was a full time job and she was both physically and mentally exhausted. I was glad this huge stress was finally relieved for her, but I was also glad about more than that. I hadn't thought about it much before this but once her dog was gone I realized how much of her time and attention he consumed. He was always her cuddle partner in bed and on the couch, she constantly doted on him, and scheduled her life around him. In a way her love for her dog was kind of in the way of us progressing our relationship. Because of this I can't help but feel kind of glad her dog is gone, but at the same time I feel that I shouldn't because she has been really depressed ever since. I tried to cheer her up by telling her we could get a new dog together that would be both of ours, she did not like this idea in the least.

1562,"AITA for telling my best friend she shouldn't adopt children? My ex best friend (female) and I (also female) had been friends for ten years. I had never had a true best friend before so I kept hanging on, despite the fact that she didn’t always treat me the best. For example, she never supported the relationships I was in and she would poke fun at me for gaining weight off and on.

When we hung out, it was always where she wanted to go and we did what she wanted to do. She loved going to clubs but it wasn’t my thing. When guys would approach me, she’d tell them to get lost because we were having a girls’ night. I didn’t mind chatting with them but she would be annoyed that I was giving them the time of day: “They only want one thing. Quit wasting your time.” (She always considered me a bit naïve in the guy department.)

When my boyfriend and I started getting serious, he said he wanted to meet my best friend. We decided to meet up with her and her new boyfriend. Afterward, my friend called to tell me that her boyfriend said he once bought drugs from my boyfriend. I told her I didn’t believe him and her boyfriend told me the story. I was taken aback and asked my boyfriend about it. He said no, he’s never sold drugs and had no idea what her boyfriend was talking about. My friend was adamant that her boyfriend was correct and that I shouldn’t be dating a drug dealer. (Her boyfriend is over here buying drugs and my boyfriend is supposedly the problem? Also, my best friend used to have a drug problem and had to drop out of college as a result. I’m not sure if she was using again at this point.) She never wanted to hang out with my boyfriend because he’s supposedly a drug dealer and, obviously, she didn't approve of the relationship.

Months later, my friend came out as a lesbian. (When we first met, she told me she was bi but preferred women.) Her new girlfriend never wanted to meet me because she has jealously issues and didn’t think we should be friends. We hung out alone without our significant others and could never get together as couples. It was also weird that, as best friends, we couldn’t talk about our significant others since they didn't like us as individuals.

At some point, we’re chatting on the phone and my friend states that she wants to adopt a child. I’m not sure where this was coming from since she’s never expressed interest in having children, didn’t have a stable or well-paying job, just started dating someone new (the girlfriend that doesn’t like me), etc. Taken aback, but still annoyed about the whole significant other situation, I blurted out, “But gays shouldn’t adopt children!” I have no idea where that came from and I certainly did NOT mean it or believe what I said.

1565,"AITA for wanting a new bed? I am currently unemployed, finished Uni, still living with my parents, but wanting to move in with my bf soon and strongly allergic to furry animals, which resulted in me getting 4 or 5 years ago asthma since I live with cats. The overall allergy doesn't manifest as an usual cat allergy - I can be around cats, what really triggers asthma and allergy for me is dusty environment.

Since I want to move in with my bf, who is from a neighbouring country with a totally different language (its Hungarian, with I understand only a few words), I have problems to find a job suitable for me - no work experience except a part time job and translation/ language related Uni aren't helping me much. At my bf apartment, I get less of allergy symptoms even if he owns 2 cats partly thanks to having a normal bed. At my parents' apartment, I sleep on a pull out futon sofa, which wasn't really build for every night sleeping on - the pull out part is wood with thin foam on top, which got worn out quickly and isn't comfortable anymore + the whole sofa is covered in cat hair collecting textile, it doesn't matter how much you try cleaning it you can't get rid of all the dust and cat hair.

&#x200B;

I wasn't happy with the futon for a long time, hinted to my parents for at least 2 years that I would need a better and proper bed and they tried to compromise by buying a thin mattress to put on top and an air filter for my asthma that I have constantly running next to the sofa. Both helped somewhat, but my asthma always got back a month or so after. When I sneeze, have a runny nose and cough for several nights in a row and have to take meds and inhaler to just be able to fall asleep and feel terrible in the morning,I manage to get a big grumpy when parents don't seem to care enough, bring in more saved stray cats (have 5 in total now, but we have a big apartment so cats are doing well, no overcrowding) and tell you to just do sports outside, while the allergy doctors are alarmed my lung capacity dropped so low.

&#x200B;

Last month I caught a cold that concentrated on flooding my lungs with slime I was coughing constantly and not getting any air when trying to sleep. The only place I could sleep was closing myself in the bathroom and sleeping on the floor with a yoga mat under me. Parents bought me a sleeping air mat, which didn't survive longer than a week, even if I tried to not let the cats near it. After the worst part of the cold went away I evacuated to my bfs appartment since my asthma still was extremly strong but I still need to get back to my parents place once in a while sice all my doctors (allergy, dentist...) are there.

I still can't sleep on the futon since that cold, even with meds and parents refuse to buy me a new bed stating I can buy me one from my first salary (my parents are well off if they wanted to buy a bed its not a problem).

Personally, I always put in the effort to make him happy, such as always putting work aside to talk about his anxieties, giving money for him to eat when he runs out (he goes to school while I work a job), and he recognized that I took this relationship very seriously and appreciated me for my efforts, which I had been thankful for. 

So we coped with our distance by seeing each other every month and planning fun activities, and this time (In October) I flew over to visit him for a week that I had taken off. Building up to this dinner, I had been mad at him for something for a while, and he was always promising me to make it up to me by taking me out to this restaurant he said he’s always been wanting to take me. 

So the big day comes and we head out on a Saturday night. The restaurant was nice and I was in a great mood—until he told me he left his wallet at home. 

I got complete upset at him. I felt like he didn’t care, about me or about this dinner enough—if he did he wouldn’t have made such a basic error. For the whole dinner I was just pretty upset and didn’t really talk to him much, and he said that I was ruining what would have been a great night by focusing on such a small error. From my perspective, this small error revealed his lack of care and attentiveness—would you forget your pencils for the SAT, or forget your passport when you’re flying? He disagreed and said I was overreacting. 

AITA?

EDIT: throughout the relationship I’ve always felt like I’ve been the one putting in more effort and taking things more seriously, and I have to admit that, as a result, I get angry and insecure much more easily. It can become a habit for him to do something I think is not caring, I get mad, he puts effort into apologizing to me.

1588,"WIBTA in this bad haircut situation. Ok so this is a really weird one

My husband is amazing, first off. But he went for a haircut today and he absolutely hates it. His hair is normally amazing, really cool etc and he takes a lot of pride in his appearance- rightly so. But it’s a really bad haircut. I know what you’re thinking, how bad can a hair cut be, right? But it’s shit. 

The dilemma starts here. Basically we had had a Christmas friend/family day booked at a cabin for months, mellow; chilled; Christmas jumper; log fire; mulled wine sorta day planned with all the trimmings planned for a few months. But a few weeks ago he got an invite to his work’s Christmas night out on the same day to which he initially declined because of prior plans.

But then he started getting really pressured into going to the night out because he’s been amazing at work and he’s going to be getting a secret award (they had to tell him about it to get him to go so he knows) so he eventually caved because 3 bosses basically told him he “had” to go (free bar) but not getting paid for going. I totally understand his situation and told him he could go and come to the cabin after it was annoying he couldn’t spend the day but I was fine with it (secretly raging inside) but it’s totally up to him what he does.

So he went for the hair cut and it’s shit. He hates it. WIBTA if I said well you wouldn’t be comfortable going to get the award so just stay with us in the cabin?

1. we live in a country not native to our own so we won’t have a proper Christmas Day

Me six years ago: in a crazy unhealthy relationship with my ex who was addicted to every substance known to man. We were both physically and emotionally abusive.

It was actually his parents who stepped in and ""saved"" me from their son, as such I've always had tremendous respect and love for them.

(we live in a dorm, at uni,  in close enough proximity to each other to be able to see each other)

so I don't usually sleep a lot (I go to bed late and get up early), but I was extra tired so I went to bed at about 9:00 P.M.  It didn't take me long to fall asleep even though my roommate was playing on his console. Anyways, he constantly keeps waking me up: turning lights on and off, yelling at people in chat, and slamming shit when he gets pissed he dies. I'm sleeping intermittently, and he finally decides it time to go to sleep somewhere around 12-12:30 A.M. he's super loud and wakes me up as he's getting ready for bed/doing random shit (if I purposefully kept him up bc of this tho...major YTA. because usually I'm not in the room at this time and normally awake if i am).

I mostly just lay in my bed trying to go back to sleep as he passes out, and can't. so i get bored around 1:30 and start fucking around on reddit, and eventually see a post that reminds me of the dc aquaman movie that i still hadn't seen at about 3 A.M.

1594,"WIBTA for not going to my sister's wedding if she doesn't remove someone from the guest list? (Obligatory sorry for the formatting, as I'm on mobile)

&nbsp;

So my (24M) sister (28F) is getting married later this year. She's been living with and dating her fiancé for upwards of 5 years now and I'm very excited for this next step in her life. We don't talk too often but that's just the pace of our relationship. When we do talk, we always get on.

&nbsp;

So some backstory - my parents have been split up for about 3 years now, but not divorced. My father is an alcoholic, is manipulative, and has cheated more times than I can count. My sister has always had a closer relationship to him than I have and she was away at college when the gist of the shit hit the fan and he left the house (his choice). Because of this, she's always been a little more forgiving and open to his actions, etc.

For the past 2 years or so (off and on), my father has been seeing a woman. This woman knew he was married and had a family. Now, I understand that if a couple are separated and divorcing, that there's a grey area in which relationships may form. However, there was no divorce and my father was essentially stringing my mother along saying he wanted to take care of her and wouldn't be able to if he divorced her, all the while my mother was hoping he would change and get help for the alcoholism, etc. (different discussion altogether).

&nbsp;

Back to now - my sister is planning her wedding for October, the divorce is finally being filed, and my mother is going into debt to pay for lawyer fees to assure that my father (who earns about 1000% more than her annually) doesn't abuse the system to leave her out to dry.

My father went to visit my sister and offered to pay for her wedding. Up until this point, my sister has stated many times to both myself and my mother that she did not want my father's lady friend to attend. Now today, a few weeks after my father visited and helped choose venues, etc. She called my mother and started talking about how she thinks my father's lady friend is so nice and is very pretty (to my mother's face). And that the lady friend offered not to go, but my sister insisted that she do.

&nbsp;

It seems clear that my father has manipulated my sister and that she's also in a tough position with my father paying for the wedding. However, it seems like a slap in my mother's face to not only say those things, but to tell her one thing and then insist the other, when she knows how incredibly painful the whole process is for my mother and that I have no desire to know of, see, or interact with the woman he cheated on my mother with.

I think this is horrible, and now I'm quite upset with her mum. How could she not say that, or hug her. I just don't understand. All I'm thinking right now is that I want to confront her mum about it, but I feel like that's not my place to say anything.

So Reddit, am I the asshole in this situation or am I right to feel how I do about this.

So I got a text from my live-in landlord (who is also a good friend) that our smud bill is $268 right now (up from approx $120), most likely because of the usage of the heaters. She said that she is nixing heater usage, including personal heaters and heated blankets. I don't use heating equipment; if I get cold I wrap myself up in a blanket. I do have a personal heater that my landlord usually uses in her room and sometimes sets up in my room when we're hanging out.

We have another roommate, Reese, who I know uses the heater and forgets to turn it off. I have made mention of times when I come home and no one else is home, and the heater is still on. Even texting her right now, she's confirming that she comes home and it's on because ""he forgot to turn it off""

I really feel like I'm being taken advantage of if I'm expected to foot this bill. Most of the time, I'm not even home when it's on, so I'm not getting the benefits of the heat regardless of my decision.

1616,"AITA for speaking the truth in how I felt and acting as confident as possible? (Kinda long) Sorry for the shitty punctuation and spelling in advance.

A little backstory, I'm a young adult who thinks they know everything with 2 younger brothers a mom and a dad. 

This evening I went out to dinner with them and throughout the car ride I was noticing my mom would get very emotional for reasons I am unsure of.  My middle brother who is fresh out of high school would get very triggered at small things I would say. Example my youngest brother and I do not have an interest in watching the show death note. My middle brother keeps pressuring us to watch it and when we say we don't want to he thinks that we think that it is ""too gay"" or ""anime is for losers"". Quite the contrary it seems like a cool show but we just don't want to get into it. I finally called him out on his flawed logic and he got very defensive and emotional on which I called him out on further. 

Later at dinner my family seemed to be judging me based on my interactions with them and the waitress, I was looking at the menu for craft beers and had 2 questions for the waitress, when I asked I asked in what I perceived as a confident projecting voice (although I did stumble over my words a bit which is important) after she left my middle brother made a comment on how I stumble over my words because the waitress was hot. This did not offend me, however I told him in again what I perceived as a confident projecting voice that I really didn't care that I stumbled over my words and that I didn't care that I sent the waitress to ask the bartender the questions I asked her. My dad then stepped in and made the point that I do talk loud (I be sure I talk loud and direct to 1. Be more confident in my everyday life 2. To make sure I am not overheard) I made my dad aware of this and he furthered the point that I was ""just being an asshole"" my mother agreed with him and I do not know why. 

Side note: I generally try to be a funny type of guy so I tend to act very outlandish/ unique while in public. My friends would tell you it works because I come off as confident. Kind of an explanation for the next part

Anyway as we were leaving I walked with a bunch of what I call swagger with a tooth pick in my mouth out the door as my middle brother held it open and shot him a sup bro head bob as a joke, per the toothpick prop and goofy walking style, which further infuriated him. Later in the car ride back to my mom and dad's house my middle brother got very angry when he told me I was being an ass and I told him that I didn't care, Because I honestly didn't. He was so enraged by this point that he had threatened to punch me and my father had threaten to do the same. My mom is mad at this point because of ""all the fuss""

I was thinking of this whole situation when I got back to my house and I called my dad to ask if I was honestly being an asshole. He said that when I say things people don't want to hear such as ""I recognize that I am pissing you off and I cant see why you are angry and I also don't care"" it makes me come off as arrogant. I told him it was me being sure of my thoughts emotions and actions. He must have had me on speakerphone because I then heard my mom say ""that is so something that asshole would say"" I then suggested that maybe they are not perceiving my actions in the right way and that if they saw me as being an asshole then maybe their whole worldview is out of wack. To which my combat veteran father took as a I'm better than you and you don't know what you are talking about and then proceeded to tell me about how his tours shaped him and that he has perceived more than I can possibly imagine, which my very well be the case but I still don't see where I went wrong.

Am I an asshole for being true to what I thought of the situations?

Am I an asshole for not keeping my mouth shut?

Am I an asshole for trying to be confident  but coming off as arrogant?

A key point to consider: I have generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and derealization and depersonalization (a type of dissociative disorder) I know I'm crazy right??! Lol anyway in order to cure this I am practicing, under medical supervision, mindfulness or the practice of being in touch with ones thoughts and emotions. A key part of this is being honest and truthful with yourself and other also letting go of small outcome such as conversations also it involves being confident and meaning what you say. I was very sure I was in the moment and was conscience of my responses to each of their questions or statements. 
 
Also it's worth saying that my family will probably be over this soon, and basically the only reason I'm posting this is so I can gauge if me trying to act confident is perceived by other people as arrogant. For self improvement purposes I don't really want to be an asshole

","I'm not sure where to start, but I think you have the wrong idea of what 'confident' is.

'Confident' is *not* never admitting you're wrong, which is what you seem to be taking it as. You focus way too much on how *you* look, on how *you* come across, on how *you* are perceived. This makes you appear self-absorbed, arrogant, and therefore an asshole.

You don't have low confidence if you have empathy, and it seems like you have absolutely no empathy. This statement...

>""I recognize that I am pissing you off and I cant see why you are angry and I also don't care""

Is NOT you being sure of your thoughts, emotions, and actions. It's you only caring about yourself, and not giving a goddamn about how anyone else feels. You may perceive this as 'confident'. But it is not in any way a valuable quality. It is assholish. If you are pissing someone you love off, you *should* care. 

You need to break yourself of the mindset of seeing caring as weakness, or as not being confident. You should empathize with people. If you are really confident, you won't have to tell yourself I Am Being Confident every minute of every day, which is what you seem to be doing.

If I had a choice between being confident and speaking the truth or being kind, I would always choose being kind. It is far more important to be kind than right. Sometimes you need to compromise for the sake of your relations with other people, and I think you need to learn that.

So I run a DND game for a group of friends around the world every Thursday. This game has been going on for years now and has become a very big thing in our groups life. 

I have always had a problem with one player who ruins the fun for everyone else with his controlling and disruptive behaviour. This lead to a massive full blown yelling match where he really upset other players. 

He’s currently going through a lot in life. His mum is recovering from cancer, his sister is still getting use to being heavily disabled due to a crash and is lashing out and he got fired.  We have tried to be there for him as much as possible but he is a very stubborn person who has very self destructive tendencies. Which has lead to a massive rift in our friendship group between him and another player. 

I have had many issues with this player before but all of this bled through into the game on Thursday and led to a very big personal argument that nearly destroyed the group as a whole. 

Now this group consists of 5 other people who all have had very difficult times over the years and have used this game to escape them for a few hours. It means a lot to all of us. Because of this and how negative and destructive he became I told him to take a break as I thought the game was doing more harm to his mental state than offering escapism. 

He took a month off and is now considering coming back. His situation has improved but I’m still worried that his mental state is not at a level it should be. Also the game has been running a lot smoother without him. Everyone else has been able to actually play, no arguments and people’s attitude has be lifted a bit.

We fell out of touch for awhile and reconnected a few years ago. However recently it’s really dawned on me that she’s super self centered, as in if I vent about anything she’ll completely ignore it and bring the conversation back to her and her problems. And it’s not like she’s going through a crisis, it’s literally almost always boy problems or her telling me about her most recent hookup. 
I’ve also been in the process of bettering myself (working out, spending less time on social media, eating healthier, etc) and I feel like I’m super productive. I’m not a prude by any means but she smokes a shit ton of weed and that’s something I’ve simply grown out of. It wouldn’t bother me but it does make me feel like we’re on totally different wavelength. 
And the cherry on the cake is her racism. It’s not super “obvious” but she makes little comments about how she could never date a POC or places are “ghetto” when they’re really just not predominately white. Or she’ll cross the street if she sees a black person walking towards her. Which is all bad enough but it’s worse because I’m dating a POC.

Backstory:  On multiple occasions I've told my wife that I'd prefer she left the trash out by the curb than leave it blocking my entry into the garage on the driveway.  I prefer to fully park and turn off my car, then handle bringing the trash in, rather than park on the driveway, get out and take the trash in, get back in the car and pull it in, then park it and turn it off.

Fast forward to today coming back from happy hour where she met me and my coworkers, I was right in front of her and the trash bin was on the driveway blocking me.  I pulled into the driveway and waited for her to pull in so she could move it to its rightful place in the garage.  First she waited in the street next to the driveway, but I waved her in because I wanted her to move the trash can.  Then she pulled in and parked and got out.  She realized what I was waiting for and gave me a very dirty look while putting the trashcan away.  I proceeded to pull in and park and get out of the car.  Then she started telling me how much of a jerk I was.  I never even said anything, I just thought it wouldn't be a big deal for her to move it since she wasn't blocked and I've told her before I'd prefer her to leave it and I'll get it after I pull into the garage.

1622,"AITA for trying to include my boyfriend in hangouts with my close friends? So for some background, I’ve been close friends with Alice (23f) since the beginning of high school. 2 years later we meet a boy named Aleks (20m) who is my now boyfriend. At the time Alice clearly had /strong/ feelings for Aleks, i had a slight crush on him but i left it alone because Alice is my best friend. TLDR Aleks never liked Alice, he always liked me. 5 years later we get together after I explicitly ask Alice if she would be okay with this, if there was anything we need to talk about before I continue with Aleks. She gave us her blessing. 

6 months later, there’s a couple instances where my friends and I plan to go out, to Disneyland, a food market, dinner, etc. For almost every “event” I ask if Aleks can join because he’s a big part of my life and I want to integrate him with my friends. I didn’t think it was a such a big deal but Alice messages me privately that these events are too special to her because it’s rare that all of us are able to get together to do anything, that it annoys her when I ask for Aleks to join if we plan anything and that if I want Aleks around them it can only be when I make the plans and I clearly state that Aleks will be a part of the event.

I told her that’s a ridiculous request, I only asked if Aleks could come every time we made plans because every single time he wasn’t allowed to come. Not because everyone said no, but only because Alice said no. She accused me of not making the effort to be with them and only using my free time to be with Aleks. I pointed out that I repeatedly tried to make plans like getting dinner or ice cream and everyone either didn’t respond or turned me down, so of course most of my time is spent with Aleks, who actually makes time for me.

At this point Alice got fed up and said this argument was going nowhere, that my friends and her have been planning to sit down and have a talk with me about everything they’re upset about anyway so we should just end the conversation there. That was in October 2019, the “talk” still hasn’t happened. In fact there’s hardly any communication in our group chat now. But I’ll see my friends posting their hang outs together on snapchat so clearly there’s some communication that doesn’t include me anymore. 

I already don’t consider myself a part of this friend group anymore, but Im torn between trying to make amends to get my friends back and thinking I don’t owe anyone an apology, like I was just trying to include two parts of my lives together.

Anyway my last boyfriend whom I dated last year was an asshole. It was definitely a toxic relationship and despite myself I often found myself talking to other guys, just for attention as I felt abandoned in my relationship. 

Fast forward to today. I am currently dating a guy who is amazing and I love him and we have been dating for four months now. Everything is going perfect

Over the course of the last two weeks, I started talking to (let’s name him Steve to make this easier) I started talking to Steve, the guy I used to sext and be in a friends with benefits relationship with. Steve and I have never met in real life but talked online. Steve is part of my friend group and will not be leaving the friend group. The reason I never met him in person is that he has agoraphobia

The other day my roommate and I were cooking and the chicken was not properly thawed so she started stabbing it with a knife. During the process we realized how ridiculous it looked and she laughed saying I should send a picture of this to Steve as it was funny. So I did and we started talking platonically

Later that night while I was Skyping my amazing boyfriend, Steve called me which I ignored. He then texted me apologizing and that he was feeling sad and wanted to chat but forgot I had a boyfriend who may feel uncomfortable with me chatting with an ex-fwb boy. I was going to ignore it completely but toward the end of my Skype call with my boyfriend I told him about it and asked if he would be ok with me talking to him. My boyfriend did not like the fact I didn’t tell him about it right away like I was trying to hide it. I told him I wouldn’t talk to Steve if my boyfriend didn’t want me to. boyfriend said he didn’t want to tell me NOT to talk to someone but he also clearly didn’t like the idea of me talking with Steve and told me to ask my roommate to decide.

My roommate said that I am clearly a different person now and would never cheat on my boyfriend. she thought its ok to talk to Steve as long as I kept my guard up to bash any flirting

After talking it through with her and getting her ok I figured it was okay to call Steve. He answered and we had a very light nice chat. None of which was sexual. On our call I even brought up our past and he agreed it was in the past and we would never work out as an actual couple

The next day my boyfriend asked what had happened and I told him my roommate approved and I called Steve. He then got very upset with me asking me what my motivation was for wanting to talk to Steve

From being bullied, to feeling like neither my time nor my performance is valued, I simply cannot say that I am enjoying my time being apart of this production.

I joined this community theater production over a month ago and we’re set to open the first week of September. I’ve spent my entire summer in unstructured rehearsals that often end in some sort of build up of frustration amongst the cast that have left me in tears most nights. Yesterday I nearly quit. I arrived over 3 hours early to the theater because of a miscommunication and wasn’t able to eat for until rehearsal ended seven hours later, after run through after run through of choreography. If you can call it choreography. When we’re not just “bopping” or “wingin’ it” in the background (as the choreographer likes to say), my dancing partner isn’t there because we’ve never had perfect attendance or the choreography has been changed for the tenth time and we’re relearning it even near the end of production! I’ve been in ensembles before, but never have I felt so worthless in comparison to the named characters. I try to stay positive, I really do. But when all I hear is whispering from the cast about how shitty the show is I can’t help but feel so low. I don’t feel like my time is really valued, nor like I belong. I drove home last night feeling so frustrated and upset. Theater is supposed to be my escape. My therapist from years ago was the person who ushered me into my first audition, knowing I loved music and performance. Plays and musicals are supposed to make me feel happy, but all I’ve done recently is felt the opposite, and it’s all because of a musical. I’m at the end of my rope. I can’t take another hungry, stress-filled day. But I feel like I’d be a shitty person for giving up so close to opening, even if I am just a lowly ensemble member.

1640,"WIBTA if I quit the independent movie I'm directing? Worst case I strand the cast and crew in the middle of New Mexico and my family loses money. Best case I don't go insane. It's always been my dream to be a film director. Two years ago I basically was inspired by Christopher McCandless and did a solo trip across the US and Mexico. In a tiny little town on the border I met this old guy named ""Birdman"" who's life story was so fascinating I wrote a screenplay based on his life freehand in about a week. 

It took me two years but I took out tons of credit cards, my family invested an so actually have a few hundred thousand to work with. We are presently shooting across New Mexico and  I have a somewhat professional film crew, actors and film equipment I've rented. It's cost a fortune and at this point we are so over budget it's not even funny. 

Well I'm realizing now ""Birdman"" is a fucking liar. And almost nothing he told me two years ago happened. He insisted on playing himself which I agreed to but he argues with me about the way things happened and whether things happened (for example he claimed he was in the first Iraq war and won the Medal of Honor, truth he wasn't even in the military).  He has almost zero camera presence so I have to carefully ""shoot around"" him even though he's the focus of the movie. He also ""accidentally"" walked in our lead actress changing several times so she quit (reshoots=$$$) and now her replacement is probably sleeping with Birdman creating more potential drama when he pisses her off. 

This morning is typical. We were supposed to start at 3AM so we could get establishing shots of the sunrise over the mountains. Birdman got everyone drunk last night (all his pay, he's going to want an advance when I see him) and no one showed up. We lost a morning or shooting and I still have to pay for food and hotels for today. Like I said, typical for this shoot.

I want DD the cast and crews pay up to today, take my credit card off the hotel and just drive the fuck away today. I'm so frustrated.

1642,"AITA for not wanting to go to an engagement party and wedding? Ok AITA i need a judge

Relevant Information: 

I have met the best friend and her fiance a total of two times. For a couple of hours each. There has been no effort on either side to fix this as they live a few hours away. We are essentially strangers despite my gf and I dating for a year and a half.
 
The story:

My gf told me her bestie got engaged and that she was going to be Maid of Honor. I was excited for her knowing that she wanted this to happen and glad it came to be for her.  She then told me we'd been invited to the house warming and engagement party and she was okay with me not going, but i was warned I had to go to the wedding.  

I replied that I didn't want to go to the house/engagement party  as I barely know who these people are, and have little association with them let alone their actual network of friends and family. I also explained that while this could be used as an attempt to get to know them, that doing so when they have an entire house of families and friends it was super stupid  timing.  I'd get a few minutes of conversation, then be forced to walk around and attempt to mingle with strangers who i have no connection to.  

It didn't feel like an appropriate time for me to be there. (The gf would be there but mostly  acting as assistant host, catering to everyone and making sure things went smoothly as she's a very close friend, so i wouldn't be socializing around with her to introduce me around as she's busy. )

When she said that's okay  we still have the  wedding, I resisted again. I reminded her that she is the maid of honor, and I'm just her boyfriend. Not only will she be busy running errands and setting up for the wedding(which i have zero doubt I'd be roped into doing as well), but as part of the wedding party she's supposed to be with the best man for all of well...all of it. I don't have a spot in things aside from guest.

 She has to sit at the table with the wedding party and everything else during the reception, and yes we could dance after all the official first dance stuff is out of the way, but she still will be going around making sure the event goes off without a  hitch to even have time to do more than one or two dances. 

While the wedding is going on, ill be shuffled around to wherever for seating which inconveniences the bride and grooms plans, and yet again stuck with dozens of people i don't know. Same at the reception. 

Closing thoughts:

I feel like since i don't know the people it shouldn't be expected of me to come to these things even if i am dating the maid of honor.

1645,"AITA Pregnant coworker hates my cologne Years ago I was working in an office, and the two women sitting in front of me were pregnant. These were the first three desks next to the entrance. The first and me were in the same department, as were the other twenty or so people around us. The pregnant coworker in front of me wasn't, but refused to change when they moved her department to our back. Lets call her PC for Pregnant Coworker.

One morning I receive a message from PC asking if I'm wearing cologne. This was the first time I ever interacted with her because she didn't even replied to my ""good morning"" and I was puzzled by her typing instead of talking. It went like this:

Me: Em...Yes. Why?

PC: I don't like the smell. 

Me: Oh, I'm sorry.

PC: Can you stop using it? You can use it on the weekends.

Me: Mm, I have another cologne, maybe I can use that one.

PC: I don't like that one either.  

Me: Sorry, I'm not going to stop using cologne. 

PC: Then you can change desks with someone. 
 
I asked everyone in the department and no one accepted. She also refused to move to her department with my help moving her things. 

I didn't stop using cologne.

I understand she was pregnant and sensitive to smells, and even with her attitude I tried to help, but I worked on sales, and in a subtropical climate, cologne was basic. Not to most of my coworkers, though. 

To be honest if the other pregnant woman had asked me, I would have stopped, or at least carried it with me so when clients came I could use it, but this woman was rude and ate smelly breakfasts at her desk.

This brought everyone against me as a person who disrespects the dead and a complete asshole. All I did was state my view on the matter. So, am I the asshole?

1654,"AITA for expecting my brother's business to pay me while watching our sick mother? My brother is a multi millionaire, he owns his own business he is known for being a tightwad. I am a retired government employee, He offered me a part time job as a tech consultant for his company, salary based on 3 days per week was the agreement so the pay is the same if I work 4 hours or 9 hours. I do not get any benefits, however he has paid me on some holidays if he was feeling generous. The only true critical part of my job is that I make the bank deposit at the end of the day, typically one day a week or up to three days a week if he is not there, if neither of us are there he has to pay his secretary OT to do the deposit. (she comes in at 5am, we close when the last truck arrives could be 3 could be 7 just depends.)

Recently our 85 year mother got sick, I took her to the hospital. Visiting hours are 9am to 9pm, for the week she was in the hospital I was there at 9am to 9pm, most days he would relieve me for 3-4 hours in the afternoon. I knew that since he was not at work someone else would have to do the deposit, I offered to take care of the deposit on several occasions, he said no, the secretary offered to stay and do it.

I took mom home from the hospital,(she was too weak to get out of bed without help) The hospital suggested someone take FMLA to stay with her.  I stayed with her the first 24 hours, the next few days he relieved me, but only for 4 hours or so I still spent the night. The 4th day he was going to watch her all day, but then said he needed to meet his architect to talk about a deck being built at his vacation home and that he could not be there until noon, that is today we will see what happens.

On payday I found that I had no paycheck, nothing. AITA for thinking that by brother could have paid me something even though I have no benefits even a partial paycheck, knowing that I offered to come to work and he told me no? I feel like he should have appreciated that stayed with mom 75% of the time compared to his 25%, which allowed him to stay at work and do what he needed to do, he did benefit from me being with mom it allowed him to do his work, and in the end he or his company actually saved the cost of my paycheck, so not only did I not get paid he profited for it. If I had a government job I would have had sick time, or FMLA to still get paid during this period. I am not expecting to be paid for watching my mom, that is my responsibility as son, But I would have appreciated getting paid for the fact that had I not spent those long hours with mom, he would have had to step away from his work to do his share, and I offered to come to work, had he said sure he will watch mom, so I could go to work I would have had a paycheck.

Please do not make this about my mother, that is not the issue here, I would have stayed with her no matter what and done whatever it takes to see her get better, this is about me dedicating more time to her than my brother so that his personal/business life was not impacted as much as mine.","YTA for expecting it when it wasn't discussed ahead of time.

He came and spoke to me at a party with some others (probably because I was standing alone) and we talked for a bit and then he just left. His friends stayed but he went. He said he would be right back but he didn't come back. We didn't speak for long, but I felt a  connection to him. We had a lot in common and I wanted to speak to him more. 

So I searched up one of the friends names on Facebook (it had been said earlier), went through it, and found him in their friends list. His account was semi public, so you could see some photos and old posts, but not all for some reason. I scrolled for a bit and I learned some things about him without even meaning to. Then I requested some people on the previous friend's list and hoped they'd be friends with him too, and eventually a few accepted (I will admit I did join some's Facebook groups and talk to them in there so they would accept) and then we eventually had mutual friends! So then after a week of this I requested him. He accepted it. I messaged him asking if he was the guy at the party and said how much of a coincidence it is we already had mutual friends and he showed up as a suggestion for me to add (maybe this lie wasn't very good, no). He said yes and we started talking. I watched his favourite shows and listened to his music so we'd have something in common too (I DID legitimately enjoy them, I didn't lie) We then just started talking, he asked me on a date, and now we've been in a great relationship for 8 months.

Tomorrow is when my friend an I are presenting ours. Out presentation needs to include 6 different points. I won’t bore you with all of the topics, but all you need to know is one is theme.

The quick and simple of it is that we're new roommates, been splitting a house assigned by the school (we each have private room and bath, we share hte kitchen and living space; we did not pick each other) for two weeks thus far. Her friend, who lives in the same setup nearby, is over constantly. They wait until 9-10 PM to cook dinner and talk loudly throughout. The house is a square, there is no hallway, no way to get ""away"" from the kitchen noise. Kitchen and living room noise happens on the exact opposite side of the wall from my bed.

I sleep early to wake up and work out. (When I do so, I am hyper-aware of noise and light and try to sneak out since I know she's sleeping.) I've told her this, and asked her if she and her friend can strive to be quiet after 8 PM, since I usually go to bed around 8:45-9 PM.

1658,"AITA for getting mad at a friend for talking about her relationship as I was going through a breakup? This has been weighing on my mind for the past few days concerning a friend who lives far away so our friendship is primarily through texts and phone calls.

I went through a breakup (while also going through work issues that compounded my stress) a month and a half ago and cried to my friend about it on the phone that very night after it happened. I was so upset and cried myself to sleep.

The next morning, I woke up to some texts from her saying how she said ""I love you"" to her boyfriend but he didn't say it back and said something about how he'll say it when he's ready and she was worried about it. They have been dating since March/April.

I kinda blew up at her and texted her saying that I found her texts very hurtful because it was not even 24 hrs after my breakup and I didn't really want to hear about a relationship problem, especially one where the issue was he didn't say ""I love you"" yet. I just found her texts massively insensitive in light of what I was going through.

She responded and blew up at me, saying that as her friend, I should be less selfish and a good friend and hear out her concerns/problems in her life regardless of what is going on in my life. That I probably don't like her boyfriend since I never want to talk about him.

I told her that I don't mind hearing out any of her other problems or anything besides relationship issues because I was going through a breakup that occurred not even a day ago. And I recalled a text conversation where she had asked if I cared if she talked about her boyfriend because she was bringing him up a lot and I said no, that I was happy for her, and sent a screenshot of that to her.

She subsequently said that she needs some space and will get back to me when she is in a better mental space and we haven't spoken to each other since then.

But recently, she reached out to me about 2 weeks ago, saying that she feels better now and that a lot has changed in the past few weeks and she wants to tell me about it and told me what days she would be available to talk.

I haven't responded because I don't know what to say and I've been busy with work and traveling. I had honestly forgotten about all of this and just worked on moving on from my breakup and getting work stuff settled for the past month and a half.

I'm feeling much better now with everything so I'm also a little scared that if I respond, I might feel as terrible as I did before again.

When I get home I’m on child care duty until I go to bed. I also have to do the dishes and vacuum, and the laundry. And any maintenance that needs doing. I work on Saturdays. On sundays I end up doing childcare and chores all day. I’m the only one that cooks. I don’t actually know what my wife does all day considering I do 90% of all the chores. 

Tonight I finally got fed up and made her do evening care for once in her life. The last time I actually got a break was before she gave birth.

1668,"AITA for suggesting a 'curfew' for my boyfriend? My (21f) boyfriend (21m) and I have been together for four years. We are about to move out together, after basically living with my parents for 18 months or so.

&#x200B;

We have discussed potential compromises (chores, house decorations etc.) and are agreed on 99% of things. We made an agreement for him to be home between 21:30 and 22:00 on a weekday. Weekends wouldn't necessarily have a time, this is just so it is more of a compromise. The issues I have don't go away on the weekends, but I'm more likely to see my friends and family on the weekend too. This would also exclude anomalies, like concerts or family meals etc. But, as a basis, 21:30 is an agreed upon time for him to be home, with 22:00 being used as a buffer for traffic or losing track of time. His friends have told me I'm being controlling and abusive by expecting this from him.

&#x200B;

The reason this is even an issue is because I have pretty bad anxiety about being on my own. My parents once left me home alone, and I couldn't handle it and had to stay with someone else. I had a rough childhood, which has left me with almost consistent feelings of anxiety. I don't mind being alone during the day, but when the sun starts to set, it's like a switch within me that makes me instantly anxious. He knows this, and he knows my past, whereas his friends don't.

&#x200B;

There will be times where this isn't relevant, if I want to go and see family, or my friends, but the simple fact is that I don't have as many friends as he does. I sometimes see his friends, but whenever I am around them, it is made abundantly clear that they are his friends, and not mine, and so I try and avoid them.

&#x200B;

We are due to move out next week, and it is making me feel awful that they think I am controlling him. The last thing that I would ever want is to control him. From my perspective, it is agreed upon, and actually suggested by him, as he wants to better his routine. I would never force him into doing this if he hadn't agreed on it. But, when I made this point to his friends, they said the only reason he agreed to it is because he feels bad for me because I don't see my friends as often as he does. This isn't the case at all; I like the fact that he is close to his friends, because he has a relationship with them that I can't fulfil (I really do not know how to play FIFA). I also prefer to not have many friends, as I'm a massive introvert.

&#x200B;

Another issue also comes from the fact that my best friend is a guy that I dated in high school. I have no feelings for him, and my boyfriend knows this, but I know he doesn't necessarily trust him. So, if every time my boyfriend wanted to stay out late, I had my friend over, it would seem as though I'm 'punishing' him. Or that's what his friends said it would seem like. I of course would not be punishing him.

Some time ago I got to know a girl at a monthly anime fan meetup I go to (just to get in touch with other fans, talk about what you're watching, someimes we do cosplay stuff). She seemed like a nice girl and reminded me a bit of myself when I was fifteen. We got talking and later she asked me if she could have my number because she thought I was nice and it would be cool to have someone to chat with. I never had many friends, let alone friends who were in the same things as me so I thought maybe it was the same for her which is why I agreed. 

We saw each other again on the next meetup. I somehow mentioned how I had only recently gotten a Switch and what games I had for now, e.g. Smash but that my girlfriend wasn't into games so she didn't play it with me.

Mikey's mom is a nice lady, but she's super spacey and she's a little bit of a grifter. We have days when, say, school is out or the weekend, where one of us sends our son over for the day. When I send Jimmy to her house I send him with his own food, ten bucks in case of incidentals or outing, and a change of clothes and shoes. If he stays overnight I pack enough food for him so she doesn't have to feed him. When she sends Mikey to my house she never packs anything for him. He's a growing boy so he eats me out of house and home when he comes over, if he stays the night he ends up in my son's pajamas, he never has his own toys. And it's almost always him coming to us. My son is hardly ever invited over. They aren't in a bad financial situation, but they aren't rich. Like us they're just normal people. Not rich, not poor.

My son's birthday just passed and I arranged for him and four friends to go see a movie and have dinner afterward. I didn't ask the other parents to pay for their own kids, it was gonna be my treat, but three of the others parents insisted on at least paying for the movie ticket since it's costly to go to the movies in our area. Mikey's mom called and said she was really sorry but Mikey would be unable to go, she couldn't afford a movie ticket. I told her I understood and that we'd try to get the boys together later on. She kept saying ""Mikey would love to go, but...we just can't afford it"" in a tone that suggested I should pay for him. ""Mikey really wants to go, he's so disappointed, Jimmy's his best friend, but...we just can't afford it.""

It made me a little annoyed because I'm always taking care of her son, paying for things. She invites her son along to things because ""the boys are best friends and they'd have so much fun"". I know I need to grow a backbone and tell her to buzz off but my son has so few friends and he and Mikey get along so well, they're practically brothers at this point.

I told Mikey's mom, again, that I was sorry Mikey couldn't come but the boys would get together soon and ended the call.  The next day at school the boys who were able to go and my son naturally told everyone about their fun night out, as little kids tend to do, and later on I got several angry texts from Mikey's mom calling me an asshole for not just paying for her son to go to the movies because now ""he's having to listen to the boys go on and on and he didn't get to go and he knows he didn't get to go because Jimmy invited him"", etc.

1681,"WIBTA if I report my primary care doctor for his poor on-call doctor/phone staff? Yesterday I went to my primary care doctor for a spider bite I was worried may get infected. 
They saw me promptly and gave me a good diagnoses/prescription (antibiotics) for the spider bite.

&nbsp;

(Here is where I mess up) On my way home from work I took out the trash and I accidentally threw out my prescription. 
  
&nbsp;

I called my primary care immediately at 3:00 pm. They are closed but have a on-call doctor hotline. 

&nbsp;

I get through and leave a message with the receptionist and she tells me the on-call doctor will call me back shortly. 

Two hours pass by. I call the on-call doctor line again, same thing.

Three hours pass by. I call the on-call doctor line again and tell them CVS closes within one hour and I need this prescription. The nurse practitioner who saw me earlier in the day told me if my spider bite went untreated I would of needed intravenous antibiotics. I explained this politely even though they have been rude to me from the start.

&nbsp;

She tells me it's Friday night and people do things. I tell her I called them originally at 3:00 pm which is two hours before  business closing hours. She told me there is nothing she can do.

&nbsp;

I them ask them, ""What is the point of a on-call doctor who isn't on-call? What about the other doctors at my primary care, can you contact one of them?"". She again stated there is nothing she can do.

&nbsp;
I hang up and call the medical group they are part of. I explain the situation to their customer service and she tells me she'll absolutely help me. 

&nbsp;

Ten minutes before my CVS closes, I get the call from my primary care doctor (the owner) and get the prescription refilled. 
He was  condescending to me and seemed to try and guilt trip me he was at his nieces wedding. I didn't say anything but thanks for getting me the prescription. 


&nbsp;

**I have a few major concerns that I think may warrant me reporting the practice:**

1. The only reason I got my prescription refilled was because I was diligent with trying to get their on-call hotline to do their job and willing to take it a step further. Someone who doesn't want to deal with confrontation may have let the whole situation go. This could have result in major problems depending on their medical needs.
2. I always had the option to go to a urgent care, which I was about to do. However I would of needed to spend between $150.00 to $300.00 for a prescription refill. I am fortunate that a cost of that amount isn't a huge deal for me. For someone else though, depending on their lives/health insurance an extra $150.00 or more expense could be a very big deal.

Essentially I am considering reporting the practice because I worry about someone in a less fortunate or bigger medical emergency than I had going through the same thing.

1684,"AITA telling my friend that his girlfriend slept with someone else. So just to start off I'll state my bias: I personally think that this particular relationship needs to end as it's become so incredibly toxic for various reasons which I wont go into but needless to say their behaviour has not been good. Now that that is out of the way on to the story.

One of my friends has been in a relationship with this girl for nearly 3 years and in that time she's become good mates with all of his mates. In the last year or so however they've been having a lot of trouble. He's very very flirty with everyone and especially when he's had a few, but he's has never been unfaithful, which is an understandable issue to her.  She then breaks up with him and her reasons were that she couldn't trust him. They then very quickly got back together for a couple months and she broke up with him again for the exact same reason.

I then hear through the rumour mill that she slept with someone else about 1 week after the second break up. I asked her about it and she confessed and asked me not to tell him cause she promised to me (and my flatmate who found out independently) that she would tell him soon. Obviously they weren't officially together but still not the nicest thing to do. Fast forward about a month and she's been staying at his house for the last week and it seems that they are back together again. This continues for another 3 months or thereabouts. 

Turns out shes going through a rough patch with her family and the first thing she did was go back to him which seems to me like using him as an emotional crutch as she was adamant that she didn't want to be with him before this all happened. Its then been about 6 months since the 2nd break up

One night my friend comes to stay at my house and while we're chatting he brings her up and says how things are going great again and he thinks they'll be completely back together soon and goes on like this for a while, I quickly realise from his story that he still has no idea what she did and that she's essentially sworn one of his best mates to secrecy on a promise of honesty that she never kept. 

I felt like I couldn't just sit there knowing what I know with him talking about how great things were going, and so I told him. He was understandably very upset but seemed to take it quite well. Now things *seem* to be fine with them again but she is very unhappy with me for telling him and I worry that she'll affect his opinion of me because of it. 

So in all this: am I the asshole for telling him?","YTA

They weren't together, so not only is it not your business, it's not even his business.

Plus, trying to break up a relationship you see is toxic is a B-movie plot, not something a grown adult does. As long as it's not violent or she isn't getting him into heroin it's not really your place to have any influence on who he decides to date",1,YTA,0.0,0.0,0
1685,"WIBTA If I told my friend off for talking behind my back to my ex gf? Hey all, so I’ve been thinking about this scenario for some time as it already happened and I’m not sure if my response was right.

Context: I *had* :( a gf for about 2-3 months before we broke up because she didn’t want anything serious. It was pretty stupid as I was fully committed and was broken down pretty bad when she announced our split. My friend lets call ‘Kyle’ and my ex gf ‘Karen’. So Kyle and GOD DAMN KAREN were already good friends before I came in, so in and out they were always chatting each other up from time to time. Now KYLE THE LOUD MOUTH has pretty good social skills I must say, but he will literally talk about anything just to strike up a convo with you. Literally. “Oh, u/Reddit-Demi-God so how have u been with KAREN lately?” (After the split) Me: ...Bruh. Also, this is a high school scenario and Karen and I didn’t leave on good terms.

The Scenario: So my friend Kyle and I always hang out in the library to read books and talk about business (yea I’m a nerd, sue me). And somehow I don’t know how, like It was just 100% coincidence like there was no way it could’ve happened unless someone brought it up??!!! My relationship with Karen is now the topic of the convo. Now, we’re kind of close Kyle and I, but only when I vent about things. So we talk yap yap and then he tells me that he asked Karen why she broke up with the Demi-God himself and she just says “Why can’t I”. He literally asked her that without my permission just to strike up a convo with her, well knowing that we didn’t leave on good terms. So I responded, whatever she’s the past now. Then it happens a second time and this time she gets a little frustrated that Kyle keeps bringing me up so now she’s mad at me? To the point where she would 100% ignore my existence. I gave a speech to my class willingly one time and I could see that she was trying to look away. Shame. 

My Response: At first I was annoyed that he kept on mentioning me to my ex which caused her to hate me more, even when I’ve done nothing wrong and it wasn’t my fault. Then I weighed the losses and my initial thought was that my friendship with Kyle is more valuable than with Karen because I don’t even talk to Karen, and Kyle is my only library buddy so would I rather brush it off and still have a library buddy or tell Kyle off and put a dent in the friendship? I decided to keep my mouth shut and continue reading, but from the back of my mind for the rest of the day I wondered why the hell would he do such a thing?

Regardless, if Kyle mentions me to Karen again I’d tell him that the topic is private and he shouldn’t be discussing it so directly. So, I’m stuck in with a fork in the road. Oh wise redditors, WIBTA?

1686,"AITA for telling a bullied friend he has no idea what he's talking about? I have a very close friend group made up of the sort-of outsiders kinda people. Some of us are part of the LGBT community in a conservative school, some come from very poor or abusive backgrounds, some have incredibly unstable home lives, some are foster kids. It's small, and we all feel safe and open with each other because we know everyone here has seen and been through some shit. We take care not to hit each other's triggers or be too assholeish-like one girl has issues with sex, so we don't make lewd jokes as it tends to set her off on panic attacks.

One of my friends has had some serious problems with bullying. His tormentors haven't physically attacked him, but he's been degraded and has anxiety and body issues due to it. Sometimes he stutters because his anxiety is so high. He's one of my best friends, and normally I'd always have his back, but the other day he was listening to some song about being invisible and there was a lyric about wishing all they had was sticks and stones. He specifically picked out that lyric to be like yeah, people don't get how words are so much worse.

Now, I'm one of the kids from an abusive background (now in the foster system, in a safe house). It was some pretty difficult and terrible years, though, and I don't think this kid knows what he's talking about since he's never had to hide bruises or lie to an ER doctor about a broken bone. You want people to stop treating you like shit, then sure, I do too. But believe me, you don't want them to beat you like shit instead. I told him he doesn't know what he's talking about and that's ridiculous to say, and he started his stutter (which made me feel bad) and left. A few of the others said I was out of line since I know how anxious he is and how much he's been hurt, and he doesn't need it from me too.

But I still think he had no idea what he was saying, and it was a bit insensitive to talk about wishing people used sticks instead of words in front of an abuse victim. AITA for saying something?

We became quite close during the first year but then he, out of nowhere, changed schools at the beginning of our second year and we didn't manage to stay in touch (no cold blood).

I'm only 5'0'' so you can image how he looks to me.

So when I was about 19, I used my life savings to buy a piece of shit car that eventually shit out on me 3 years later. I don't know whether or not my dad felt bad about allowing me to buy such a shitty car but he offered to buy me a new one. The thing is it was an almost brand new Honda, which we took a loan out for and he eventually paid off for me. 

I was always very appreciative of the car, but to be honest it's always been a huge burden. I am not a super organized person, while my father is, and every time he would see my car he'd berate me for ""not taking care of it"". I dealt with that for a while, took the car with me when I moved across the country and then drove it back when I moved home recently.

 I live about an hour from NYC, and am planning on moving out there soon. As most people know, owning a car in NYC is a pain in the ass, and I am realizing I should probably sell it.  I checked the Kelly Blue Book price and it's still worth about 6 grand, which would give me a ton of breathing room with expenses.

I play ALOT of video games on the PS4 so much so that I play everyday after work. I dont have alot of social interaction outside of work so I tend to make alot of meaningful connections online through communities and so on. I met this amazing girl over 7 months ago (We'll call her Frost) and we hit it off! We've become the best of friends! We game together everyday after work and have SO much fun.

Recently, Frost introduced a new guy into the mix (we'll call him Buck) that is apparently her old ""best friend"" saying that Buck was going through depression and hard times and she really needed to be there for him. So of course! it wasn't an issue, I invited him to our games everytime he was online. The moment Buck would hop in party chats he would joke that he was depressed and was going to hurt himself. That he had guns loaded and ready to end it all, leaving Frost devastated. He would purposely alienate himself so that she had no choice but to stop playing with others and only join him. It's been very hard to fake a laugh or enjoy ourselves when the moment Buck joins the energy is literally sucked right out

Its gotten so bad that I purposely hide offline so that I won't be invited to their group and have to hear it. This has continued for the past 2 months and I finally have had enough of it. I want to tell her I want nothing to do with Buck and I will no longer talk to her if she continues bringing him around but I'm afraid I'll lose her in the process. WIBTA?","YTA. For two reasons.

1. Strictly based on what you've said, from her perspective, you're going from 0 to I won't talk to you anymore if you don't do what I say. Have you even tried talking about your feelings regarding Buck with her first? An ultimatum is never a good way to start a conversation, certainly not when the person you're talking to hasn't done anything wrong. Even ignoring a moral opinion on it, you're introducing your problem as an attack rather than a conversation, which puts her in a defensive position. And holding your relationship hostage. If it's your backup plan, that's one thing, it shouldn't be your opening move. ""Do X or I'm done with you"" is terrible to hear from someone you care about.

2. Ending a friendship because you don't like their friend is just a dick thing to do period. Saying ""I want nothing to do with Buck."" is fine, you're not obligated to keep toxic people in your life, and you didn't even know him beforehand. But what part of not talking to him means you can't talk to her? It comes across like you just want to monopolize her time, and aren't cool with her spending time with him even if you're not there. This is, again, assuming you haven't talked about it at all with her first, as your post doesn't say you have. Now if you have tried cutting Buck out before, made that clear to her, and she just refuses to respect that and brings him into your chats anyway, it's a different story.",1,YTA,0.0,0.0,1
1702,"AITA for expecting someone to pay for damage caused by their pets while under my care? A friend of a friend was being forced by their landlord to get rid of two rabbits that they had in their apartment. My friend contacted me and I decided I would help this person out. The rabbit lived in my room for a month. During this time, I would feed them twice a day, refill their water bottle, and clean out their their cage/litter on weekends. I was encouraged to let the rabbits out of their cage sometimes, so that they could have a larger space to walk in, but was instructed to keep an eye on them, so that they didn't bite anything. Before letting the rabbits out, I would always make sure there were no chords of any kind, so that they wouldn't ruin any electronics I had lying around. One thing I was not aware of is that they would chew on the baseboards of my room.

During one evening, I let them out into the room while I was working on my laptop. I was listening to some music and very focused on my work. After I was finished, I had forgotten I let them out and found that they had made some noticeable bite marks on several of my base boards. For some reason, and I cannot fathom why, I did not tell the owner about this in the moment. It might have been because I thought my landlord might let this slide, but even still, I think this was my biggest mistake.

Anyways, the rabbits came and went in a month. The owner put them up for adoption shortly after we gave them back. Fast forward 8 months, I am finally ready to move out of my apartment. The landlord sees the bite marks and says that she would deduct it from my security deposit. Since she trusts me quite a bit, I told her I could fix the marks and she said that, if I fixed it, then my security deposit would be safe.

I did fix the bite marks and the materials cost was $26. I contact the owner of the rabbits and send him a message explaining the situation and saying:

""I was hoping, since this was an accident that happened because I was taking care of your rabbits, that you could pay for the materials I used to fix the baseboards. You obviously don't have to and I wont fault you for refusing, but it would be nice of you.""

His response:

""I'll put this as nicely as I can, \_\_\_\_\_\_. You should have brought this up last summer, when it happened, or at the very least when I came to pick them up. I might've felt more sympathetic then.

1703,"AITA for not staying with my friend even though I had planned to and she changed her schedule for me? This year has been tough, my BF I are staying with his parents. We’ve both been looking for new jobs and money is tight.

A few months ago, BF had an interview and was offered a job in the city where my friend from college, Katie, lives. 

We were both thrilled. I had also wanted to go to an event there, and once BF was told he got the job, I purchased a ticket, figuring we’d move by the time of the event .

A week later, higher ups at the company called. The guy who offered him the job was demoted, and they could no longer offer BF the job.

But I still really wanted to go to this event so I used miles and booked a flight. I planned to fly in Thurs and leave Mon. I had sleeping arrangements already for Fri/Sat. So I asked Katie if I could crash on her couch for Thurs and Sun night. She said yes, and decided she would take off work that Friday so we could hang. 

Fast forward I’m on my flight. Katie tells me she’s sick, dizzy, coughing, she’s going to the ER. I ask her to keep me updated and if she needs me to come get her or something when I land, I will. The ER tells her she has a severe bacterial infection in her inner ears. 

More backstory: Last year I caught a bacterial infection, my tonsils are garbage so I get them fairly often but this one was really bad. I was sick for close to 6 months. I literally could not get out of bed most days, I was miserable. I have severe sleep apnea and I couldn’t sleep with my cpap mask bc of the infection, so my sleep quality was poor, which prolonged it more.

After literally 4 courses of antibiotics, I slowly got better. However, my dr told me that my tonsils need to come out to prevent further infections/help stop my sleep apnea. Until then, I needed to be cautious of getting sick. 

I told Katie I know this is last minute but I’m worried about getting sick, and I don’t know if I can stay with you. She told me she wasn’t contagious, and “the only way I could catch her infection is if I drank the fluid in her inner ears.” I reminded her how sick I was last year, and that I can’t get sick right now - not only because of me but also BF’s dad has cancer and I would feel terrible if I brought home an illness.I did use a mask & sanitizer on the plane.

Katie that she isn’t contagious. I asked how she could be 100% sure and she said she just knows bc she’s had bacterial infections before. 

I decided that I would get a cheap hotel for but we would get lunch on Friday. That way I wouldn’t be in a confined space with her in her apartment. She texted me verbatim, “ok, but if you say one more word about being scared of getting sick, I will strangle you bc I’m not fucking contagious!” 

The next morning, I ask if we can have lunch at the hotel restaurant so I don’t have to ride in her car.

She initially agrees but then went off, saying that I am a terrible friend and all my problems, I brought upon myself and I shouldn’t be traveling. She said she took off work for me, and rearranged her life for me.

I said okay, don’t worry. I’ll look it up and let you know. 

I was expecting the boots to be unwearable. Once we went over to pick our daughter up, I saw that they were still wearable - one side looked bad but still wearable. My MIL mentioned that she wanted to give the damaged boots to my SIL for my niece to have to play in. I’m not totally sure how I responded but I was a bit hesitant to agreeing with it. We left and she gave me cash to buy a new pair of boots. (The boots are expensive for a toddler ~$50. I had gotten them with a discount code but she gave me the full price. I asked if she wanted me to wait until I found a code, she said no.)

When I got home and thought about it and I thought it was strange that I was required to give the old pair of boots away. I talked to my sister and she agreed. I decided that just because my MIL was paying for a new pair, I didn’t have to give up the old pair. We could keep wearing them until my daughter outgrows. My thinking here was that if my niece was older, there wouldn’t be a conversation about giving away the boots, we’d have a new pair and the damaged pair.

I've been friends with this group for many years. Back when I first knew them, one friend accidentally drank out of my water bottle when we went camping. I tried to stop her but didn't make it in time. Since then, I've shared many drinks over the years with her and other people in this friend group, and I've never told anyone that I had the herpes virus. In the beginning, it was because I didn't want the friend who drank from my bottle to get mad at me for not telling her (since we were still new friends back then). Later on, I felt like I missed the boat on telling them (if we've shared so many drinks already over the years, what's the point of telling them now?)

Since we've always been pretty casual about sharing drinks and straws, eventually I thought that they didn't care all that much. Cold sores are pretty common, so maybe they have it already. But recently, I found out that at least one friend does care, and she cares a lot. We were talking one day and somehow the topic of herpes was raised up. One friend started talking about how cold sores are herpes too, and how she's really careful about sharing cups and straws with people, but ""you guys are okay because I trust that you don't have it"" (mind you, the girl who said this is not the same girl who drank out of my water bottle back in the day). Other people agreed with her. I felt like I was gonna die from guilt, but didn't have the courage to admit I had it. Some of my friends will probably get really mad that I never told them after all these years, and I don't want to risk losing these friends.

AITA for not telling them that I've had cold sores in the past?","NTA. 

This is from the [UK Herpes Virus Association](https://herpes.org.uk/cold-sores/) :

“ Cold sores are only caught by direct skin contact, with the affected area. They are not caught through sharing cups, cutlery, towels, lipstick, etc. (unless there is warm pus on the item).  Experts are definite about this, though this fact is sometimes ignored by unreliable sources on the Internet and elsewhere. “

My daughter drove the entire trip, about 50 miles each way including a good amount of highway driving, with the e-brake on. This was a dumb mistake, I know, though I did point out to my sister that she should have explained better how to take the parking brake on and off before allowing my daughter to drive the car. My sister brought the car to the mechanic and according to the mechanic there was $900 worth of damage caused by the driving with the brake on. My sister demanded that I pay for it, since my daughter doesn’t have a job and I’m responsible for her. However, I thought the $900 quoted was completely ridiculous and that driving with the e-brake on, even for a couple of hours on the highway, isn’t going to cause that amount of damage. I said fine, I’ll pay, but first I requested that she go to my trusted mechanic for a second opinion. She said she’s not going to go to my “buddy” who might cut corners as a favor to me, a characterization I was really offended by.

I work at a theatre that just opened up a bar, and the employee that was hired to work as the bartender (and the bar manager) first trained as a regular theater attendant (i.e ripping tickets, working concessions). In our handbook, it states that employees are not allowed to wear hip-hugging slacks or have visible piercings. This particular employee has both; her slacks are always skin tight and she has a nostril piercing.

When I first started and read the handbook, I took out any visible piercings and let them close up, and I bought slacks that were form fitting but didn't show off my curves. Because it was what was on the handbook! You are supposed to follow those rules if you want to continue working at the place.

I asked another coworker about it and she said I was being a little unreasonable, stating that the bartender can't really help if she fills out slacks more than me (which seemed kind of mean?) and that if a manager hasn't said anything, it shouldn't matter.

1711,"AITA for not telling my friend that her boyfriend has been cheating on her? My good friend Tina (not her real name) has been in an on-and-off relationship with this guy for 5 years. According to her he's her first true love and she can never fully forget him.
They have broken up too many times and at one point it became so bad that she had to seek professional help because she was depressed.

Last year they got back together again, which made me fly off the handle and we had a huge fight about it. But there was nothing I could do. She's too much in love with the guy.
And they've been together for a year now, which is a good sign because they never lasted for a few months before. So maybe I was wrong. He has changed.

A few nights ago though, I was having dinner with another friend from work and we ran into him (he does not know me) and another girl whom my friend happens to be friends with. We introduced ourselves and my friend and the girl started exchanging remarks on what a great catch he was and how lucky the girl is. He looked smitten and pleased with himself. The girl said they have been seeing each other for a while.

I went home and almost called Tina to tell her but thought better of it. If he has indeed been cheating on her, it's best she finds out herself. She will get hurt terribly but it will be worth it if he's out for good. My sister thinks I should tell my friend if I care about her. But I think, she needs to see it for herself how he is bad for her so that she will dump him, and this time I hope, for good.

I am just so tired of all the drama and shit about this guy my friend has made me listen to all these years. She has never listened to me and always ended up getting hurt. Ths time I hope she will learn her lesson all by herself. So is it wrong that I don't tell her that her boyfriend has been cheating on her?

EDIT : I think I should be more specific why we had a big fight when they got together again.
Last time they broke up it was because she caught him lying about boys night out with his friends. Instead he went to a karaoke with a friend. He told her she was just a friend but she wouldn't listen to him since he had lied in the first place.

This guy is popular among ladies and technically a fuckboy whose charms have blinded and bewitched my friend. When they got back together I was so mad at her that I told her I didn't want her to come looking for me if he hurt her again and just to pretend it had never happened. I even pointed it out to her how he had cheated on her. Once a cheater always a cheater. She got angry accusing me of being an unsupportive bitchy friend and didn't talk to me for a month until I decided to be the bigger person and apologized to her.

This guy is an asshole. But for some reasons, she fell for him. I have tried to knock some sense into her but she always believed 'it is different this time and that he has changed' each time he came around. She knows he's a serial cheater but ignores it. Even if I told her, she would not believe me. She never did. She has never listened to me at all. So I'll take the risk if she finds out about him cheating and me knowing it. Because I have warned her many times in the past and she accused me of hating him and being an unsupportive bitchy friend.","YWBTA if you don't tell her.  Just don't expect her to be happy about it.

1712,"AITA for asking my girlfriend to accomodate my phobia? I suffer from a phobia called kosmemophobia, meaning that I find jewelry severely disgusting. I only recently learned that there was a word for that (kosmemophobia), so it was a little hard to put that disgust into rational words before - it still is. Touching jewelry is the worst, and can induce chills and nautia for me. I also find the look of jewelry ugly and excessive jewelry repulsive. 

I have tried to explain this to my girlfriend, but she doesn't really take it into consideration. I have had several episodes where I have asked my girlfriend to remove her jewelry, like remove a ring, because she wanted to hold hands, remove a neclace when she lean over me ect. ect.. She often finds it weird and would refuse to remove the jewelry - and then get mad, if I in turn refused to hold hands or similar.

I have also, tried to get her to stop wearing jewelry entirely, explaining that strongly dislike jewelry and really prefer girls are as natural as possible - stating that jewelry only negatively impact looks for me. (I never find a girl with even basic jewelry attractive)

So am I the asshole for trying to get my girlfriend to accomodate my phobia?

Ps: This is a phobia, so I cannot really explain why I feel like I do, but mostly I just find jewelry to be dirty and tacky. The harder the jewelry looks to clean, the worse the reaction - old elaborate jewelry is the worst. Touching it gives me chills and induces a light puking sensation. I know it is weird, but really, why do you feel the need to add metal glitter to your body? Work on your body instead - that shows dedication. Jewelry just shows basic wealth that 99% of the population can afford today. I cannot rationally explain my phobia, or peoples desire to wear jewelry.

1714,"AITA for calling an independent contractor (who wasn’t answering my calls) over and over again? Recently, I found myself in need of a service, and found a well-reviewed, popular independent contractor. I left him a voicemail over the weekend, and while I was working on Monday, he called my cell and left me a voicemail letting me know he has a couple spots open this week, and to give him a call back (to his cell) to book one. He said if I couldn’t call back ASAP (which I couldn’t, I was on the job), to call within a very specific, hour-long time window which was the only remaining part of the workday he’d be available to book. He promised he’d be available “any time!” during that window.

I waited until that time window (which fortunately coincided with my half hour lunch break), called him, and was disappointed to be sent to voicemail, after many unanswered rings. I really wanted to speak directly to him and get this booking over with, as I soon had to get back to work **and** I assume he fills up very quickly; those times he has for me could get snatched up pretty fast. I proceeded to call his number over and over again, letting the phone ring repeatedly until it sent me to voicemail, after which I’d hang up, call again, and do the same thing. My call record indicated that I called him 35 times during my half hour break. But he never picked up.

After work, I received an angry call back from the contractor. He told me he’d has a serious family emergency going on during the time I was calling, and that my calls drove him berserk and made the situation all the more stressful. “It’s **so** extremely rude to call someone nonstop,” he said. “Ever heard of leaving a voicemail?” He then hung up.

He called the next day to apologize and finally book me. While apologetic, he included a few playful, teasing jabs at me, like, “I’m no dating coach, but I’ve got some golden advice...don’t call a chick 35 times. You’ll get slapped with a restraining order!” But I really don’t think what I did was all that bad. He had promised he’d be available during that tie, and I didn’t want his open times snatched up, so what’s so bad about trying hard to get him on the line?

1715,"AITA for stopping my ex lovers promotion? A couple of month ago I started dating a colleague from work who was flirting with me since years. I became single recently and as he seemed to be a nice guy I gave it a try. We regularly met and he kept telling me that he likes and appriciates me and how much I mean to him. 

4 weeks ago he told me about a girl he fell in love with. Certainly I was puzzled and confronted him when he said, he never promised me anything, this was just a friends with benefits thing and I shouldn't make a drama.
In parallel, he is in the inner cycle of getting a promotion which I do not take the decision but have some strong influence on the decision making process. I always supported him as the strongest candidate and his revelation of the other girl came right at the time after the decision should have been made. But in fact, it wasn't so I used my influence to make sure somebody else gets the job. On top of that I planted the seed that he is not a reliable employee as I strongly think he only used me to get the job and shouldn't be rewarded. 

AITA for using my job to get revenge on an ex lover?

Edit:
Ok guys, it seems you need more background here.
It was not random meet ups, we saw each other 3 to 4 times a week, I was introduced to his ex wife, his kids and his friends. I was not aware he was seeing somebody else, in fact, he stated he deleted his tinder as he doesn't need to meet someone else anymore. I don't need to ask for a clarification if we are in a relationship because this is my definition of a relationship.

This all started when the possibility of the promotion came up but I didn't made any relation in the beginning because he would have not been skilled for the position anyway. So I helped him a lot with upskilling and supported him at his manager. And he was not short of reminding me to promote him.

He dumped me the day the decision was supposed to be announced, not knowing that it had been delayed for other reasons. So that was the moment I realized he used me to get the job because he was clearly not skilled for it 6 month ago. I do not see why ITA because 1. he wouldn't have gotten it without my help at all and 2. he shouldn't be rewarded for such a behavior.

I can be clearly blamed for mixing private and business and for helping him to get into the inner circle for a position he was never skilled for.

Anyways, today there was a creepy liking dude. It hard to describe but you know when your gut a a mother is just tugging at you? Yep! Parental instinct. Examples were he was dressed in all white with red underwear showing through his clothes (frickin weird). He had sunglasses on and kept staring at the children. He also spent a lot of time on his phone but his fingers weren’t swiping so I’m pretty sure he was videotaping.

I mean she's turning 19 in less than two months, dropped out of high school, still hasn't gotten her GED, has no plans to go to college, has never had a job, and refuses to learn how to drive.

Yet my grandma pities them. I get if she feels sorry for my cousin, but everyone else just yells and scream at her until they get her money and medication.

Anyways, she sold her house just to get away from all of that. For about 7 months she didn't live with them. During this time though, she was paying all their bills because she ""felt bad for selling the house"".

It took years for my mom, stepdad, and I to convince her to move away from them and after 7 months they were living with her again. It was the same thing over again. She was miserable again. I love my grandma, and when she's in poor condition it negatively effects me too.

She's moving very soon now. She's going to an apartment (that my stepdad had to co-sign on for her to get cause they ruined her credit score). She swears up and down that she's done with them.

Food has been going missing for at least a month now. It has caused several issues between everyone in the house and no one has taken responsibility. 

While at lunch with my housemate (20F), we received an aggressive text from my other housemate. The text read along the lines of “don’t touch my food! It’s all gone! Blah blah” 
I looked at (20F) and said, “this is getting out of hand, who on earth is helping themselves to everyone’s food??” 

She giggles and simply says “me”

Without taking her completely seriously we finished lunch and left. Later in the day while driving with everyone in the car, I made a joke about (20F) being the ‘food thief’

From there she starts laughing and says “has anyone noticed I haven’t gone to the grocery store in 3 weeks?” Everyone became quiet and she continued naming the food she has stolen and says “when did you guys begin to notice?”

I couldn’t believe it! I asked her how she was lying all this time and she said it was easy. She continued to explain how she lied by recalling certain events of being asked. She then told us how she was EATING my housemates baby bell cheese in her bed while my housemate yelled about it in the room next door. 

She then says, “I guess I am a klepto” and “please don’t tell the boys I do this” (we’re living with our guy friends next year). By the way she was talking she did not express any guilt/shame/remorse or embarrassment. I feel like I don’t even know who she is anymore and I’m worried about her ability to lie. 

I was never able to properly confront her because I left that afternoon for winter break and won’t be back until the fall. Because of this, she still calls me one of her best friends while I’m unknowingly creeped out by her. (She is on the lease for next year, otherwise I would just cut ties) 

also, in order to better understand her behavior: she sometimes gets weirdly sad for no reason, she doesn’t have home town friends, she has this paranoia that people don’t like her in the friend group and she is pretty insecure.

1731,"AITA for rejecting an employees vacation and being aggressive with him while doing so? Back story: I manage a team of 5 others and we have a deadline for the end of this month to finish the project were currently working on. I consider myself ""easy going"" in my management style, where I'm constantly focusing on making sure the environment is upbeat and motivational, I've never been aggressive with an employee, and I'm very easy going when it comes to vacations and leaving early, when someone spends double the allotted time at lunch, and when deadlines are missed or work isn't at the quality it should be. I like to get on a personal level with employees in hopes that it makes them like coming to work and give me their best. 

For the most part it's been working out well, but one particular employee who's good at his work (not exceptional and definitely replaceable skills, but he is a great addition to the culture) has a habit of taking 2 - 4 days off a month (at least) since the start of the year. Many times some work would be held off until he came back because he's responsible for a big portion, but nonetheless I never rejected any of his vacation requests. Even when the company owner realized he was taking so many days off, I stood up for him. I'm very aware that it is his right to request his annual leaves. With that being said, no one on the team takes half the days off he does, and still I have never made a fuss about it. 

Now this guy asks for two days off next week when he just had two days off last Sunday and Monday, which was just after the weekend (Fri and sat) which was two weeks after a week long national holiday. His reasoning is that he has an important engineering event (work he does outside of our company) and he has to be there with his team. I very aggressively shot it down and told him we have deadlines, you have a lot of tasks on your list, you just took two days off, NO. Granted, I was very aggressive in my tone because I was very angry. Fast forward two hours later he sends me a text starting with ""I didn't like your attitude"" and ending with ""it's very important for my career and my team that I be there"". I lashed back at him and again (this time with logic and a more conserved tone) and insisted that it is still rejected.

AITA?","YTA. You wouldn't have been if you'd been polite about it, but getting aggressive with him was ridiculous. It sounds like you spend so much energy trying to be the 'fun boss' that you don't give actual feedback to your employees and then lash out inappropriately. That's being a shitty boss.

Also: It SUCKS to resent someone for using their vacation days. It's part of their compensation package. Just because others don't use it doesn't mean there should be some silent agreement that we're all automatons who don't need a break. If you need more notice from him or need to be able to say no sometimes, do so professionally and politely, but don't try to guilt him into not using the time he is completely entitled to.",1,YTA,0.0,0.0,0

I've been happily married to my wife for 3 years now. We get along great and we continuously work on our communication because, as all couples do, we've had minor issues in the early stages of our marriage. A part of this is we do our best to ask each other how our days were when we get home and actively listen to things that our going on in each others lives. I know this might sound elementary, but it means a lot to my wife and me being more of an introvert I dont typically think about asking how her day was.

So anyways, yesterday I had a group of friends over, which is rare on a weekday night. We were all watching the first NFL game of the year and my wife was getting home late from work that day so everybody was already hanging out in the living room, watching the game when she got home. She super sweet so she's immediatly saying hi to all the guys and asking if they need anything, etc. So after a bit she sits on the arm of my chair and starts to talk for about 45 minutes about random pointless stories about her day.

I didnt tell her to go away or anything like that. I just kept listening and kind of showed disinterest through my one worded replies.

1746,"AITA for kicking out my nephews So I'm watching my little nephews, 10 and 6, and they're just playing fortnite in my room while I'm messing with my tablet. There's nowhere else for them to sleep besides my bed and they both have bedwetting issues so I had to think of some solution.

I take them both downstairs for water about two to three hours before I plan on putting them to sleep. Not enough to make them have a stomach ache but enough to make them piss everything out. The oldest nephew starts by taking fruit snacks that aren't his while looking at me smugly. The other nephew doesn't even ask for any, so the oldest literally tells him where it is and to take as many as they want. I know he was trying to piss me off but I told myself it wasn't fair for me to make them put it back since I wanted one too.


I start making them drink water and they just start laughing uncontrollably at some stupid shit the little nephew was saying. They also thought it was hilarious I didn't want them to piss in my bed. I'm trying to be as serious as possible telling them that if they don't drink the water I can't let them stay because I'm not letting them stain my bed just because they won't listen to me. They keep goofing around and not drinking and not listening to me and laughing in my face when I try and be serious with them and tell them to stop fucking around.

Eventually the oldest nephew tries pouring half of his cup into the other cup, a disobeyal he thinks is so funny that he spits water all over the counter and behind the fridge. I tell him to go to the office and get paper towels, specifically paper towels and specifically not toilet paper and he comes back with a roll of toilet paper.

Their bodies won’t process the water like that. They’ll need to pee around midnight from the water you have them a few hours before bed. You’re better off if you cut off water several hours BEFORE bed because they won’t have any waste to build up. If they sleep at eight, last cup of water should be at 5 with last chance to pee right before bed. Otherwise they’ll pee. But why are you letting them sleep in your bed if this is such an issue for you? Either they wear pull ups or they don’t sleep in your bed until they can sleep the night through without an accident. 

You let them push you around until you snapped. That’s on you and your lack of boundaries. The minute they started playing with the water, you should have taken it away. Same with the gummies. You let them make you angry until you snap, and because they know you won’t do anything they keep acting like that. You are, right now, the kind of person who would raise an awful terror of a child.

It was the heaviest package under the tree and you could feel their excitement when I told them they could open it on Christmas eve. They tore into it like a couple savages.

1750,"WIBTA if I told my ex-husband that he can't have his love interest(s) come over to the house that WE currently own? Here's the long and short:

SO and I met in highschool. Were together for 10 years, married for 5 of those 10. No kids. We purchased a home during said marriage. He and I both work, always kept our finances separate, and split all expenses down the middle. His best friend has rented a room in our house since the home was purchased and best friend pays rent each month, albeit a very low amount of rent. But if you work for the tax man, that last sentence is not true and idk what you're talking about.

Fast forward to the marriage breakdown-- We couldn't work out our differences. My lawyer said this is the least contentious separation she has had in a while. We managed to all live under the same roof for 5 months while we prepped the house to sell it. I didn't want share space with him and his bestie anymore so I opted to rent a room from an internet stranger. I still come and go unannounced to grab stuff.

So, we're both rational beings... until... he texted me while I was at work asking if he could bring a love interest to the house. I'm pissed/ticked/angry/furious and have yet to respond bc I can't conjure a kind response. Most of my friends suggest I am overreacting.

I have been dating and I am glad to hear he is too. We will always be a big part of each other's history. I just can't fathom how he could even ask if he can Netflix and chill using the account his ex-wife pays for in the house his ex-wife still pays (essentially half) for.

1751,"AITA for not wanting my girlfriend to be friends with one of my old friends? To start, some backstory. So, me and my old friend (who I'll call X) used to be really good friends. I got upset at X because I felt like he was being a bad friend to me, and ignoring me all the time, so I brought it up to him and we had a friendship ending argument. We had drama going between us for a few months, and I found out he was cheating on his girlfriend with tons of other girls. (By cheating, it should be made clear that he hit on other girls all the time, and convinced them that he loved them, but because he already had a girlfriend, he was just leading them all on and breaking their hearts. My now girlfriend was one of these girls, which I didnt learn until later.) I lost all trust I had for him. 

Fast forward to recently. My girlfriend and X were already friends, even before we were dating. We are all in high school, so she sees X in school sometimes, but the main place they talk is outside of school, because they are both in marching band after school. I had talked to her about X, and told her that I am okay with them being friends, but I dont want them being super close, not because I don't trust her, because I dont trust him. She agreed that she wont be too close to him, but they would still be friends.

So, one day, I happened to see her at her practice, and she was talking to X, standing really close together. I didn't mind it too much, but the next day, I saw them again and they were standing way too close for me to be comfortable. I brought it up with her later, when we had some quiet time. She said she was sorry, and blocked him on social media (which I thought was a bit excessive, but I didnt state that to her). 

A few days later, we went out to eat, and when I finished, I was looking at her snapchat (not snooping, just saying hi to some people I dont really talk to much myself) and found that she didn't actually block him. We had an argument about it, and it ended up with her fully blocking him and not talking to X at all in person anymore. She didn't want to block X because she didn't want to start problems with him. 

I also feel like I should of been more clear of how close I wanted them to be, or not be. I feel like I might of wronged them both. Neither X or my girlfriend is upset at me, (not really friends with X, we just have so many mutual friends that we talk a bit since we figured out our problems) but I still feel wrong about how I handled this whole situation.

1752,"WIBTA if I didn't let my temporarily homeless brother stay with me and my girlfriend for a week? So my girlfriend and I live in a thousand square foot apartment, and this morning my brother called asking to stay with us for a week. I told him I'd have to get back to him after talking to the gf.

My gf and I are 23 and 22. My brother is 32.

Recently he was kicked out of his house by his girlfriend and has nowhere to stay. My mom said he could stay with her, but she's out of town until at least the 21st. He'd be staying with us for six days.

I'm seriously torn here.

There are some pros and definitely some cons to letting him stay with us.

Pros:

* Although we're not very close, he's still my brother and it's probably the ""right"" thing to do.
* None of the guilt that comes with telling him no. I'm sure my dad would understand if I said no, but my mom is a notorious guilt-tripper and my brother seems to have picked some of it up as well. I'm not very close with any of them, but it would still hurt a bit to know they're mad at me.

Cons:

* We don't really have a lot of space. We have a bedroom he could use, but my gf keeps all of her clothes in there. She's not a big people person, so making her walk around him sleeping at 6:30am for her clothes every morning for six days is a huge ask.
* I'm worried about the strain it'll put on my relationship with my gf. As I said, she's not big on people. Especially people she doesn't know that well staying in her home for extended periods. It doesn't feel right to subject both her and I to the kind of stress it'll cause.
* My brother has a history of drug use, and while he has been clean for more than a year now, it's still hard to trust him completely to be alone in my apartment for so long. Some past experience with a different brother makes me even more anxious about this.
* This last one is kind of petty, but we had plans to have some out of town friends come down this weekend and most likely spend the night. And I really don't want him here when they come down.

I'm leaning toward telling him no, but I still need to talk to the gf about it all. But if I do tell him no, I don't know what other options he has. I know he has a decent job, and I think he might have a bit of money, so maybe he could stay in a motel or something? 

I don't know.

If you were in his situation, clean and sober, and needed a place to crash for a week, would you expect him to help, and maybe if he told you of plans, agree to get a motel for the night he had guests coming over.

He says yes then asks if I will help him move a dresser from the gate to the living room so it doesn’t get water damage if it rains. To be fair, it’s about ten feet and a medium sized dresser.

It’s a little damaged but not terrible dresser. The reason I had a problem with it is because we are planning on moving in a couple months and I only want to spend my money on furniture right now that is new/almost new and somewhat matching for the room. The reason he wants this particular dresser is because the dimensions fit for the fish tank he has on top of it that he built a small aquaponic system around. He has shot down all the dressers I have found with similar dimensions online because he says it’s probably not sturdy enough. I say fine. But if he wants a new dresser for it now and I don’t like it and we don’t plan on moving the dresser or fish tank with us when we leave that I’m not putting any effort into it.

He knows from previous conversations that the statement is not something that anyone ever really wants to hear and has never actually made anyone more calm, ever. Also, I’m just pretty irked that I don’t feel good, I’m sore, and I’m still up and ready to help him and he shoots that at me and tells me to stop being so dramatic. Another genius zinger. I say, excuse me what did you say? He says “nothing.”  I say, “no I want to know. What did you just say to me?” But he tells me he told me to calm down. I say “fine, I’ll calm myself right down on this couch and you can move the dresser yourself.” He gets mad, tells me he does stuff for me all the time and storms off to take what I imagine is a very angry shower.

Recently my OCD flatmate has been telling me off of leaving the kitchen in a mess when I just see it as small easy to miss cleaning jobs. Things like leaving bread crumbs on the surface or not emptying out the washing bowl. 

Whenever she’s told me about a mess I’ve always clean up the mess and tried to clean everything I’ve used, from the oven to the sink as soon I know there is a mess. 

Recently though things have been escalating and I’m just getting tired of the nagging, and the bitchy comments about fairly small things. 

I understand she has OCD so it’s not her fault she feels and sees thing differently to me but I feel I’m going out of my way trying to be clean but it’s never enough and I’m getting sick of feeling like I’m walking on egg shells around her. Am I the asshole for feeling like this? What should I do about it if anything?","YTA bread crumbs cleaning and draining the sink are not OCD traits...they are pretty standard.

I don’t want to take in his son (2M) because, having already raised a son through young childhood, I know how difficult they are and the entire experience was very unpleasant. I would rather just take in their daughter since we already have a young daughter anyway and the two of them can bond.

I think this is perfectly reasonable since my nephew is young and won’t remember his sister anyway. We think the best situation for him is to put him up for adoption to a loving couple.

So for a little context I work 23 hours from the town my wife refuses to leave. 4 weeks working 2 weeks off. We have two kids 10 and 8 plus one on the way. 

I make pretty good money, so when I took this job we sat down and talked about her staying at home because she would have to  Cook, clean, care for the kids. All by herself. She said of course and was excited.

So at the beginning of this week she tells me she is pregnant. Sweet. Right.

On thrusday I work from 330am until 5pm then jump in my car and drive 23 hours straight. 

I dont expect much from her given that she has morning sickness and normal pregnancy issues.  I get home home exhausted but willing to watch the kids I mean they r old enough it isnt much to ask. Plus it is almost dinner time. 
She then gathers up her purse and claims she needs to get some craft crap for our daughter. Then tells me to make dinner. At this point I take stock of the apartment and clothes are everywhere. My son's room has a pile of clean clothes on the floor, she left them. The dishes haven't been done. Basically it is not a shit show but it is working on it. 

I said screw it made dinner and did the dishes. (Still haven't slept yet) she gets home and I let her have it. She claims I am being an ass cause I am gone. I called her a name that I regret, but she could have just moved with me to my job. Where I want her to be anyway, so I can help her out.

1775,"AITA for telling my parents I don't want them to live in my neighborhood? Background: I had moved out of my home state several years ago. A few years into my new job, my dad lost his, but got a new one in the area I was now in. They ended up moving into a house on the street behind ours (I'm married, 2 kids). This is a little too close for comfort. I love my parents but they can be difficult in large doses. 
I had tried reassuring my wife (and myself) - it won't be all bad. They can watch the kids once in a while, and they are so close that visits can be shorter. Dad tried to reassure me, ""we'll make sure not to impose or drop by unannounced.""
Well let me tell you how it turned out:
My dad may have had the best of intentions but my mom did not ascribe to that. They both struggle with grasping common courtesy and would infrequently show up for ""quick stops"" which were suprises for my wife. She got the brunt of it since I was at work.
The babysitting didn't really pan out either. They wanted to, but after seeing them interact with my kids, my wife and I had concerns with leaving them alone with the kids, and responsible for them. We certainly did not want them driving anywhere with them, but even interactions with the kids could lead to guilt trip manipulation or uncalled for voice raising. I want my parents to enjoy time with their grandkids but we figured it's best if we were around to handle the kiddos ourselves.

So fast forward. I moved back to my home state about a year ago. We love our new house and neighborhood. My parents have visited and love it too. My parents have also wanted to get back here. I'm able to help my dad get a job here so now they are moving back.
But they are looking at houses in OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.

I talked to them about it today when they said that a house in our neighborhood was their top choice. It was worse than I expected. My dad was PO'd, they both said I basically slapped them in the face. They admitted they wanted to move there so when they are older and need help we can take care of them. While I want to be there to help, this feels like it places an unfair burden on me and my wife, less on my brother since they'd be walking distance from us, and mostly on my wife since I would be at work. What's the worst is that they never thought to ask how we'd feel about the whole thing.

TLDR: Parents struggle with boundaries when they lived behind me. I moved and now history might repeat itself so I say something to them about it.
AITA?","YTA for only setting boundaries with your parents when YOU were impacted. You should have set boundaries years ago when they were burdening your wife.

When your parents lived behind you and your wife, you knew it was untenable. When you relocated back to your home state, instead of leaving your parents up to their own devices, you helped your dad get a job in your area. You basically blew up your own geographical boundary.

I get the impression it’s been easy for you to shrug off your parents disrespectful behavior because your wife bore the brunt of it. You had very little skin in the game. 

It was ONLY when your parents said they expected YOU to assume the responsibility of taking care of them in their later years that you managed to assert yourself.

Some back story:
My FF started going out with someone i was in secondary school with who I never got along with and I told her this but she didn't care, BFX got in contact with FF saying that he was really controlling and stopped her from seeing friends. I never saw FF much in person to begin with but when they started dating I saw her even less and we didn't message as much (we constantly messaged each other). One day HBF started messaging me after taking her phone, I only noticed because normally she ended her messages with a ""X"" and when he took FF's phone that stopped so I knew something was up. 


Anyway on with the story, so one night I was playing assassins creed 3 remastered with AS and got a call from an unrecognised number so left the room to answer it, when I answered I didn't know who it was. All of a sudden he started going off on me about how I'm an asshole and saying that FF said she didn't want to be friends and was only my friend out of pitty, that's when ik it was HBF.

This made me angry which is really hard to do because I'm a very calm person, so I started saying how he was really controlling, stopping her from seeing any friend's that were male or that didn't meet his ""standards"" and that FF didn't seem happy with him. I then told him about how me and FF hung out after he banned her from seeing or talking to me. I was so angry I could barely get words out so hung up. 

I'm assuming he confronted her because FF tried to call me but I gave my phone to AS who answered and said FF sounded upset like she was crying but I felt so guilty for telling HBF that we met know he'd be angry and it could jepredise their relationship.

A little background: we are four sisters with one younger brother. I (21f) am the second-oldest, I am very close to my older sister M(22) and less close to the next sister F(19). Our youngest sister P is 18.

When we were kids, she was a real tomboy. She didn’t play with us, only with my brother J(17) and she hated “girly” things. We used to tease her by holding her down and forcibly putting make-up on her, lol, and it took 3 of us to hold her! she was a wildcat. But last year she got her braces off (really bad teeth) and finished high school and suddenly she’s all acting like a beauty queen. She wears dresses sometimes now and even bought a pair of high heels which are ridiculous, she’s never worn them before, and they make her tower over all of us. She acts like she doesn’t even notice that all the guys are staring at her, she’s super-friendly with them and talks about sport and computers and cars, you know, the whole “I’m not like other girls” thing.

You have to understand how super annoying she is. She was never popular at school, just lived in her own world and read all the time and because of that she always pronounces words wrong, like she’s only read them not heard them. I try to correct her so she won’t embarrass herself in public but she just grins like it’s funny.

Now my sister M is having a big party before she goes away overseas to study in Siena, and everyone is invited. It’s at a big hall and is catered. P asked if she could wear a dress of mine which I’d been meaning to take up bc it’s too long for me but fits her bc she’s a scarecrow. I said yes but now I don’t want to. I want to wear that dress myself one day and I frankly don’t want it to be seen as her dress. Bc there were 4 girls, all mine and M’s clothes got passed down to her and F when we were growing up, so she’s always worn my clothes and I’m kind of over it.

She hasn’t got any money, our parents give her an allowance but it’s not much tbf and has to pay for a lot of things. The rest of us get more bc we’re in college. She wanted to work as a life saver at the pool over summer but our Gramma came to stay after her operation and Mom needed P to help her at home with Gramma who is a bit of a handful. Also Mom said she would just swan around showing herself off and should be home helping out instead.

She still had the allowance though, she could have saved it and bought her own dress for M’s party. So I just told her I was wearing it, though I’ve actually bought another one, and J, our little brother, overheard me talking about it with M and now he says I’m an asshole and that he’ll tell her if I don’t.

I don’t think I am. It’s my dress. I don’t want her ruining it. And my sisters don’t think I should let her wear it either. It’s only J who thinks that.

So am I being an asshole or should she get her own damn clothes and stop trying to take everything from us?

EDIT: Wow, people are saying some really harsh things. It's gone beyond just the dress thing.  
I don't think I've explained it all very well, it's hard to. Growing up, Paulie was always in trouble. I've been trying to think of what she did so I could explain but I can't really think of any good examples... it was more her attitude. She was always being punished and I guess I've gotten used to everything being her fault. Maybe I'm not being entirely fair. She has a right to grow up. But we've got a family dynamic that works, she's the only person it doesn't work for, and what are we supposed to do, change the whole family to suit her?  
It's just that, it sounds like one thing when I'm talking to Marcy about it, she and I understand what a pain P is. But now putting it before other people without M here, it's like, everyone's sticking up for Paulie. I'm not used to that. I really don't know whether I just haven't explained it properly or whether I should have another think about who she is.","YTA, not about the dress, but for your past actions and how disrespectful you are now.

1797,"AITA for wanting to talk to my boyfriend even though he was tired Last night my bf and I were playing a game and calling each other (we don’t live together). We had been playing for an hour and a half when he’s like “I don’t want to play anymore” and left the game. He told me we could still call and talk but he just didn’t want to play. At first I was like why not and tried to get him to play again, but he told me he was tired and planning on sleeping soon. I respected that so I stopped playing and asked if we could FaceTime for a few min before he went to sleep. I just wanted to see him because I barely saw him all day as we both had a pretty busy day. He declined and again told me he was tired and cut me off by saying good night. I tried to reason with him and brought up how minutes ago he literally told me we could talk. Without replying to what I just said, he hung up. 

This really ticked me off. It’s pretty rude to just hang up on someone without saying anything to what they just said unless both people make it clear that they’re done conversing (e.g. both people say bye and hang up). So I text him and tell him that it was kind of rude of him to just hang up on me like that and again bring up how he was the one who said we could talk because he didn’t reply when I said it the first time. He texts back saying he said good night and “drifted off” which doesn’t make sense because he’s very awake texting me back less than a minute after he hung up. He then tells me that I’m not respecting him and how tired he is because he had a long day (totally ignoring that I also had a long day) and asks if he really said we could talk as if I just made it up or something. We continue to argue about it for a while and he calls me clingy and problematic which is totally uncalled for. He also claims that we never FaceTime for a few minutes which is false because we’ve literally done it before. 

I don’t feel like I’m asked for a lot here, just a few minutes on FaceTime is all. I know he was tired but I feel like he could spare 5 minutes calling me especially if he could spare 30 minutes arguing. AITA for wanting to call him even though he was tired?? 



Another edit for clarity: He didn’t say we could talk to “get me off his back” or anything. I was not badgering him to stay up while we were playing. After he stopped playing I only asked him once to keep playing (I wasn’t begging him) to which he replied he was tired (so before then I didn’t know he was tired). Since he told me that, I asked if we could FaceTime for a few minutes knowing that he would sleep very soon. I was not telling him that he couldn’t go to sleep and I wasn’t hurt/mad because he was tired and didn’t want to stay up. I just think when someone says we can talk they mean it. That’s what I was upset about. Also after he said good night and before he hung up, I wasn’t rambling or yelling at him. I simply asked “I thought you said we could talk?” So this is how it went for those of you who think I’m talking his ear off or something when I’m really not: 
Him: good night
Me: I thought you said we could talk?
Him: Hm *hangs up*
After he hung up I didn’t text him with intent on starting an argument. I think it’s important to communicate in a relationship and usually we say our goodbyes when we hang up. I didn’t say he was bad or call him names or something because he hung up. I said “It’s kinda rude to hang up on me like that and you didn’t reply to what I said.”

Anyways with all of that said, I’m not looking for validation and I’m not butthurt because people are saying I’m TA. I can justify my own actions if I want even if I asked for people’s opinions and it doesn’t matter if it doesn’t change their opinions. I recognized that my actions were not right and I talked it out with my bf and we are happy together which is all that really matters. ","YTA. When someone’s tired, even a phone call for a few minutes feels like a chore because you just want to rest. He told you that and you still pushed.

1801,"AITA for abandoning my (possibly) toxic family ? AITA for planning to abandon my (possibly) toxic family?

So, my family consists of alcoholics with strong opinions, drug dealers, delusional narcissists (not really) , fascistic ideals, and big egos.   I want nothing to do with them, especially since we are opposites.  We can not even have conversations outside small talk.   They can sometimes be funny, though.  They also are much more practical than I.  

My mother is controlling or attempts to be,  naive, delusional, friendly,gregarious, and organized.  The average mother archetype, right?  I let her believe that she is helpful to me,  well she is... she provides me with a home and food.  This is very nice of her, she does not have to do this.  Anyways,  I do not share anything with my mother besides past experiences and the things her nurturing provided.  Such as tone, hand gestures, body measurements, etc.   

My brother who is now living with me and my mother, is very opinionated. He has a “winners and losers worldview.” I do not disagree, but in his terms I am a loser.  He expects me to respect him and follow his rules of living.  He expects full cooperation, which I do not give.  

I have decided that I do not want to work on these relationships.  I will bring my mother along in my success,  but I will only reach out when I feel like it.  My family has done nothing but talk bad about each other.  I find it and them disgusting.  I want nothing to do with them.   Even the ones who appear nice seem to me like they don’t actually care.  If my family were worth having, I’d have them.  But they aren’t.  They show their love by calling each other attractive, kisses , hugs,  gifts,  and spending to me around each other.   Which is superficial to me.

I hate family functions, all we do is segregate.  There are elders and young ones.  The elders judge the young for their reckless behavior while also giving them occasional loans to fuel their latest shenanigans.  The young blindly respect the elders, as if they were infallible.  The young have their own young who run around and do children things despite the public beatings they’ve received two minutes earlier. The children want attention but the parents care more about their social lives.  

When I try to explain, especially to therapists, they seem to think that I am selfish.  I probably am, I do nothing for anyone else.  I am more concerned about my being alone.  But this would be my reasoning.  I often consider whether I am being dramatic or not.  Sometimes my family can be pleasant, but then again even the most evil man alive has held the door open just once, I suppose.

 Throwaway   
   
 I (16f) go to an all girls school, grades k-12.  There’s recently been this one girl, I think she’s 7 years old, who saw me one day after school and just kinda clung to me.   
   
 Recently, my friends in the same grade took notice and have started to make fun of me. I told them that I don’t want to talk to her, that she just came up to me one day. They kept making fun of me.   
   
 She’s been getting more and more annoying too. She finds every reason to talk to me, any free time we have she finds me and starts hanging around. It’s embarrassing and I was getting tired of her.   
   
 So, the other day, I was heading to my car after school. I usually park it on a street just outside the school. She found me after school, as usual, and began to follow me this time. I kept telling her to stop following me, but she wouldn’t.   
   
 When we got to my car, I just said to her “I have to go now, I’ll see you tomorrow” and she said “no! I want to go to your house!” And I said “I’m sorry, but you can’t. Go back and wait for parents” and she told me that she walks home.   
   
 Here comes the part where I might be the asshole... I told her “here, how about this: just wait for me here, and I’ll be right back”. And she said okay. Then I went home.   
   
 The next day, I got called into the principal’s office. The principal told me that the girl’s parents had called, because she didn’t go home that day. She said that the girl didn’t go home, and her parents were driving around looking for her. They found her on the sidewalk, and she told them that I told her to wait there. The principal said the girl was standing there for four hours.   
   
 I got suspended for a week. My parents are furious at me, and made me go to her house to apologize.   
   
 To be fair, I didn’t think that she would actually be stupid enough to stay there, not for four hours at least. She said that she walks home, I thought she would just leave eventually.

This is a recent development and I brought it up one night after her sister brought the new baby over for a visit. She says nothing has changed but I can see it. I told her she clearly likes kids and that she'd regret it if she did decide to be sterilized and would probably end up wanting a baby.

1804,"AITA for not returning the RSVP and not going to my old friend's wedding I suspect this might be a pretty cut and dry case but would like clarification.

Roughly midway through 2018, I received an RSVP from someone who I'd consider my best friend throughout high school. We'd lost contact and I'd not spoken to him personally since sometime in 2014. 

I'd been seeing regular updates from him on Facebook whenever I signed in, which was infrequently, and things seemed to be going well for him. It looks like he's got a house, a family - all the good stuff. 

I'll be upfront here: i'm afraid of responsibility and commitment and I'd consider myself quite introverted. I'll only take on responsibility when I have to (e.g. work) and am reluctant to commit to saying I'll be at certain places on certain days. I know this makes me a poor excuse for an adult at the age of 26 and is generally a poor character trait. 

I considered when I received the RSVP to said friends wedding that I'd have to go out and buy or rent a new suit as I'd outgrown my previous suits, and the thought of meeting his soon-to-be wife for the first time at their own wedding made me feel a bit iffy. The issue of acquiring a new suit was only a minor excuse I made to myself as I wasn't strapped for cash at the time. 

Now to the question. This was the first RSVP I'd ever personally received and I assumed that simply not replying would technically mean 'no I can't go' (does it?). I'll not lie, I also reasoned to myself that if I didn't explicitly reply it would soften the blow, so to speak, in that a soft no is better than a firm and solid no along with some poor excuses. 

I'm asking this question today because I saw said friend whilst out shopping. He didn't ask me why I never replied or never went and the conversation wasn't awkward per se. But I obviously felt a sense of lingering shame and guilt wash over me, which was exacerbated by my girlfriend (also present) telling me that not replying to the RSVP was an asshole move. 

I suspect that if nothing, my cowardice in not replying makes me an asshole. Does it?","YTA - it's rude not to reply.

1807,"WIBTA if I asked the people I invited for an informational to Venmo me for the several expensive drinks they ordered? My cofounder, tech lead, and I are bootstrapping a startup. Last week, my cofounder met a man (we’ll call him Alex) who works at a major company in the advertising industry (our target market), and my cofounder ended up inviting Alex out to chat over coffee or a drink. The context was that we wanted to get his advice on an accelerator program that his company just launched and that we recently applied to. Alex responded that he was happy to chat “over a beer or Joe”.

He offered to invite his colleague who is more knowledgeable about what we’re building. Even better was that his colleague is a mentor in the accelerator program. Alex then sent us a few suggestions for bars we could meet at. We ended up choosing the bar that seemed not too noisy and was between the other two options in terms of price point. It also had a happy hour selection.

When we got to the bar, Alex surprised us with another colleague he invited to join us. She wasn’t as relevant or connected to the accelerator program, but was friendly enough, very talkative, and did give us a bunch of her opinions on what we should do. (It turns out none of the advice we got was actually directly useful or relevant to the accelerator though, but was good insight on their company.)

Here’s my question:

My team stuck to the happy hour menu and limited ourselves each to one drink so we could keep our tab down. We were mentally prepared to pay for the three people’s drinks since they were giving us info. However, we often find that most people are kind enough to offer to pay for themselves knowing that we’re a startup and financially strapped, or they would show some restraint and only order one drink with a reasonable price. So we kind of assumed that was the case here especially with so many people we didn’t directly invite. So we didn’t pay much attention to the drinks they were ordering.

After about an hour, the people from the company said they had to leave and asked if they could give us cash for their drinks and we said sure, no problem! They left, we got the check, and our jaws dropped. The bill came to $130. Between me, my cofounder, and our tech lead, we ordered about $24 worth of drinks. So the rest of that was from the three. It turns out Alex ordered several bourbons, the woman ordered several proseccos, and the accelerator mentor guy ordered a few expensive drinks as well. Alex, who left the earliest, left no cash. The woman left only $3 dollars. Thankfully the mentor guy (who gave us the most helpful advice) threw in $35, enough to cover his own drinks. So we had to pony up for the $60 worth of drinks Alex and his female colleague ordered. Is this normal?

I think I would be asshole to ask them to Venmo us more money. Plus I can’t think of a way to do without making things awkward at this point. But is there a tactful way to handle or avoid this kind of situation in the future so that I’m not an asshole but not a pushover either?

","YTA - You invited these people out with the clear intent of picking their brains about business and network, so you probably should foot the bill.

1812,"AITA for making excuses not to eat food while being a guest at cousins' house? Apologies if my English grammar is weird.

So this summer I was obligated to attend a pre-studies (preparation) course at university for architecture. I've no clue how to describe that in English, this is just a literal translation.

To explain, I had to be in my town of studies for 2 weeks in order to complete a certain class before first year. My dormitory wasn't yet open at that time, the admissions for it aren't even ""officially"" completed yet, and for that reason I had to find other accommodation.

My dad has cousins living in that town, who said they'd take me in free of charge for those two weeks, which was very generous.

However the only problem was that the food my cousins eat is really, really spicy. At least for my taste, as my family lives in a seaside part of the country and I'm pretty much used to a diet of fish, vegetables and olive oil lmao.

My cousins live in the continental part where it's a lot more common to eat such heavily spiced food, lots of cured meat, sausages, stuff that I generally don't like.

Anyway I experienced something like a shock the first day I arrived during dinner. They served a stuff peppers dish, which we also eat sometimes at home, but their version was *extremely* spicy, my tongue and throat literally burned. They also had nothing on the side to take out the spiciness, except water and bread.

I tried my best to eat but I just physically couldn't finish the meal. I also felt ashamed because no-one else seemed to have problems, and when my great aunt joked if the food was bad because she noticed I was eating very slowly, I said no and made an excuse that my stomach was upset because of the trip.

The food they ate was similar during my whole stay. I would eat what I could, but since I didn't want to upset them, when I knew I definitely wouldn't like something, I would make up excuses for having to be at university longer, or going out with classmates to eat. Usually I'd just grab something at the bakery instead.

1817,"AITA- I have a non-binary “friend” who is extremely rude so I have stopped using the correct pronouns. I am an 18 year old freshman in college and I am an avid D&D player. I am currently in two campaigns at the moment and both of them involve my non-binary acquaintance, let’s just say her name is River, and I used to enjoy her company. However, recently River has become super annoying and rude to many of my good friends. Especially when we play D&D together. 

In one campaign River plays this huge and flamboyant firbolg and has taken every opportunity to remind everyone in the party that we have no idea what the fuck gender this monster is. It’s growing annoying and the way River has gone about correcting us when using the wrong pronouns is downright rude. Sometimes we slip up and say “she” when we’re in game and they immediately cut off the conversation and grunt “them.” repeatedly until we apologize and say “them” instead.

River is the DM of my other campaign with several of my good friends in it as well. When we play the game it’s fine but River makes unnecessary rule checks and hampers down on us having fun in the game and forces us (by benevolent forces in game) to go along the story path she wants to follow. The party has 6 people in it so inevitably there’s some side conversations going on throughout the game and River has said, on many occasions, that “side conversations are to be left outside so that my spotlight as DM shouldn’t be taken away.” She also gets upset when we miss little details of the story because she talks super fast. She even snapped at my elvish friend for wanting to read inscriptions on the wall instead of fighting with the group. 

Here’s a bit of backstory: when me and River first met, River must’ve heard my name wrong somewhere. But she refused to call me anything other than Anita (which is NOT my name) even after I showed her my license AND she found and friended me on Facebook. My roommate and I were pretty annoyed with it so I jokingly said “well then I won’t use your right pronouns until you use my right name” (which I personally think is fair, but it may not be) 

River’s rude behavior has caused us to grow apart, even though she’s really clingy and calls me and my roommate her best friends all the time. Though she’s a big part of my hobby, so I can’t just stop all contact like I’d prefer. 

Here’s my opinion: respect must be earned. So in order for me to use the right pronouns she has to be respectful, right? Or am I just an asshole and this is all an unnecessary petty thing for me to do? 

(Also, I’m posting this on mobile so sorry for any mistakes or typos) 

Edit: thanks for all the feedback! Also, some of you may possibly be thinking I’m purposely getting her pronouns wrong and being a dick about it. I’m not going around and correcting people who use the right pronouns and being like “well SHEEE can bla blah” and emphasizing the wrong pronouns. I’m simply not correcting myself when I use the wrong ones ","YTA. To be clear, River is also an asshole, but you should hold yourself to a higher standard. You don't get to ""punish"" people when they don't behave as you like... and do you really think using this person's non-preferred pronouns is going to get them to respect you?

1819,"AITA for wanting to rehome or euthanize our cat? Disclaimer: I love my cat very much and I'm struggling to find the right solution so please don't be too hard on me 

My wife and I adopted a cat from a shelter last year and unfortunately it turns out she has a spinal injury  that causes issues when she squats, mainly a loss of sensation back there.  This leads to constant accidents around the house and anal glands needing to be drained, infections leading to vomit and constant visits to the vet. We've done everything we can including buying the most expensive fiber food to keep her stool soft, putting puppy pads around the house, we have tried multiple litters and litter boxes, nothing we do helps our cat. And it's worth mentioning that our cat seems very happy, she doesn't seem to be in any pain or suffering, just discomfort I think. 

The vet says there is nothing they can do to fix this aside from antibiotics and draining the anal glands when they fill up..short of that he said it's all just pain management.

I've brought up the possibility of moving her to the farm to be a farm cat (where they're very nicely taken care of) or finding her a new home or ultimately, putting her down... None of these suggestions go over well at all and leads to very tough arguments. 

AITA? 

Are there any other suggestions you have to give me some perspective","You’re basically asking three questions, so I’ve got three answers. 

YTA if you dump her on a farm and expect her to thrive there. If she needs her anal glands manually expressed and antibiotics to fight infections, she will not receive the kind of hands-on care she needs as a farm cat. She could very well die, probably quite slowly and painfully. 

YTA if you euthanize her. You mentioned she DOES have a decent quality of life; she’s a happy cat, just a high-maintenance one with special needs. 

NAH if you find her a good home with someone capable of providing her with the level of care she requires. This is what you really should do if you don’t think you’re up to the task. ",1,YTA,0.0,0.0,1

I used to think I wanted children, but after we had the first I discovered that setting myself on fire would be the preferred option, if I had the choice. Unfortunately, my wife disagreed. Eventually she persuaded me to have a second child. You do not need to tell me that this is the stupidest thing I have ever done.

Surprise! I'm not that happy about it. 4 years now of sleep deprivation related brain damage have left me staggering through each day, barely awake some days, dosed up on coffee other days. I'm not delighted.

&#x200B;

Even more surprising - she's not that delighted either. It's hard work being a stay at home mother to two children. But this was not unexpected, since it was hard work with number one as well. The fact that it's hard work was the main reason I didn't want number two, and part of my argument was that I didn't think she would be able to handle it either.

after she made her point, i said something like “dag, yeah, i’m so sorry [name.] it really sucks.”
she asked me how i would know- I’m white. (and i really am. i’m ridiculously pale.)
i said i’d been mocked for being welsh pretty much my whole life. at this, she went off on one, saying that my experience of racism wasn’t real racism. i was a little taken aback but i knew it was a sensitive topic and didn’t want to make a scene or naught so i apologised and we moved on.
later, one of my (fully english) childhood friends told me that what i said was really screwed up, and that i couldn’t compare my experience as a white welsh person to that of a brown indian person when it came to racism.
i don’t know, that really pissed me off. this was somebody who had been in my same school for years. she’d seen how other kids had laughed at my accent in year five when i had been in england for literally two weeks. whenever i spoke welsh, they’d imitate me. on two occasions, upon falling asleep in class, i’d woken up to find “sheep-shagger” markered on my skin by one of my peers (once on my arm, once on my forehead) and though it all sounds like a cliché, that shit was hard to wash off. i was referred to as sheep-shagger through the whole of year six and seven, the name only faltering when the deputy-head told everyone to knock it off. that didn’t stop all of it, of course. kids are brutal. one asked if i liked Tom Jones, i said yeah, of course, and they said something like “hope you don’t like him too much, he’s probably your cousin” to which another boy responded “dude her parents are probably cousins”
the topic of intense incest wasn’t an uncommon one in that classroom when the good old land o’ my birth was discussed.

During a spinning class, the instructor came up to me and, without asking me, put his hand on my back to correct my posture. I immediately shook his hand off and told him ""Please, no touching. Thanks."" He looked irritated but left me alone. He never came to my bike again during the session. In a different class, a female instructor pushed my legs up during crunches, when I physically couldn't pull them up further. I simply let my legs fall and waved a hand to signal ""leave me alone.""

So to look out for my brother and Sister I asked my mom if I could add them as authorized users, cut the cards and let them piggyback, to which she replied, ""that is completely unacceptable.

I work 9-6 Monday to Friday but he only worked evenings so our schedules didn’t mesh. However, he wanted to see it ASAP.

She said she refused to be home alone with some random guy I found on the internet and that anything could happen. I thought she was being a bit ridiculous. For example, she was home alone one time when someone came to fix our internet . She insisted that was different since it was through our landlord and it was an official business but this is some random guy she doesn’t know and that “strange men” make her nervous.

1831,"AITA for not being quiet about my beliefs (or lack thereof) around religious friends and family? For some context: I'm an atheist who has grown up in a primarily atheist family (my mother who used to be a non-devout Christian de-converted in my early childhood, and my father has been an atheist my entire life). I myself enjoy reading religious and atheistic texts, watching videos, having discussions about religion/philosophy, etc. 

Now, as my close family and the vast majority of my friends are atheists as well, I have a habit of off-handedly saying things that highlight my non-belief (knowing that I am with company that share my views). 

The nature of these comments is never directed at the followers of a religion (ex. 'you're a fool if you believe X), but certainly include expressing disbelief at specific religious tenants, and stating that I don't believe in belief X because of Y.

Sometimes my friends/family will be hanging out with people who are either religious (though largely non-devout) or non-atheist (I'm unaware of their beliefs). On a few occasions I've noticed that these people either go quiet or look mildly uncomfortable after I make such 'atheistic' comments (typically by force of habit rather than deliberately). 

My stance has always been that I am not attacking them personally, merely expressing my views openly. I don't think these same people would baulk at a person of another religion saying something in-line with their beliefs, and I think that atheists should have this same courtesy (even if this opposes something I know the religious person believes in). In fact, a lot of my religious family and friends talk about God, say grace, etc. in front of me (which I'm never offended by). However, I sometimes feel like a bit of an asshole for clearly making these people uncomfortable. 

So, AITA for asserting opinions (inadvertantly or otherwise) that are going to upset the people I'm with?

I agree with her completely, and I don’t want to embarrass her in front of everyone by not looking up to par for the event. However, money is incredibly tight right now.

Coming into this year, I knew I didn't want it to be something I just got out of the way before heading to college, i wanted it to be a year I cherished. 
I did quickly find a group of people to hang out with so I never had the ""sitting alone in the lunchroom"" experience and this group was never disgruntled or mad about me tagging along. 
One last bit of necessary information was that our calculus teacher awarded extra points for those who got together for calculus study groups outside of class and after seeing the master sheet for the 2nd Trimester, which had a record of everyone's study groups, I saw that my space was completely blank while my friends had at least 5 sessions. I then learned that they had a group chat for the ""Honors Squad"" where they shared notes and stuff like that. No big deal, just add me in.
However, I'm an android user. Citing the fact that they wouldn't be able to keep the name of their iMessage group, they didn't add me and just told me to text them if I felt I needed notes. 
Being a new student, I'm a bit paranoid. So when I'm not in this group chat, I don't know what I'm missing out on. 
I mull over this situation by myself and with my parents and we figure out that I could use one of our old iPads as a texting device so that my friends can keep using iMessage groups. I just got added to the group today, but I voiced my frustrations to my friends about having to go through the trouble of getting an Apple device just so that I could communicate with them. Their response ""Ah well, deal with it."" 
That attitude made me feel really insulted. I was getting left out of stuff (or maybe not, I don't know, because I'm not being communicated with) just because they can't name their group chat. They refused to use third-party messaging software and left it up to me earn my way into their group chat. 
In my discussion with them earlier today, they straight up told me to ""just buy an iPhone"" or ""If you were a better friend, we'd add you."" These comments are probably jokes, but one thing that wasn't a joke was that they were unwilling to add me until I owned an Apple device. 
Three things to add just for fairness sake: 

* There are a couple more android users in our grade (it's a small grade) and they are also getting left out, so it doesn't seem like personal thing

My family recently owns a house in Orlando which we haven't seen before (only my parents).

As 2019 started to come to an end, my mother told me that she was planning a 10-day vacation to Orlando. My childhood was pretty much built there after all, and my parents found a nice deal for the international flight tickets.

When I told him about the trip he went completely ecstatic. He loved it.

My parents started to plan things. However, things started to turn sour when my boyfriend suggested Miami. Here's the thing, his mother's friend (an aunt) lives there as well as a school friend of his. A couple of years ago we went to Miami and stayed at his aunt's house and had a day to visit that same friend of his. Now that we were going to Orlando, he thought it wouldn't hurt to rent a car for a day to go to Miami and back that very night. He says we can have a great time, visit them and maybe go to one of the malls there and just have a day.

I wasn't on board for the following:

* **It's supposed to be a family trip**

We had a big discussion. He threatened to go with or without me. I told my mother and she, who's never been mad with him before, was furious, she even went as far as saying ""maybe this should have stayed a family trip with just the four of us to begin with"".

He felt very entitled to the situation, after all, I **had** given him the plane ticket as a present, meaning that he could really do whatever he pleases if he really wanted to. I explained how this was a family trip and he was being included and it should be somewhat expected of him to go with us. This doesn't mean that we can't do what we want, just stay in the same city at least...

He agreed but was very mad about the whole situation. And so I told my friends and they told me he was being the asshole and he told his friends and, of course, I was the asshole on that situation.

1853,"AITA for demanding my SO to let me know what time they will be home each day? Both SO and I have very busy schedules. This post involves food- namely me cooking. I am a skilled cook (I believe in happy eating), so even though I am busy I make it a priority to have food ready exactly at the time SO comes home everyday so there is zero wait time. I think cold food is a sin, and there have been plenty of times where if food was not ready, I have to deal with a very hangry SO. That said, I constantly spend a lot of my time asking ""what time are you home?"" and I'm constantly waiting for an underterminable time (due to SO also being busy) to know what that time is. While waiting I literally can't function, and I can't be productive. 


So today I was waiting and waiting, and when I finally get the response, it was ""I'm not eating at home"", and this was after I had all my mise en place in place (basically means food is ready to be cooked for 2), which made me snap ""if you didnt want to eat at home, you had an entire day to tell me so I wouldn't have to wait on you"".

We have a very loving and understanding relationship. I travel for work a lot so we’re often away from each other. The other day, she told me that she should be going to her best friend’s lingerie party. Her best friend is turning 31 on March 22nd and she’s having a lingerie pajama party. 

As soon as my girlfriend told me this, I felt very angry. I felt angry because wtf? Why would she go to a lingerie party when she has a boyfriend? When I expressed that to her, she kind of put her foot down and was like “yeah, you can’t tell me what to wear, and I’m going to my best friend’s lingerie party”. She did her best to assure me that nothing is going to happen. But it’s still very hard to get over the image of her walking around in a group of 50 people wearing nothing but lingerie. I got very upset and told her that she doesn’t take my feelings into consideration, she doesn’t care about what I have to say or how I feel about the party. She seems to only do her thing without considering how I feel about it.

1856,"AITA for kicking my roommate’s brother out of the apartment for showering with my roommate? My roommate Lara (20F) has a brother, Leon (18M). Her and I (20F) are juniors and he’s a freshman living in a dorm across campus. He crashes on our couch about every other weekend. I’ve been fine with that since he’s a respectful and fun person to have around. 


Yesterday morning, my own brother (23M) and I planned to have brunch and be out all day. I told Lara and Leon about that and headed off. After brunch, I came back to our room to get my lip balm that I forgot. I saw the bathroom door closed and I heard both Lara and Leon chatting indistinctly with the shower running. 


My first thought was they were showering together, which is very inappropriate in my book. It’s also very disrespectful of them to do such a taboo thing where I have to frequent everyday naked. I understand why they would not ask for my permission and this is the only place where they might get away, but who knows how many times they have already showered together when I’m not home? With these thoughts, I texted my brother to wait a bit in the car. 


I waited a minute to make sure it’s not one showering and one doing something else like brushing their teeth, blow drying their hair, putting on makeup, or using the toilet. It’s a small bathroom already. I hear no sound of any of those things so I banged on the bathroom door very hard telling them I know what they’re doing in there. I heard Leon say “oh shit”. They turned off the shower and Lara said Leon is showering with the opaque curtains there and she’s putting on makeup, so it’s nothing dirty. I’m pretty sure that wasn’t the case, but I didn’t want to keep my brother waiting.


When I got back to our apartment last night, I sat down next to Lara and Leon to have a serious conversation. I told them I’m 90% sure they were showering together since if she was doing makeup at the sink 2 feet from the door, her voice would be pretty clear, but since both of their voices were indistinct, it points to both of them being in the shower and that’s a big issue to me. They plead their case of doing separate things but I said even so, that’s still pretty inappropriate for a sister and her brother. I told Leon to get out of the apartment now, never use the shower and never stay overnight again. Lara yelled at me, saying she would never shower with Leon and I’m being a huge asshole. I told them I’m uncomfortable with him in our apartment and they should be grateful I would still let him in during the day. He called me a bitch and left. Lara continued our argument.


Today I heard Lara and my housemate from the other room gossiping about the situation. I joined in and my housemate said I shouldn’t kick Leon out even on the off chance they were actually showering together. She said every sibling relationship is different. Lara kept butting in telling us they weren’t even showering together. I saw we were at an impasse so I left to ask here.","YTA. You had no proof, first of all.

1857,"AITA for agreeing to do a favor for a friend, but backing out last minute? **tl;dr** *I told my friend I would teach three of his lectures while he travels back home. But I have a lot of deadlines that exact week, so I told him I will only do it if he can't find anyone else. He has not found anyone else, but I don't think he's tried very hard. I'm thinking of backing out because I'm way too busy.*

I'm a PhD student. Aside from working on my thesis, I also teach, tutor, grade papers, hold workshops, participate in seminars, attend conferences, meet my supervisor ... All stereotypical grad school stuff. It's deadline-after-deadline.

My department has a brand new post-doc named Samuel, who came from Scotland. He does research with my supervisor, as well as teach courses on campus --- it's also really busy for post-docs. I showed him around when he first started here, and we became friends quickly, often having lunch together and playing video games on the weekend. Even our research areas are similar.

Around a month ago, Sam told me his graduation is at the beginning of November and he's traveling to Scotland. So he asked me if I can cover three of his lectures while he's traveling. I agreed, assuming that the department would pay me for my time: prep for three lectures can be 6-7 hours of lecture time, which would be probably at least $200.

But about two weeks ago, some of my impending deadlines started seeming worse: I have two workshops this week and next, and I have to create and submit a final exam by this Thursday. The workshops are for high school students and are about two hours each, and I have to create problem sets with full solutions, in addition to designing \~3 hours of lectures --- I've been working nonstop on this for two weeks and I'm still not done. And the final exam is for a class I'm teaching, I have to come up with fair problems and then time the exam to make sure it's fair to the students, which takes hours of trial-and-error. TBH I have not had time to even start writing the exam, and it's due for mass printing in four days (the sitting is in two weeks). In fact I'm feeling guilty writing this post because I have to get back to work.

Knowing all this, about two weeks ago I told Sam that I might not be able to cover his lecture. In retrospect, I should have said ""cannot"", but I figured my lack of sleep is less important than his graduation. So I told him to PLEASE look for someone else to cover him, ask EVERYONE he knows (other grad students, other profs teaching the same course, etc), and if he still can't find someone THEN I will do it. Looking back, I think everything I said was just an winded asshole-y way to say ""I can't do it"". He also told me last week that I would not be getting paid, so now it's just a pure favor that I can't afford to do. And his lecture is at 8:30am, so considering that I won't be getting much sleep, I told him that it's very likely I will end up sleeping through the timeslot. So I'm not even a great candidate to cover him. I'll do it, but only as a last resort. I feel like a total asshole for changing my offer just because I'm busy (I mean, we're all busy) and I'm not getting paid, but ... I'm really swamped.

I told Sam all this two weeks ago, so I thought it'd be fair notice.

But he has not been looking for a replacement. He is just banking on me despite what I told him about my schedule. I just got a mass email from him on FRIDAY asking if anyone will cover him --- that's less than a week from the lecture. Why didn't he send this email sooner? And he only sent it to grad students (which is why I got it). There are several profs teaching the same class as him, so it would take less prep time for them because they have already prepared the lessons, but he hasn't asked any of them yet. I think he's been super lazy about trying to find someone despite how I told him I really don't have the time to cover him.

So now Sam's graduation trip has become my problem. I want to be a good friend and do him a favor out of good will, and trust me I would do it ANY other time, but this just happens to be incredibly busy for me and I don't have the time. I think he should have actually tried to find someone --- especially given what I told him about my schedule --- but on the other hand, I should have just given him a straight ""no"" at the outset. I realize it's too late for me to back out, but I don't know how to tell him to *try harder* *to find a replacement* without being a dick. I feel awful but I can't do it now.

Every year my parents hold a gift exchange at their home on Christmas Eve and my older brother and I always give each other thoughtful, but funny gifts. This year, he became vegan, because his wife wanted them to follow a new diet.  Something he complied with despite not liking it.

For our gift exchange, I decided to buy him two Popeye’s chicken sandwiches, since he did not get to participate in all the hype and a new PS4 controller. Before the exchange, my girlfriend and I bought the sandwiches, put them in an insulated bag and wrapped the bag.

When my brother unwrapped his gift, he was confused about why I got him a bag, until I told him to open it. When he saw the sandwiches, he started to laugh hysterically and immediately unwrapped one of them and ate it. The gift was a big hit, except to my sister in law. Afterward, she scolded me, by saying she didn’t appreciate me giving my brother food that goes against her beliefs.

I told her that brother is an adult that can make his own decisions and it made him happy, besides I wasn't even thinking about her beliefs when I did it.

She turned bright red and stormed off.

Later, I got a text from my brother telling me he was in hot water for eating the sandwiches, but he didn’t care. He appreciated the gift regardless.

1861,"AITA for calling a girl a slut? So this happened a decent amount of time ago but I finally want to get a definitive answer from randoms because people I know will just side with whoever they are friends with.

So basically, there is this one girl at my school, we'll call her L.  L has basically continuously had a boyfriend since age 13.  She sent nudes at 13, lost her virginity at 15, over the past 4 or so years she has dated 15+ guys that I know of.  A notable thing is that she lied about losing her virginity for several months until she broke up with the guy she lost it to and he called her out. 

Anyways, this whole incident started after a particularly volatile series of events in which L lead on a boy for about a month, the boy finally stopped caring and got with another girl who we will call D, and L contacted D's ex-boyfriend claiming that D left him for the other guy.  Obviously, this created a giant rift between the two and via snapchat, they both started being super passive agressive towards each other and literally recruiting other students to post passive agressive messages on snapchat for them.  The whole thing went down as legend.

Long story short, D had the majority of support, including mine, and L went into some kind of social exile.  Anyways, literally a day after L had many of her friends turn against her, and she lost the man she was trying to go after, I get a message from her asking if I want to fuck.  I thought it was some kind of joke at first, but it became evident that she was dead serious.  In my eyes, I was clearly some kind of second.  Some kind of backup that she would just go to if the first guy she was trying to get with didn't work out.  Also I don't know if this really matters but I dated L when I was like 15 so it's not like this was a first time thing.  So, instead of indulging her at all, I told her exactly as follows - ""Fuck off you slut.  Find someone else to deepthroat."" Also I had a gf at the time, which I'm pretty sure she was aware of, but not certain. Now my question is, AITA for saying this?  In my eyes, I feel that I was justified, but I really don't know given that words like slut can have so many connotations and be really hurtful.

Edit:  Okay thanks for everyone's feedback.  One thing I think would be worth clearing up is that she was very public about her sex life.  In my experience, almost every conversation involved who she was with, her bodycount, etc.  I was loose friends with her for several years, so I heard it all directly from her.  As for everyone asking about the guys, how many girls they've slept with is not important for the story itself.  Most of them, I don't even know, as L frequently dates guys from her town which is an hour from mine.  Don't know if this would change anything, but thought some clarity might help.

I can give a million reasons for why I don't want to do it, but the main one is that I feel like if people come over to my home that they can cope with not being online for that time. This only applies to phones, and literally everyone I have around does have both regular calls, messaging, and data plans for their phones, so it's not keeping people from contacting them in case of emergency or otherwise.

If someone needed to use a computer or game system while over, I would be happy to enter the password for them.

1865,"AITA for eating ketchup My wife has always really hated the smell of certain condiments. Mostly ketchup, certain BBQ sauces (not all) and mayo. She says it is the smell and consistency but mostly the smell. She gets physically sick. For the most part it is just annoying. They aren’t really big deals at the house. She will buy them for us to eat and just leave the room when we consume them or step away. If she can’t or smell them (like at a restaurant with a lot of smells or when we cook in the kitchen and we can hid it in a bun or she can set away from it at the table). If she smells it she will gag or throw up and looks really pale. She talked to her doctor once and he just told her that some people were more sensitive to certain smells than others and he generally just suggested not going around that smell. 

During the holidays we took a long road trip and on the way home the kids wanted to stop for dinner. We really wanted to get home to make an event my wife needed to attend for work so my wife drove while the kids and I ate some carry out in the car. She wasn’t hungry. My youngest got a ketchup packet and opened it. She rolled down his window but that set the oldest off wanting ketchup and then I wanted ketchup too. She didn’t seem mad at the kids but she told me she was upset at me for disrespecting the fact that I joined in with the kids while we were in a enclosed place she couldn’t get away from the smell since I was sitting right next to her. 

She eventually had to pull over and get out of the car at a station. She looked stayed out of the car until the kids and I finished eating and helped us clean up the car and get the smell out. She was still feeling sick after so I took over driving and she spent about 10 minutes with her head near the window.

We later talked about her thinking I was disrespectful because she said I knew she would have an issue because the space was so enclosed. She said the kids are one thing but I should know better. I don’t think I did anything wrong because she is often over dramatic about the smells and the eating lasted a brief time. She was the one who didn’t want to stop. I voted for stopping.

1867,"AITA for bringing up a common problem to my dance instructor? So my friend is a dance instructor, and he has been teaching for quite a bit. In partner dancing, you dance in couples, and you rotate partners so that you get to dance with everyone. Everyone you dance with has a different skill set. You will be dancing with beginners, and you will be dancing with experts. When the instructor says ""rotate"" you are expected to move on quickly so he can get right to the next set of instruction. 

&#x200B;

One problem we deal with all the time is people--i.e. beginners who just finished learning all the basic moves--who wanna teach their partners or correct them on what they're doing wrong. Teaching your partner causes lags in the rotations. These people who like to do this are in the class not as teachers. I told him privately after class ""I think all the teaching should be done by you. You are the instructor. And you are a great teacher, and it was a great lesson. But there are people on the bad end of [Dunning-Kruger](https://www.intelligentspeculation.com/blog/the-dunning-kruger-effect) who think they are qualified to teach everyone and as a result cut into when it's time to rotate. This is by no means an affront to how the class is run. I hope this isn't a frequent problem, but I've seen this everywhere."" That's the summary of what I told him.

I was in no way trying to tell him how to teach his class; I did this with the intention of bringing up a frequent problem with the students that tends to affect the class.

It's entirely possible to fully love your wife, and still miss your ex. That said, I think you could've worded your post differently to be just a bit more sensitive to your wife. Something along the lines of ""remembering you today"" rather than ""I will always miss you"" would've relayed the same sentiment, without making your wife feel like you're pining after a past love. 

Other commentators are saying that your wife is insecure, which she might be, but it's a difficult situation for her to be in. She might logically understand that jealousy or insecurity over a dead woman is completely irrational, but that doesn't stop her from feeling that emotion. I've done the same dance with my current partner. I'd advise you to offer her some reassurance, and keep an open dialogue about your feelings and your ex with her, if you don't already.",1,YTA,1.0,1.0,1

Several months ago, I let a good friend of mine stay at my house for a couple weeks as he was moving and his new place wasn't quite ready yet. We agreed that he would pay $200 for his time at my house. (He just gave me half last weekend.)  


Recently, my neighbors put up a new fence, which turned our connected driveway into 2 very narrow driveways. Now when he was moving some of his stuff to my shed in the back, I told him to be very careful not to hit their fence or the house! Well, he drove the Uhaul all the way behind the house, which is in no way big enough for a Uhaul and then tried to back out of the narrow driveway, hitting the a corner of the roof, which annoyed the shit out of me because I rent my house and specifically told him not to hit the house. Nonetheless, he reassured me that he would pay for it and I wouldn't have to do anything. About a week later, he told me his old landlord, a super shady dude, could make repairs for $300. Since, I didn't want my friend to get scammed, I called up a roofing company to get a quote. They said they needed to get in contact with my landlady, so I got them her contact info.   


Now, while they, landlady and roofing company, hashed things out, my friend gave me the $300 for the repairs and he set up a date for the old landlord to show up. So that day comes around, and I wake up to someone fixing the roof. I'll be honest I wasn't especially upset that the roof, but I had not authorized it since I hadn't heard back from landlord. So I called her and let her know what was going on and she was not happy. She was going to have the roofing company come and look at the roof to see if they could replace the whole thing instead of just fix the corner. BIG OOF! Anyway, since the guy did the work, I paid him the $300. Then that weekend, my town had a huge storm which damaged the roof again along with the shed's roof. So my landlady went ahead and got the roofing company to replace the roofs and told me that if I could produce an invoice for the work the first guy did, then she would reimburse me $300!

1883,"AITA for not telling my Tinder date I'm polyamorous? For info on polyamory: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyamory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyamory)

Recently, I (32M) decided to learn something about human romantic relationships in this day and age. Five weeks ago, I downloaded Tinder, and matched with Haley (pseudonym, 30F), who's an hour's flight away. She decided to visit. Before she bought tickets, I explicitly told her I wasn't looking for anything exclusive or long-term -- that in fact I was leaving the country in a few months.

Haley said she recognized that when it came to Tinder, she understood that it was safe to assume people are dating multiple others simultaneously. She stated that while her body count was over 20, her last one night stand was over a year ago, and she had no intention of living that lifestyle anymore.

Though I am polyamorous, I didn't mention it. I did not think it was important to share for a casual relationship. (Note that polyamory usually refers to more serious relationships.)

Haley's current and former lifestyles were both fine by me. I told her that if she were to visit, we'd both have to be okay with the possibility that things may or may not work out a certain way.

She got tickets, and I got a larger bed. I used my original bed to set up a guest room, so we had options.

We chatted for three weeks, and half the messages were sexually charged. We shared STI test results, and I was satisfied Haley was clean (as am I). In my mind, I was entirely happy if she wanted to be friends platonically; but I also wanted to be prepared if she decided to get frisky.

The night before her arrival, Haley reiterated that she was not after a short-term fling. I was okay with this, and I told her I was looking forward to meeting her, anyway. She then told me that she was disappointed that I was still updating my Tinder. I suggested talking it out over the phone.

She felt misled. Given our prior conversations, I was surprised. She asked me why I thought she'd be willing to travel so far if all she wanted was something casual (as she had easy options at home); and she told me she had a few dozen Tinder conversations which she hadn't bothered replying to, since she was busy chatting with me. I told her that she was welcome to reply to those people, since I happened to be a fan of egalitarian polyamorous relationships.

Haley told me that if I was polyamorous I should have had it in my bio to begin with, to not waste her time. Breaking from her previous messages, she also told me that she had absolutely no physical attraction to me, to which I was completely unfazed (as I am ludicrously overconfident in my worth as a boy toy).

I decided not to mention to her that I had gotten laid a few times since we had started talking.

Since she was pretty upset over the cost of the tickets, and since it didn't make much difference to me, I offered to reimburse her (which she took me up on).

I gave her portion of salmon fillet to my flatmate's doggo: [https://imgur.com/a/IKFYkQu](https://imgur.com/a/IKFYkQu)

1920,"AITA for playing a ""boiling rabbit"" prank on my boyfriend? Using a throwaway and going to have to give some background. 

I have been dating a guy I've fallen deeply in love with for about a year (I'm 22). He is everything I could have ever wanted in a guy and one of the things I love most about him is his understanding and his humor. On Tuesday night we were really stoned and laughing and he asked me what the worst thing I'd ever done was. I guess it was the drugs but I'd shared something with him that I'd only hinted at before. 

When I was 15-18 I was a literal sugar baby for married man in his 40s/50s. For the most part I lived a normal teenage life but once a week or so I spent with this guy. I don't really see myself as a victim because I was a willing participant but I also understand how there can't really be a relationship like without the younger party being a victim. When the guy ended it with me I was devastated and I called his wife, sent pics, receipts, texts...everything. It destroyed the guys family, his work and I have no idea what happened to him after that. 

I'd hinted that I'd dated much older guys but I guess the combination of being high and trusting my boyfriend, I told him everything. He sort of freaked out but I wasn't sure what he was upset about. He made a joke like ""well at least don't boil my rabbit"" (It's from a movie called Fatal Attraction, about a scorned woman) and it seemed everything was fine. 

So I decided to play a prank on him and on Wednesday, I bought a cheap stuffed rabbit and literally boiled it on his stove. Instead of him finding and seeing it for the joke it was supposed to be, he freaked out. He said he now questioned both my past and current decision making. That I was making a joke out of a situation that I should be ashamed of. Then he changed his tone and said I was a victim and that I shouldn't joke about that either. I tried to explain to him that I don't know how I feel about that situation but he wasn't helping me. He told me to leave and I did. 

I haven't heard from him and he hasn't answered my texts. I have no idea what to think. Am I an asshole for doing this?",YTA. You definitely missed where he was going when he freaked out about your confession and then made it even worse with the joke. He probably took it as don’t you ever fuck me over.

1923,"WIBTA for asking my parents to pay me back with wheel of cheese? I’m on mobile, my apologies.
Now I shall tell y’all about my situation:

There is this cheese called Epoisse that I’ve been wanting to try for years since my parents talked about tasting it for the first time. I decided to buy a wheel with my own money to share with my family to celebrate the completion of my first year at uni. The wheel was not exactly cheap, as it was $21.99 a pop (note: the wheel was pretty small). I was to leave for Paris for a study abroad later that month, so I wanted to eat the cheese before I left. I had asked them at least five or six times  to eat the cheese with me but they kept putting it off to the point where I ultimately lost the chance to enjoy it with them. I was pretty bummed out because I really wanted to eat the cheese with wine  with them to really have some family time before I left (after all, my parents are the ones who have been urging me to spend time with them). They promised to eat it with my sister, which I settled with, as I did not want the cheese to go to waste. 
I did end up trying the Epoisse in France because it turned out to be cheaper there—IT WAS DELICIOUS!!! 
Fast forward to today (I returned this past Monday), when I discovered the wheel of cheese completely spoiled and untouched in my fridge. Even though it’s just cheese, I honestly felt really upset about it. I bought this cheese for something special and for an opportunity to be together with my family. 

Considering that I paid the cheese with my own money and wanted to eat it with them, only for them to put it off and let it go to waste, I’m considering whether or not it would be reasonable to ask them to buy me a new wheel of cheese as a form of compensation. My sister thinks I’m being petty, since it is just a piece of cheese. So, WIBTA if I asked?

Edit: based on the answers I’ve gotten so far, I think that I am being a dickhead. I think that My sister is right that I am being petty.",I genuinely don't understand why you would think you might be entitled to compensation here.

Later, I found that her best friend had posted a facebook story at a nightclub, which my girlfriend was in. So wasn't at home sick, but was out clubbing. We fought over text for a long time and eventually she stopped answering and she was really drunk. The next day she came back and apologised and I forgave her. We made a deal that neither would go to a club or bar without the other. And no lying. She said that the reason she went to the club was that her friend was laughing at our relationship because we were fighting and convinced her to go to the club and lie about it.

Since then, That friend that she was with, is constantly asking my partner to go to clubs (without me present). The friend knows about the deal we made, but still asks anyway.

1928,"WIBTA if I cut contact with several members of my family for forgetting my birthday? Please excuse the formatting as I’m writing on a mobile;

I’m not sure if I’m being petty here, but it was my 35th birthday a few days ago and none of my immediate family (dad, mom, stepdad, 3 older siblings + partners and kids) wished me happy birthday or acknowledged my bday in any way until 9pm when ONE sibling and their partner finally got in touch via messenger, but even a few days later there’s still nothing at all from the rest. 

I’m bouncing between being angry and sad at the moment and don’t know whether to call them out for forgetting or just leave it alone and not contact any of them again. I will admit that I’m not always great at sending cards and gifts out exactly on time, but am usually no more than a day late sending stuff and ALWAYS acknowledge an event via a text/call/Facebook post on the correct date, so it stings that I haven’t even had a text message saying happy birthday. 

I should point out that my immediate family are not the closest of people (geographically or emotionally) but have always maintained a level of contact where we see each other a few times a year for special occasions/holidays etc and we always send cards to each other for birthdays and Christmas if we aren’t seeing each other around the time. However, I last saw my mom and stepdad 3 weeks ago at a family party where they acknowledged my birthday was coming up and asked what I’d be doing, so it’s not like that didn’t know (and let’s face it, my mom should remember giving birth to me-I’m pretty sure she was there!). 

Right now I’m trying to figure out if I’ve done something wrong and it’s a deliberate ‘f*** you’ from my family to completely ignore me (I can’t think of anything in the last 3 weeks that could’ve caused that to be the case though) or if I just mean so little to them that they all forgot...

We've been talking for a while about adopting a dog when I move in and I've been researching rescues and sending my mom listings for potential dogs. I move in in about a week, but until then I'm on the other side of the country.

On Saturday, I sent my mom a listing for a pretty cute puppy and mentioned it will be at an adoption event that day in case she wanted to do a meet and greet. A few hours later she sent me a text that she has adopted the puppy and is bringing her home.

Now, this wouldn't be a big deal if it was her dog, but we've been very clear that this is MY dog. I'm the primary care taker for it, she expects me to refund her the adoption fees, I'll be the one picking out a vet, taking it to training classes, etc.

I blew up at her for adopting the dog without so much as a phone call to consult and let me make a decision. She says that she considered the dog to be approved by me since I sent her the listing, and that ""what else was I supposed to do?"" at an adoption event. She hasn't done any vetting of the dog since ""all shelter dogs are the same"" and didn't bother checking if the dog is suitable for our family in terms of health needs or personality or energy levels or anything (shes only had purebred dogs before).

1933,"AITA for ruining the day because of a petty argument? So some quick context: I and two of my friends, who I will call friend A and friend B, are three weeks away from our college finals. Since all three of us are gamers and we usually play together, we agreed that we wouldn't play together during the day to avoid procastination. 

This morning friend A sent us a message, asking if we wanted to play. I reminded him of the rule, and we left it at that. Afterwards, I got a message from an online friend that wanted to talk to me/show me something real quick in a game. So I went into the game, and immediately I get messages from both A and B saying ""Wow, you said no to playing ealier but now you're in-game? Ok."" I tell them that I was going into the game for a quick thing, and that didn't go against the rule since it was about playing together. I said they're the ones upset over nothing. I also mentioned that friend A would usually listen to study material while gaming, so them being upset for me going into a game for 5 minutes was really hypocritical.

That's when the argument broke out. They argued for the fact that it was rude for me to say no to playing and then immediately after going into another game alone. I said I was in it for 5 minutes max, and that me playing shouldn't bother them. I then mentioned that I'm even ahead of my study schedule and asked if they can say the same, and that it should be none of their business that I procastinate. 

I then got a bit petty (unusual for me) and decided to say that it's always you two against me, and that I didn't appreciate how they always had shade to throw at me. I critisised friend A for breaking the rule we had come up with, and he excused it with I forgot. When I said the study schedule thing he mentioned that he's sick and couldn't study. Fair enough, I wished him ""Get well"".

After a bit more arguing that my procastination and solo gaming should be none of their business, friend B (who wasn't involved in most of the arguing) sent us an all caps message and told us to shut up, since she can't concentrate due to the notifications. I responded ""If I don't want to?"" She then responded that I should respect her studying, again in all caps. I told her about the scheduled do not disturb feature on the phone and left it at that. Later she sent a voicemail where she sobbed and said that I ruined her day.

You can do two judgements here: Was I an asshole from the start and was I an asshole by the end? I feel like somewhat of an ass by the end, but I didn't really do anything to upset her before the end, since the argument mainly ran between me and A.

TLDR: Friend A asks us to game, I remind him of a rule between us against that. I then enter a game alone, friend A and B argue against me doing that and in the end friend B tells me I ruined her day due to the argument.

Today we got to know that it will most likely be a girl.

I don't get along with small children and don't really like them. I often get anxious about the world's situation and overpopulation.

My father has had several relationships, one of them which lasted for a long time and was really bad, leaving me a little skeptical when it comes to new spouses.

She's quite vain - she thought canes were ugly so she was extra motivated to religiously practice her walking and balance - and gets embarrassed easily. However, she probably understands my POV, which is probably why she hasn't complained yet. She just makes passive aggressive comments about being sorry about how slow she was. 

&#x200B;

My relatives have since sent angry messages that I'm being cruel for forcing my mum to fend for herself in public. They think that we should let my mum practice at home to save her the embarrassment. I think practicing in an artificial environment is not as effective as practicing in real life. My mum's OT agrees with me. 

&#x200B;

TLDR: AITA for forcing my mum to be more independent post-stroke?","YTA, a little bit. You can balance encouraging your mum to do things independently with general kindness, and saving her embarrassment in front of family is a kindness you can do without compromising her recovery. It sounds like she's trying very hard, so she doesn't need you to ""force"" her to be more independent. And doing things at home isn't an ""artificial environment."" Home is as much ""real life"" as a public space is.

Due to illness I need help with some things, and I find it very difficult when well-meaning friends and relatives push me to do something because they think it's good for me. The reality is that I'm pushing myself, all the time, much more than most people realise. I don't need other people to push me, and there are times when I do really appreciate help.",1,YTA,1.0,1.0,0

1955,"WIBTA for reporting a professor for not really caring about a students prejudiced comments towards me? So I’m in college. I was born in America but my parents immigrated from South Africa to America 3 years before I was born (I have 2 older siblings) I’m in this social issue source that’s very discussion based and a topic came up about western view points about Africa and how we are often told a “single story”. We were divided into groups to talk it and I decided to talk about my perspective as an African and how people don’t usually view me as African.  But then someone in the group groaned. He then said that I was not really African. I said I was born in America but my parents were South African and my older siblings were born in South Africa. He said that I was the descendant of colonizers who terrorized the population and that my family were probably racists who ran away from South Africa as soon as black people got rights. 


I was really offended by this and felt he was making assumptions about me and  my family so after class I decided to report him to the professor for harassment. However the prof seemed completely indifferent and said that maybe we could discuss it as a class next period. I thought this was unacceptable and kinda want to report the professor. I mentioned this to my friend and he thinks this would be a dick move and I’m making a big deal out of nothing and being dramatic. 


WIBTA for reporting the professor?","YTA. If you're born in the US, you're an American. Yes, you have a unique perspective being of South African descent, and what your classmate said was rude. But you're in *college*, ffs. Grow up and have a conversation about it instead of tattle-taling to your professor. A lot of white South Africans are, in fact, the descendants of colonizers who terrorized and oppressed the black population. It's possible that your ancestors weren't, and certainly possible you and your family aren't racist, but if you want to have discussions about the history of South African culture and politics, you need to be prepared to tackle these difficult topics in a mature way without immediately jumping to being offended.",1,YTA,0.0,0.0,0
1957,"AITA for expecting a house warming present? This had happened a few months ago, but it left me wondering if I was the AH. 

I (27F) bought a house a year ago with my own savings, as a family home for me and my husband. My husband is a full-time student, so we depend on only my income (this is relevant for later). Prior to this I had been renting for the last 7 years and moved on average every two years due to the landlord selling or wanting to move back into the flat themselves. 

My sister (28F) married a year ago to a man from overseas and has recently managed to bring him over. In the meantime she has secured a flat to rent, near to her workplace and she and her husband have both moved in. A week after she moved in, my brother (M23) bought her an item of furniture for £150. Prior to finding out about this gift from him, I was helping my sister unpack and settle in. I noticed a cute wall hanging and asked her where she got it, and she commented that it was a house warming present from our brother. I asked if he got her anything else, and she mentioned some cute floral mugs but didn't comment any further. 

My older sister (F33) mentioned what a generous gift my brother had given to our sister, and to my surprise, mentioned this item of furniture. I don't know if I was an asshole to feel hurt I did not receive anything, and I actually bought a house which was a big deal. It isn't the price tag, I don't care how much he spent on her, I just felt hurt he didn't get me anything. I saved up for 7 years whilst renting to be able to afford to buy my own home. Even when I did manage to get on the property ladder, I couldn't afford to furnish my home, and only had a sofa, TV and a mattress. It wasn't until 6 months later until I could afford bedroom furniture and a dining table set. I do not expect my family to help me afford furniture in any way, I was more than content with what I had and just happy I was no longer renting, of which I had previously done so for years. 

I texted my brother asking what he bought our sister and he confirmed the item of furniture. I responded with a jokey text just saying he won't have to spend too much on a gift for me. He replied he was just going to give me some cash the next time he sees me. I couldn't help feel hurt as I bought a house a year ago, and this was a significant achievement for me. This was my sisters first time renting as prior to this she was living at home with our parents. We both earn a similar wage, and recently her husband got a full-time job  as he is legally allowed to work. So I don't think any disparity in income influenced my brother's decision. 

My brother did give me £50 the next time he saw me, of which I was very grateful for and thanked him. 

AITA for expecting a house warming present?","YTA for bringing it up, yeah. Even if you couldn't afford to furnish your home, if you can afford to buy one, you're doing better than most. Asking your brother for a gift, and taking cash from him, seems greedy. I know you worked hard and saved hard to buy a home, but you can't expect other people to reward you for that.

1959,"AITA for not helping my cousin deal with my dads old lawsuit? 
While he was still alive in the hospital he told me to get all of his valuables he had left. Which wasn’t very much. Just some old tools he got from his dad, his furniture, my mom engagement ring that was all back at his apartment. He also said I could take any other personal items of his that I wanted.  I ended up taking all his old pictures, sketchbooks, and some of his clothes.

He also warned me to absolutely not accept anything from his estate and to properly disclaim any inheritance. His company was small and not worth a whole lot as it didn’t have any assets. It did though have a lawsuit against it at the time, which is why my dad wanted me to disclaim any inheritance from him so I wouldn’t have to deal with it as how his company was set up it didn’t limit the owners liability. To be honest I don’t get how it all works, but I trusted he knew what was up.

So after he died a little while later I did just that. Didn’t accept anything. Wrote a disclaimer and had it notorized and everything.

My dad had put all his funeral arrangements in his will and paid for it so I didn’t have to deal with that and it all seems fine. Or at least as fine as it could be when your dad dies.

Anyway my cousin who I had forgotten all about as I haven’t seen or talked to in probably over 15 years contacted me on Facebook. I guess my dad had forgotten about her too because she didn’t know about this whole mess and had inherited everything left of my dads.

Shes super fucking pissed because she got the lawyer from the lawsuit contacting her as the new owner of the company and when she went to go to my dads place everything had been cleared out already and how somehow she’s going to end up owing money after everything is through which she can’t afford because she’s already in debt and has kids to take care of.

She ended the message saying I need to take care of this and help her. So am I the asshole if I don’t? It really is a huge mess and her anger at my dad isn’t something I want to deal with right now. While I feel bad that it all got pushed on her I have a lot of other things going on right now to deal with all that. Don’t even think there’s anything I can do to help.","YTA.

1962,"AITA For not wanting my boyfriend to text his ex? A little context boyfriend is 21 and I'm 19. We have been dating for almost 3 years.

His ex randomly texted him for relationship advice because she ""thinks it's turning into the same relationship that they had"". 

A little more context they were together for about a year, it was long distance relationship, and my boyfriend was very controlling with her. He asked her not to go to parties (even if they didn't have alcohol), asked to skype him instead of hanging out with her friends (isolating her), and all around was very needy. He would message her obsessively and if she got home a few minutes late from school he would bombard her with questions asking where she was and why it took so long for her to get home ect. She broke up with him with no warning blocked him on all social media and didn't talk to him for 4 years. 

He saw that she unblocked him on instagram and asked me if it was okay if he messaged her to get closure. I said yes, because it would make our relationship stronger and he could finally stop wondering why. 

She told him that he emotionally fucked her up for many years so much so that she needed therapy. He apologized up and down because he didn't realize just how much he hurt her. She said that she was in a happy relationship and thanked him for his apology.

After they finished talking for about 3 days here and there i asked my bf to stop messaging her if he got closure because it makes me uncomfortable for them to be talking. We got in a huge fight. His argument was ""what if I need this, what if its helping me get closure and maybe by being her friend i can make it up to her"".

I made the dumb mistake of saying that it is okay for them to text as long as it isn't very often, but even so when she texted him about relationship advice a couple months later, and comparing her current relationship to theirs just rubbed me the wrong way.

I just am not comfortable with him being in contact with someone he was in love with/had sexual relation with.

1964,"AITA for giving my vegan cousin’s kids animal produce Okay so I’ll start this off by saying maybe I am the asshole. I’m a student so I have all summer off, I had a week off work last week and my cousin was going away, she asked if I would look after her two kids (age 7 twins) for 4 days. I happily obliged as they’re great kids and I hadn’t seen them in a while.

So my cousin is a hardcore vegan, she’s almost militant in her ways. Her kids have never eaten any animal produce. I totally support veganism and was vegetarian for years but I feel that the effect this is having on her kids is harmful, growing children need nutrients. The kids are very frail, pale and they’re constantly getting sick, they lack the energy and enthusiasm that most 7 year olds have. 

The first day they stayed I made all vegan food for myself and the kids, as their mother instructed. The kids were becoming curious about the food I had in the house, even normal everyday things like eggs and cheese. They asked if they could have some. For breakfast the next day I made them eggs and toast with butter and they LOVED it. They had never eaten it before and it lit up their little faces, I just couldn’t say no to them for the rest of the week. I didn’t give them that much meat because I know their digestive systems wouldn’t be used to it but we tried a small bit of fish and chicken. 

They were totally different kids for the time they stayed with me. They had so much energy and got really involved in every activity I planned, I had never seen them like that before and neither had the rest of my family.

Their mom picked them up on Wednesday afternoon and within half an hour I received a very angry phone call from her. She told me that I had no right to feed her kids “poison” and that they will never be seeing me again.

So AITA here?

Edit: 
CPS has been called on her before. They did an inspection and didn’t deem her unfit to parent. I’ve been through the care system before and honestly have very little belief in them because they allowed me to stay in an abusive environment when it was obvious what was going on.

It may have to do with my mom marrying another dude few months after my dads death. Never went to therapy so Idk.

I assured him that i was happy for them but it's just not my thing and I'm too old to change it. He literally ignored me  and said that he wanted me to be his best man. I politely rejected. Then tess went mad at me. She went on saying that I was a jerk for not wanting to attend and that their wedding night is the most important night of their lives and they wanted me to be a part of it.

1966,"AITA for expecting my female friend to meet with me after I helped her? I (25M) met a friend online 4 years ago, She is called Sophie. Over the years she's opened up to me about her personal problems, and together I've supported Sophie and given her advice to help her solve her problems, many of which she has now conquered. Whilst doing this, I've had to sacrifice hours to assist her whenever she's had a mental breakdown. I never expect anything in return.


It just so happens that me and sophie live close together, but despite growing close together we didn't meet up for a long time. This is because Sophie has severe social anxiety and is scared of men in general. Despite this, Sophie goes to a biannual cosplay convention and told me she would be happy to go with me and my friends as a group. Me and Sophie met 1 year ago at this convention. 

After the convention I asked her if she would like to go out together more, and she said yes, and that I should invite her out every month or so. I invited her out for 11 months (once a month) and each time Sophie declined my invitation. 

Last Month was the bi annual cosplay. I asked Sophie if she wanted to go but she said she found a cosplay group to go with, these are complete strangers and whilst she uncomfortable around people she is somehow able to tolerate being in a group of 30 people. I then asked Sophie if we could meet on the day, since I was also going to the convention, meeting her is very important to me, and it something I've told her many times, since I can only meet her at best 2 times a year. She told me that she didn't want to meet me (as in set a time/location), as she would feel like she has no control. But she said if we bumped into each other she would be happy to talk/take photos together. 

I didn't get to meet sophie at the convention, but my friend Matt, told me that it doesn't even sound like Me and sophie are friends, if she capable of setting a time/location to meet with a bunch of strangers, but cannot spend a few minutes to meet with me to say hello, especially when meeting IRL is such an important value I hold close (which Sophie knows) and the fact that we are close friends.

2 weeks after the convention Sophie posted an image of her and 3 people from the group she was with out shopping. Meaning that she's known these people for 3 weeks but has met them twice and is comfortable enough to meet them. I messaged Sophie saying that I felt underappreciated, explaining that I've always helped her out and did stuff I didn't want to do in order to assist her with her problems, but she doesn't want to do minor things which can help me. Sophie told me I was being entitled for thinking that because we are friends shes expected to put herself in an uncomfortable situation in order for me to be happy.

We didn't have any mutuals but I followed her back and we started DMing. She is a beautiful solid 10 and works as a doctor. 

I took her on a date last week and we had a great time and kissed at the end of it. 

Earlier this week I met up with my best friend Harriet who I have known since I was a kid. I told her about my date but when I showed her Alicia's picture she was very angry. 

Harriet is a nurse and the two of them work in the same department at the same hospital. Harriet does not like Alicia. She claims that she is a snob who is constantly rude to her and humiliates her at every opportunity. She told me that Alicia saw her on a video call to me on a lunch break, and after she was done said I was cute and tried to pester her for my details. 

Harriet refused but Alicia didn't give up, even said she would stop tormenting her at work if she convinced me to go out with her. 

At one point I was chatting to Harriet over text and she left her phone for a minute or so. According to Harriet this is when Alicia took her chance. Harriet has my number saved as my full name so that was all Alicia needed to look me up on social media. 

Harriet was annoyed with me but understood that I didn't know and we're OK. I phoned up Alicia later and demanded the truth, and she started crying admitting that she did look on Harriet's phone, but it was only on impulse and she didn't plan to do it. She said how sorry she was and begged me to please not dump her over this. I took some time to think about it but in the end we started talking again and met up yesterday. Alicia said she didn't understand why anyone would want to be friends with Harriet but we had a great time again and she invited me to come back home with her. 

We had a great night and by the morning she asked if I'd like to be ''exclusive'' with her. I said I needed time which upset her. I would like to be but I feel like that would really damage my friendship with Harriet. She was fuming when I told her how Alicia found me and I don't think she'd be happy if she became my girlfriend. 

Alicia is a gorgeous, funny, bubbly and lovely person who I really want to see more of but I have a gut feeling that I am betraying my friendship with Harriet.

I assured her that I’d never do something like that, so we made our first sextape and it was AMAZING. We’ve continued to do so for the past year and now we have our own little library of sextapes.

Phoebe offered to help do driving to help pick up Lisa from the airport, and to drive Lisa and I around to do sight-seeing and stuff, since she knows I don't like driving. She said she could take a week off from work to help with driving and helping to train the dog (my dog is in training for aggression). She asked which week she should take off.

In the first week, we (me, Lisa, my sister, and my niece) are doing a road trip five hours away to see my daughter and her family, and Phoebe is staying home to dogsit my dog and my sister's dog.

She is the oldest child and the first grandchild on both sides of our family. I would call her spoiled but that brings the wrong images. What she had was all the attention she could ever want. I do feel bad for her for this. Most of her life seems to be trying to recapture having this amount of attention.

She has a long history of drug and alcohol abuse. She would disappear for years at a time. When she reappeared she was always in need of money and would claim she was a changed person. This would last long enough that we'd believe her.

I was in college when she had one of these ""changes."" I knew better than to believe her but she was family. I made the mistake of asking college friends about this. They told me I was TA and I needed to forgive her. This time she remained in contact with the family for a few years.

It was a year or two after I got out of college that a long time family friend came out as Trans. This friend lost a lot of friends and a lot of family and our whole family was invested in supporting her. A week or two after this my sibling called me. She told me she was Trans. I instinctively believed she was only doing this for attention. But I was struggling to learn about Trans and just didn't know what to do. So I did the only thing that felt right. I told her I loved her and accepted her no matter what gender she identified as. Then, from my experience with the family friend, I realized how difficult it would be to instantly refer to her by her proper pronouns having known her for 20+ years at that point. I told her this and asked for a little grace as I struggled to do this. She agreed.

Next Saturday was my birthday. I'd already invited all my siblings and cousins to play an online video game with me to celebrate. She came but she had purchased an airhorn. Everytime someone misgendered her she blew the airhorn into her mic. I was pretty pissed.

Some point soon after that she went no contact with the family again. I decided after that to not bother trying to change my way of speaking about her.

She has just recently got back in contact with some of the family. When speaking about her I am still misgendering her and using her old name. Other family members have called me TA for this. I'll probably change my language around them. Outside the family and to others who like me think she is only Trans for attention I fully plan on continuing to misgender her. So AITA?",YTA - no matter how much of a dick she is misgendering her is petty and an asshole move.,1,YTA,0.0,0.0,1
1979,"AITA for getting sensitive company info out if someone at a intercompany function by encouraging them to drink more and flirting quite heavily? This was a few months ago but after discussing it with my friend earlier I thought I should put it to you good people. 

My company uses something their company makes. We are a massive customer and they are the market leaders. 

There was a big intercompany function of dinner and drinks and dancing and along with a few other people from my company I went along. It is worth nothing that the industry is about 99.9% men so out of around 50 people there was only one woman other than myself. 

This was my first time with my senior bosses at an event like that so i stayed sober but it seemed most people were enjoying the libations. 

I started chatting to a guy flirting and having a laugh asking some leading questions about the product that his company supplies mine. He gave me loads of information, more than I could have ever wanted. This did include some very sensitive propriety stuff. Whilst we were talking he thought I was drinking alcohol but I was on soft drinks and gently teased him that he was falling behind on drinks etc and flirting quite heavily to keep him talking. (I was single at the time fyi)

I passed this on to my team the next day and left the guy alone at the table when he started getting quiet. Nothing further happened and my team left the function soon after.

1981,"WIBTA if I put a permanent sticker on cars stopped in the crosswalk? Literally every single day, as I walk from the train station to my office, the same two intersections have people who run the red light, get stuck in the intersection, and block the crosswalk. This has happened enough that I've even been able to get a photo of the same driver doing it twice. Full disclosure, I'm angry. In my city, a pedestrian is killed every three days. 

I looked online, and I can obtain semi-permanent vinyl stickers that read ""If you can read this, I'm blocking the crosswalk. Again."" It's $200 for 1000 stickers. The only way I would even be able to put these on the car in the first place is if I have to walk around it, onto the road or the intersection.

1982,"AITA for not letting my niece drag me into her drama? I was 14 when my niece was born. We were always very close even though I always had a strained relationship with her mother, my older sister. I helped raise my niece until I moved across the country when she was a teen. We talked here and there and she visited me a few times but we're not as close as we used to be. I've gotten married and started a family of my own. 

She's 30 now. Last year she cut the whole family out of her life. I was very heartbroken. Before she did it, she sent me a long email bashing her parents, mostly her mother. She said that her mother ""severely"" neglected and abused her while doting on her son, my niece's younger brother. She shared a lot of personal and disturbing information with me and I was uncomfortable knowing all those things because i respect my sister's privacy. My niece said she tried to work it out with her mother many times but her mother either ignored her or verbally abused her. My niece decided to give up and say goodbye for good. 

My niece said that she wanted to give me the whole story to get me to understand why she cut ties with her immediate family. She said she still wanted a relationship with me. 

I called her and told her that I would not get in the middle of it. My sister had a rough upbringing and she has issues, but she loves my niece with all her heart. She has always talked about my niece with a lot of pride and joy. I think my niece may have exaggerated some things but I didn't tell her that. I told her that I would pray for her and I still wanted a relationship with her as long as she didn't bring up her issues with her mother again. She was silent for a few moments, and said ""OK"" then hung up. She never answered any of my calls or emails again. She cut me out, too. 

My husband thinks that I should've been more compassionate. But honestly I have my own problems to deal with. I don't have the time or energy to argue with my niece or my sister.

I'm a 28 year old guy, and my father is 57. I live in a different town than him, and we agreed that this weekend I will help him with some physical work (both Saturday and Sunday, the big work is on Sunday, and my brother would join us by then). 


First, we talk yesterday that I will arrive to his town around lunchtime on Saturday, which he responds okay. Then this morning at 9am, he calls  me and asks when I will arrive? I say around 2pm I believe, which he responds ""that's too late, nevermind"".


I arrive to the town at 2pm, thinking tomorrow we will work, but I've sent him a message anyway that I have arrived. He replies me 1 hour later that he is waiting for me, so I go to him. Then right away, he starts complaining why I did not go to him right after I arrived, trying to make me feel guilty. I said because he told me my arrival is too late. He did not accept this, so we started arguing, he got upset, then told me to leave as he no longer needs my help.

1990,"AITA for wanting to know how much I hurt someone? A few weeks ago I ruined an amazing friendship with someone I greatly loved and admired. It was because of my unhealthy behavior entirely and I do take blame for that. Essentially, I struggle with mild drug abuse and it is my go to when I’m extremely anxious and depressed. For the last year or two I’ve had a great friend who was extremely supportive through all this. One night, while mixing alcohol and ambien to cope I mentally disconnected and walked to my friend’s house and just entered their home without their knowledge. This is a horrific thing I did and I feel profound remorse and guilt for it. They cut me out and we haven’t been friends since. 

Now we have three classes together at university, so I see them fairly often. We also live just two doors apart from each other. We agreed to act normal in person, and thus far we have. The other day we ended up just sitting and talking for half the day while we did school work in the lab. We had normal personal convos and shared shit. So that part has remained true. 

But today I asked if we could have a smoke tomorrow and that I’d bum them one. They snapped and said “We are not friends. If playing chess is too familiar I will stop.” (Because we still play chess together on the phone). To which I just said “Jesus Christ. I know we aren’t friends. If anything Chess reinforces that. I wasn’t asking out of friendship or some shit so dont treat me like I’m some monster. I dont deserve that” Blah blah blah. They just said “So don’t ask to hang outside of a professional setting” I explained I just had a question to ask and I figured a smoke would be fine because its quick and we’ve smoked together a few times since we stopped being friends. 

But then I followed up and asked for clarification on just how bad I fucked up (not worded in this way but essentially the same thing). Like we once actively expressed love for each other and we’re very caring and supportive of one another. I know what I did was bad and unhealthy, but I didn’t think it was enough to kill everything we ever shared and to fill them with enough hatred and anger that it killed the love and care we once shared. Is this an asshole thing to ask? They left me on read here and didn’t respond. But I’m thinking about asking again next time the chance permits in person. 

But I just don’t know. I feel guilt, I know I fucked up, I know I’m unhealthy, but I dont think I deserve to be treated with the same level of hatred that they give to the people that have literally assaulted them in the past. So the level of guilt and pain I have isn’t to that level, but if they feel that what i did was that horrid then they deserve for me to know that. ","YTA. If you're truly sorry, you don't get to dictate how they should treat you. They have a right to enforce boundaries, and if that's treating you like a ""monster"", you're basically saying they deserve no boundaries or respect from you. They didn't gaslight you or abuse you or break into your home or assault you - how is them telling you not to get too close ""treating you like a monster""? Just because you feel bad doesn't mean this person is actually harming you. Own your own feelings as well as your actions, and don't blame your feelings on this person. They did nothing wrong. 

Also, you don't get to decide what you ""deserve"" from them. As long as they're not abusing you, they have a right to treat you however they want. 

They obviously don't want to interact with you. You're aggressively pushing boundaries with explaining yourself when they didn't ask, telling them how to treat you, asking them for details on their feelings, etc. etc. Everything is about your needs and wants, and you sound super entitled; this might be why they might not want to be friends with someone like you who doesn't respect them at all. You don't get to decide that what you did ""wasn't enough to kill everything we shared blahblah"". If they treat you distantly, accept that it was enough to make them treat you that way.

1993,"AITA for ""breaking up"" with a friend because he and his fiance refuses to introduce me to a potential partner First of all this is all happening in a muslim country with moderate tension between religious and secular people.

So, I have coworker named let's say ""John"". He and I've been working together for a year and we've become pretty close friends. So close that I was a kind of pseudo-best man for his engagement, I took care of everything for the engagement party. I was also the only one he invited from the company.

John and his fiance ""Jane"" are very religious, on the contrary I am not. I'm not the neckbeard atheist type but if anyone asks I don't hide my religious beliefs or the lack of them. 

So the engagement party was a small affair, 30 or so people all family and friends. Almost all women were wearing headscarves etc. Not really the type of party you would mingle with the opposite sex. ""Jane"" had invited a few of her friends and they also wore headscarves except one girl. I didn't interact with any of them besides saying hello. 

Anyways, two weeks passed and John out of the blue said ""Hey, do you wanna meet with any of Jane's friends, they are single. But I guess you wouldn't wanna meet any of the girls wearing headscarves?"". I replied with ""I don't care if they are covering their hair or not but I don't think a religous girl would wanna meet me. Did any of the girls mentioned me to Jane?"" to which he replied ""No"". So I said ""Ok then, there was this girl not covering her hair, how about her?"". He was happy to do that and said she was a good person and single.

Two weeks passed so I asked John if Jane had asked the girl about me. He said no, he forgot but he will as soon as possible. Another week passed and I asked him again, this time he said he told Jane but she was dealing with family problems. So I said ""I don't need a formal introduction, just pass her phone number or instagram and I can ask her if she wants to meet."" to which he replied ""Sure, ok"". Another week passes and I again asked John about her and he told me I was too desperate. I reminded him that he was the one to suggest the whole thing, not me but he laughed it off.

Well a week passes again and I was pretty angry about the whole thing. I went to John and told him ""Don't bother, tell Jane not to ask her about me. I changed my mind, I don't even remember what she looks like."" He again laughed it off and said he asked Jane yesterday and I can't change my mind at this point, it would be offensive to the girl. I couldn't contain my anger and told him to fuck himself and that I would not be attending their fucking wedding.

Anyways I decided to cut ties with him because I feel his fiance thinks I'm a bad person since I'm not religious. I don't care about the friend,  I forgot what she looked like. But still him offering to introduce me then refusing to do so feels very immature. Moreover I'm starting realize practicing religious tolerance means nothing unless it's reciprocated. So am I the asshole for cursing him out and ""breaking up"" with him?

One of my closest friends at uni, Annie (who is in a long term relationship) came over one night to have a couple of drinks before heading to a party. One of our friends bailed and we didn’t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. 

My girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.

I told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.

The next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn’t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. 

My girlfriend did say that I hadn’t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn’t noticed that it had bothered her.

She said that the whole situation probably wouldn’t have bothered her if it weren’t for one conversation.

We have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other’s tastes-and I said Annie. 

After her pointing this out I feel like I’m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.

TL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.

Edit: Those who are saying ITA are right, I should have noticed how this was making my GF feel and obviously she comes first. When she told me how she felt I immediately apologised and have changed my behaviour with Annie.

However, those who think Annie wants me are just wrong.

We are “fine” with each other but they don’t like me very much. My gf (22F) has an older sister(24F) and a younger brother (21M). Her older sister has a fiancé (25M) that her family adores and absolutely falls all over who dislikes me, and her brother has a newish gf who everyone seems to love so far. So, I’m kind of the odd man out with the family not liking me. 

Every couple of years, my gf and her family will go to Colorado for Christmas to ski and snowboard and whatnot, and this year was one of those years. Their parents invited all of the SOs to come along, including me, so despite it all I still went to make my gf happy. 

They have several family traditions that they do during the week of Christmas such as decorating the tree which they did, but without me because I genuinely didn’t feel well which would seemingly be something they would understand. They also bake cookies and desserts on one night which I didn’t participate in because I’m shit at cooking and didn’t want to screw anything up, but this seemed to sour everyone. They also make a big show out of making and decorating gingerbread houses which is done on Christmas Eve but I didn’t participate in that because I honestly didn’t actually feel welcomed to participate after they’d made it clear they were not a fan of me. I did ski and snowboard with them, went to dinner with them and watched movies with them though. 

Cue last night , my girlfriend came into the room, mad at me that I didn’t participate and interact more with her family in their traditions and mentioned that everyone was kind of annoyed by me and my behavior as was she. I explained to her that it felt awkward being there with them like that and participating in their family moments when they don’t like me, it feels like they constantly compare me and her sisters fiancé to one another with him always coming out on top, and I didn’t want to watch them kiss his ass yet again added onto the fact that we can barely stand each other, and quite frankly I just didn’t want to get in their way as I figured it would make things worse. And to top it all off her brother made a post on Instagram that kind of shit on me as I wasn’t in the majority of pictures or participating in anything and then made a comment that I feel was really rude and could’ve been said in a kinder way. I told her these things but she still said I was jerk and said that I’d made this Christmas uncomfortable and upsetting for her because she was more worried about entertaining me and keeping me happy than she was about getting “precious family moments she could never get back” and I feel like that’s completely unfair to me since she asked me to come on this trip with her and would’ve been mad had I not gone.

I recently met up with a female friend. We also talked about dating and she mentioned how she'd been using Tinder and that she found it was easy to get matches but actually finding a good partner on it so far proved to be difficult. She then wanted to know what my experience with it was and I told her I didn't really use it. So what did I do then to meet girls, she asked.

I mentioned a few things and I also said that I'd started to talk to attractive Asian girls (since I have a bit of a thing for them anyway), who I presumed were Chinese (somewhat of a decent number in the city we're at), also asking if they spoke Chinese and then mentioning that I'd learned the language for a almost three years in college (I did) but that it was difficult to get actual practice now since I didn't really know many Chinese people. And later I'd ask if I could add her on WhatsApp since even writing with someone could be useful. After writing a bit some time later I might ask her if she'd sometime like to get coffee together, and so on.

This actually doesn't work that badly, only issue is that it doesn't work with Korean women, and you actually have to speak the language. But it's better than just talking to them for no reason, way better success rate. 

However my friend didn't seem to like my approach much. She argued it was insincere of me to claim it was for getting language practise when I was just trying to get with them. I tried to explain to her how being too direct wouldn't be good and that I of course also saw the additional practice as beneficial for myself but she argued that I should rather be honest and that if I was actually interested in the language I would also talk to Chinese guys or Asian girls who I didn't think were hot.

Essentially, my office (very small, around 20 employees) has an admin assistant. Many people order lunch during the week, and she goes to pick it up. She’s paid hourly and also reimbursed for her mileage. I generally only jump on the lunch train with other people and order from the same place so that she doesn’t have to drive somewhere specifically for my food. The only exception to this is Starbucks. When there’s the BOGO after 3 deal, I will order something and then offer her the free drink for making the drive. I’ve done this 3 or so times now and have always given her the free drink. Last week, I was talking with another coworker who apparently had no idea this offer sometimes exists.

2012,"WIBTA For forcing my hyphotetical future child(ren) to have a hobby? Okay, I am aware this sounds weird and silly but hear me out.

I, (23F) like probably many other young people have thought about having kids in the future and what the life would be like then. My boyfriend (22M) and I like to play out these funny scenarios what we would do with our kids and just think how our kids would turn out. 

I wasn't never really able to have any hobbies, I only used to draw with old pens on my spare time and now it is really bugging me off. We used to live a bit further away from the city where all the activities were. My mom would always say that my hobbies are mine and not hers, meaning that she would not drive me to city, so I was never able to have a hobby. 

My boyfriend on the other hand was able to try out whatever he wanted, and his parents would support him which is exactly what I would have wanted for my parents to do when I was a kid. 

One day we had a conversation about our hobbies and my bf was explaining how he wished how his parents would have pushed him a bit more towards one hobby, instead of allowing him to change a hobby when he felt like he was challenged. I on the other hand was just hoping that I could have gotten some support and my parents allowing me to have a hobby, especially since they now joke about me being completely talentless. 

We laughed and agreed that in the future, our (hyphotetical) children will be able to have any hobby they want but we will also support and ""force"" them to follow through if the hobby gets challenging. Obviously if the hobby becomes too stressful or unbearable we allow them to change it, but we would want them to do something so they won't end up regretting having no hobbies as a kid in the future. 

And now to the WIBTA part: 

I met up with a friend (24F) a couple of days ago, and as we were chatting I mentioned the previous conversation we had with my boyfriend. 

 I thought I would have a fun reaction to why I am thinking about such things  but instead it lead to a horrible rage, to my friend saying I am not allowed to force people  or choose how my kids live their youth. 
She said that I would be a horrible mom for forcing my kids to go through some annoying hobby and said that she hopes I will never have any kids. 

I kinda just froze and laughed it off saying that ""Well, I don't have to think about having kids for a couple of years anyways..! "" 

Things got pretty awkward and we both just quietly decided to end the evening and I left. 

It's been a couple of days and the comments she made haven't left my mind. I felt quite bad for what she said, and would I really be an asshole for doing that?","YTA if you literally force a kid to engage in a hobby they don't like. I think it's one thing to talk to the kid and encourage them to push through a tough spot so they learn not to simply give up when something is challenging.

As a hypothetical, if your kid expresses an interest in learning piano, tries it for a few months, and then decides they don't like it, you shouldn't force them to continue. It might be reasonable to insist they keep trying *for a short time* just to be sure.

Would you really force your child to engage in a hobby for years, potentially their entire childhood, because they decided to try it when they were eight years old?

Perhaps your friend and I are misinterpreting you and perceiving your stance as more extreme than it really is, but that's how you're coming across. It sounds like you're swinging the pendulum way too far in the other direction after your own experience of having no support from parents.",1,YTA,0.0,1.0,0

2016,"AITA For stopping my mom from looking at other people? My mom is a very curious person and I like her for that. She is the one who pushes me to explore more. However, I think sometimes she is a little bit too curious. 
Example of the situations where I tell her to stop looking:

1. There is a fight breaking out. My mom will stop not too far and will look how it turns out.
2. A crazy person on the train is screaming and shouting. She will look at him/her.
3. Police are arresting someone/stoping someone’s car. My mom will again stop to see what’s going on. 
4. People shouting at each other.

Basically, I feel like in those types of situations, it’s inappropriate to look, so I tell her to stop and keep going. Sometimes she agrees and stops, but sometimes she gets angry that I try to control her. I just feel like if I was being arrested, or if I was fighting with someone on the street, I wouldn’t want to have people stop around me and take their time looking.

2023,"AITA because my dog jumped at a cyclist and made them fall? So let's start with a little bit of backstory, and general information. Me and my dog are lucky enough to live next to a paved trail, the trail spans several miles, and is about 10-12ft wide. Everyday me and my dog (I'll call her Honey for this post) go for a walk on this trail. Honey is 11 months old at this point, and we adopted her when she was 9 months old. She didn't get much, if any, training before we got her from the shelter, so I am still breaking her of some bad habits. Honey is a 40lb hound dog, and I'm not exactly sure of her breed but on her hind legs she stands at about 4.5ft tall, and she is all legs.

Everyday I walk Honey on this trail, and we pass by about a dozen cyclists, and most of the time she doesn't pay them any mind. When I see a cyclist or a jogger approach I move myself and Honey onto the grass beside the path, so that even if she gets excited and tries to excitedly greet the passerby (which she does sometimes, especially if the person passing is talking to her or paying a lot of attention to her) I move into the grass far enough that even at the end of her 3ft leash she can't reach the path or get within a foot of it. I should also note that she never barks at a passerby unless they have a dog that barks first.

Now that you have a good understanding of Honey, the path, and how I handle her, I'll explain the situation.

Me and honey were walking down the path when out of nowhere a cyclist runs past us, and drives less than a foot away from Honey. I didn't hear him coming, and he didn't signal me, so I was startled and jumped back a bit towards the grass, and Honey was excited to see a new person, and jumped toward the cyclist. Honey didn't touch the cyclist, but came pretty close to him. About a foot and a half. This startled the cyclist, who lost his balance and spent about 15 seconds wobbling back and forth on his bike before he slowed down and rolled off his bike. At first I thought he was joking around, since he spent so long being wobbly and the fall looked so strange.

After he fell a ran up to him and asked if he was okay, he didn't respond. Honey was confused and was getting wild, so I tied her leash to a tree about 20 foot away from the gentleman that fell. I stayed near the man until he drove off. The man spent about 5 minutes rubbing his wrist and walking up and down the path angrily, I asked if he was okay, and if I could help him. He didn't respond and didn't say anything to me other than saying ""you need to control your fucking dog"" to which I replied ""well I moved once I saw you, but you didn't signal me and I didn't notice you until you were past me""

He didn't respond to that, he continued as he was before examining his bike, and once decided it wasn't damaged he rode off.

So my question is, AITA? Is my dog too out of control to take on this path? Or is it the cyclists problem, since he snuck up on me and my dog?

EDIT: I guess I didn't make this clear in the post. When I say he slowed down before falling off the bike, I mean he slowed way down. He was going slow enough before he fell that I could have past him at a brisk walk.

EDIT 2: I should have made this more clear in the post, but the cyclist came from behind me and had one of those bikes with the thin wheels.","This may be an unpopular opinion, but YTA. The dog is your responsibility, and the dog knocked over a cyclist driving on a public path. Yeah, the cyclist could have signalled you, but your dog is not his responsibility.  He doesn't know that your dog is reactive (I always called this 'agressively Happy' like, the dog just wants to greet, but can be a little too jumpy/barky). You need to be more aware of your surroundings when you're walking the dog. Maybe you might consider walking off the path a bit, with yourself in between the dog and the path, until the dog chills out a bit around new people/dogs/bikes. Training is a process, and while I don't think you purposely did anything wrong, it's up to you to keep your dog from knocking cyclists over.",1,YTA,0.0,1.0,1

2026,"WIBTA - if I told my classmate to stop blowing his nose in class? There’s a guy in my class who is very unhygienic. He clearly doesn’t shower and rarely ever changes his clothing. I’ve seen his butt crack more times than my own at this point. His hands are so sticky you can see the finger prints after he touches paper and he smells like death. Like my dog after she has rolled in a dead bird.

He’s been sick the past two weeks but still goes to school. The entire row in front of his seat has been sick for a week now. May be a coincidence but whatever. He always blows his nose IN class. And it’s not like just a small, quiet blow to just remove a bit of liquid. It’s full on trumpet and you can hear every drop of slime leave his nose. It has us all gagging. In my country we eat lunch in the same classroom.

Last Friday I saw snot fall from his nose, into his lap after he blew it. Half of the class turned their face away from him and visibly gagged.

He doesn’t have any friends in this class because of the things I described and he makes everyone uncomfortable with the things he says. So there’s really no one to tell him to stop.

One day during lunch he blew his nose right in front of me, and my entire group of friends gagged. I got up, said loudly “it’s honestly so damn disgusting and rude that anyone would blow their nose IN class.” And then I walked out. This was probably a dick move but I didn’t want to ‘confront’ him or for him to feel like I did.

Update: 
I want to add that I don’t expect him to stay home if he feels well enough to go to school. I’m talking about blowing his nose and coughing out into the open instead of into his arm etc.

2027,"AITA for being rude to a sex worker who interrupted a discussion about sex work? My girlfriend and I attended a munch a few weeks ago. For those who don't know, a ""munch"" is a meeting of sorts for kinky people that is organized via a popular website. People attend these meetings to find others with similar lifestyles, learn about techniques and concepts, talk about their interests and maybe even find relationships/play partners.

Anyway, I was talking with a guy there and we discovered we both have a common kink so he told me that he occasionally buys custom-made porn or pics from models. I half-jokingly told him that doesn't make much sense to me and that I could never do that. I would instead rather scour the internet for weeks to find something I liked than give in and pay someone, cause that's how I generally live my life. I try to look for bargains instead of paying full price for non-essential stuff, especially if I can find them for free if I look harder. He got my point and we had a bit of a laugh about it.

Unfortunately, a woman seating nearby overheard us and came over to tell me that she is a seller and that my views are ""sex-negative"" and ""toxic"" and that I shouldn't share them with others cause they actively hurt sex workers and their livelihood. I responded that this is not my problem and we had a bit of an argument.

We've been waiting for the warm up band to start for about 30 minutes when I notice that there's a rather large space completely empty to the left of it. It probably could fit around 5-6 people, so I grab my friend and go there to get a bit more space.

So, I (M20) have been working as a legal assistant at this really important law firm where I live for almost 6 months. Some of our clients are quite big and we usually work with companies and corporations rather than with natural persons or individuals. One of our clients is this huge company that sells construction materials, from steel to windows and everything related.

&#x200B;

A few months ago, this client told us that they needed to collect around 80.000 dollars from a contract they signed with this man who seemingly wanted to start some sort of business but it just fell apart. This is a moderately big amount of money where I live (to give you an idea, the basic salary is less than 400 dollars). Now, I don't know how the legal system works elsewhere, but in my country before you get to the audience, you need the sued person to get a notification (Google says it is called a subpoena). The thing is, he was almost impossible to be found. As his business failed, the address he gave when he signed the contract was useless and his ex wife wouldn't answer any emails from a law firm.

&#x200B;

In the midst of all this, we found on his Facebook that he had a daughter roughly my age. My boss basically told me to get his address from her, and that's what I did. I contacted her on Instagram once I knew her name, flirted with her for about a week and after some time being nice I told her I had some free time and that if she gave me her location on Whatsapp I could pick her up from her dad's and go for an ice cream or something. Once she agreed and sent me her address and some details so I could find her house I just blocked her everywhere and gave my boss the address he wanted.

On Friday afternoon, my boss asked me if I was able to take care of an extra project that same Saturday at the office. It was going to be overtime and significant extra earnings for only a couple hours.  It's a business casual office.

I talked to GF later on Friday and told her I wanted to take advantage of the offer, but I felt guilty about our plans. I asked if she would be up for coming into my office with me to hang out while i worked, 2hrs tops, and then have our Saturday.  

She was reluctant at first, she just wanted to relax, but I told her I was so into the idea of having her at the office with me, I would openly bribe her with a $150 Ikea gift card that I've had lying around (she has previously asked if I could ""donate"" it as she is redoing her living room (live separately).  She immediately agrees on the additional condition of a morning coffee as well. I'm totally fine with the stipulation. I told her to rest up and I would pick her up in the morning.

I left Saturday to pick her up and texted my boss I was headed in to the office shortly (there's an alarm thing so I thought it appropriate to give a heads up) my boss wrote back thank you and that they were going to stop in as well to pick up some files.

WIBTA if I spoke to her dentist about getting another assistant behind my GFs back?  Would this be considered betrayal if I'm looking out for her own good?

Please give your opinion because I am torn - because I care about her well being

EDIT: Thanks everybody, you guys helped put this into perspective that I'm overstepping and I guess good intentions but it's just not a good idea overall.  Y'all helped out.  Now it's just trying to support her through this shit she's going thru...

EDIT 2: I guess I should provide more context because many of the replies seem to lack context IMO...

My GF has been working at that office for about 10 months now / it's not ""unfamiliar"" anymore to her anymore in terms of the day-to-day task at hand.

She was offered by her dentist (who is a Mrs.) to hire another assistant because they have a very close work friendship.  We watch the dentist's dog, take him on walks, it's not as ""professional"" imo.  We're all friends, we hang out - which is why I thought it ***MIGHT*** be ok to talk to her dentist since I know her on a personal level.  

The fact of the matter is - her dentist offered to hire another assistant and she said no which is fine, she wants to toughen it out, I get that.  But what's not cool to me is: she cries herself to sleep, all she talks to me about is complaining about work and being tired and how she wishes there was somebody else to help her.  This just kinda puts me in a weird situation because I feel almost obligated to step in and give my 2 cents because it seems she's not willing to get help?

We have always been very close and keep no secrets from each other. I went to study abroad in China for almost half a year. My stomach couldn’t handle the local food too well so I thought it was a good time to diet and lose a few unnecessary pounds.

2044,"AITA- Am I the Asshole for Emailing My Teacher Asking About Last-Minute Grade Adjustments? Strap in, it’s a long one.

Ok, first some background for the teachers out there who might think this sounds ridiculous. 
This professor (let’s call her B) is a known NIGHTMARE. I have been in her class for only a semester (with another to come) and I’ve been through hell and back trying to stay on her good side.
For the sake of length, I’ll refrain from telling the other litany of stories I have. But as I tell my piece, keep in mind that upon reporting her to admin I was informed that there are countless other reports being sent in about her.

So, cue me. I love learning, I tend to be an attentive student, generally interested in my classes, and always trying to stay on the right side of my teachers. I’m not disruptive, disrespectful, and I mind the rules of all my teachers, regardless of whether I like them or not. Above all, I prioritize maintaining a good relationship/track record with my teachers, meaning I would NEVER intentionally do anything to sabotage that relationship, least of all with a professor I respect so much.

Now, the end of the quarter is today (Tuesday) and grades are due this Friday. It was supposed to end last Wednesday, but due to inclement weather it was extended. I was resolving some grade discrepancies with teachers, clarifying my quarter grades with some teachers who hadn’t 

Mind you, SHE IS KNOWN TO TAKE LATE WORK. I know I am not entitled to it, but I figured it was better to ask than miss the opportunity.

The following exchange is our email correspondence, verbatim.


Me: I know how late these are, and I completely understand if you choose not to accept them. I'm sorry these are so late, some of them I did but never turned in and others I did and didn't scan to turn them in. I know that I've been incredibly irresponsible this quarter when it came to turning in work, and I don't believe any excuse can justify it. My parents are ultra-strict, and I'm only emailing you in the last hope that I can have at least a B this quarter. I don't expect you to adjust my (name of college) grade, but it is incredibly important to me that I don't bring home a C this quarter. I'd be happy to talk to you about it in class tomorrow. 


B: I am sorry but grades went in already.


***Okay, pause. This sent off serious alarm bells in my head. If grades are closed already, then all my other grade discrepancies are too late to be resolved. Cue panic mode. I knew the quarter had been extended, but were teachers still closing their grading books at the usual date? No, they weren’t. This was her convoluted way of telling me “no, I’m not going to help you, it’s too late.” I misunderstood. Cue the message that sets her off, which again, had no intention of disrespect.


Me: How is that possible? I was under the impression that the quarter was extended until today.


B fires back minutes later, addressing me by my last name.
B: _______, I will be speaking with you today. I do not appreciate your tone. Expect to hear from your administrator as well.


Wow, that escalated quickly. I had no idea why she was so angry. Immediately I retracted my statement. 


Me: I apologize, I truly did not mean any disrespect.


B: You are panicking for something you did to yourself - please do not take it out on me. 


This confused me even more. Why continue instigating when I already apologized? I take responsibility for not doing the assignments and understand her saying she would not change the grades. It’s my bad, and I expressed as much. But I had never before been spoken to by a teacher this way. Take it out on her? I was confused, and upset. I was stressed about facing academic consequences, but now I also had to worry about receiving one of her 20 minute solo scream-sessions in class. I couldn’t handle that. I continued to retract my statement. 


Me: I completely understand. I apologize for bringing it up.


B: It was not you bringing it up - it was your reaction when I told you no.


But that’s just it, she hadn’t told me no. She could’ve stated it that way and I would’ve understood, but she didn’t. I was upset at being reprimanded for a misunderstanding that seemed unavoidable. I had done so much to keep a good track record with her. I had hoped that our good relationship would help her understand the extreme stress and academic pressure I was feeling at home, but I also understood that I wasn’t entitled to it. I’ve considered emailing her again and apologizing further, but talking to her now feels like a minefield. AITA?


To clarify, this is a high school course. It is dual-enrolled through my local community college, and the students who choose to take such courses typically care about their learning and are dedicated to academic success. We’re not derelicts, as she so often treats us. We’re not college students, or adults who should know better. We’re kids. I’m a kid, and I care about respecting authority and maintaining academic integrity and success. I feel truly devastated by this, as I have never been talked to by a teacher this way. 

I’m genuinely curious to know what you guys think on this, because I’m open to the idea that I’m in the wrong. I’m trying to see it from her side, what do you guys think? AITA?

The fact is, I would’ve completely understood if she had said no. It upset me that she threatened administrative action over a small misunderstanding when I’ve thus far proved to be a responsible and rule abiding student. I know it wasn’t a great thing to ask, but if I hadn’t asked at all I had no chance of success. Maybe I shot myself in the leg, put my foot in my mouth. Sorry for the long one guys.

So I play a lot of Rocket League- it's a fun game.  But it's also very competitive.  If you lose too often you rank down; if you win often you rank up.

In Rocket League, I'll often play 1v1s and 2v2s where if 1 player loses connection for a round or sees their ping go up above 150 ms, the game is basically unplayable.  In these games, the team to which this occurs suffers, particularly in 1v1.

To clarify, I have done everything in my power to try to keep a stable connection.  I have an ethernet cable to my router on broadband internet, and still I will occasionally experience ping greater than 500 ms and occasionally disconnect from games, leaving my teammates in a 1v2 situation for about 1 minute.

So eventually when my connection returns, I'll ask that the opposing teammates return the goals they illegitimately earned, as many games come down to 1 or 2 point leads.

More often than not, the opposing team refuses to give the goals back, saying ""It's competitive.  I need to rank up.""  And I'll respond with ""It's competitive.  I need to rank up.""

I entered a drawing for a show a couple of weeks ago, and I found out this afternoon that I won two tickets. The tickets are worth about $30-50 and are in a city about a 45-minute drive away.  I asked a friend if she wanted to go with me, and she said yes, even though she'd never heard of the people performing.  I then asked if she would mind driving, since I've already driven a lot today and I was giving her a free ticket.

2051,"AITA For telling new friends my wife's parents are second cousins? My wife and I were having dinner at her sister's house. One of her good friend's was there, her friend brought another couple to join us as well (six people). We have met the couple once before at a party and ended up talking to them for several hours (they aren't strangers).

During dinner, 23AndMe came up. We had done the whole family (wife+sister+kids+in-laws) and recently received our results.

We chatted about several random things during this conversation :

* My kids are in fact mine (not that there was ever a debate but we like to joke)
* How it says my wife is a morning person (she's not).
* How a friend of my wife's found out that her father was not who she thought.
* The couple brought up how someone they new who was a sperm donor child found out about 10+ siblings.

I say at least they didn't find out they were married to a sibling. We talked about how it auto-predicts your relationship to one another (mom/dad/sibling/cousins). Examples like how her sister showed up as her sister. I then mention that her parents were second cousins and it showed up too. My wife and her sister talk about how they knew at an early age that their parents were second cousins, and how their parents had randomly brought it up by talking about how they shared relatives with one another.

Topic moves on to other stuff and we hang out for another hour or two. Amazing credit to me wife for being pissed but not showing it but you can imagine my surprise when we get in the car to go home and she rages at me. We argue about it a bit but it doesn't seem like we are getting anywhere. My wife is slightly drunk, not enough that she will have a hangover the next day, but enough that I don't think fighting about it going to be productive. I say sorry but I think you are being unreasonable, I don't want to discuss it more right now. It's late past our bedtime and we have to wake up early to deal with kids. We go to bed with her mad at me.

No surprise that she is pissed at me in the morning and is not talking to me today.

My wife thinks I should have known that this is a private thing that you would never tell people. I say I'm sorry, but that I disagree that I should have known. My reasoning :

* Somewhat frowned upon second cousins is legal in every state. I'm under the impression it's even more common outside of the united states.
* We are open people, nothing has been off the table before this incident. (politics, religion, elitism, racism, what porn we watch, taking it up the butt, how often we have sex, who we love/hate, think is hot/not, etc).
* We had talked about her parents being second cousins several times before. Never was I given any indication that it was a topic that should be kept secret.

Many use me as their confidant and tell me about their issues with one another and then return to our social gatherings as if nothing is wrong. After a while the unrest and infighting has grown to the point where we often don't see certain members of our circle as they need time to recover from associating with someone else.

When they had an issue with me, they made it public that they had an issue with me. I addressed their issues with me and adjusted how I carry myself so that they no longer have said issues. It has lead to them liking me more than how they like one another and some confiding in me.

6 years later, I have had enough of the infighting and made public to all of them the info they provided to me in a large diatribe calling each of them out on their bullshit. To which point all of them, including the confidants, did the equivalent of ""fuck you. You don't know me"" and blocked me.

So far, only one person, the friend I have known for the longest, has unblocked me apologizing for their reaction and they want to remain friends. They also want to rebuild the circle starting with me and another person we both trust.

Sam is from my 1st marriage, which ended with me being single and homeless living with family. I got no help from my ex (still don't). I was on assistance for a small time, but living with sketchy family on welfare wasn't a good life for Sam. I made the choice to  drop out of school and work to making a better living short term. I had enough units to teach preschool, so I found a job that paid enough for us to get off public assistance, got a 1 bedroom and babysat overnight to give Sam a living with no gunshots. I met my (now) husband 4 years later.

&#x200B;

10 years later he's now my husband and we also have a 4 year old, Dan. My husband is the best man you'd ever meet. He's loved Sam as his own since they met. He's taken care of us, supported us, encouraged Sam's bio dad to better his life-not to mention that he keeps a better house then I ever could alone. Basically he's the perfect guy.

&#x200B;

2 years ago we decided together that I should finish school. I'd have more earning power and it's always been my dream to teach. So that's what we did. I chose a school where I can take classes remotely (I still worked too) and he picked up more hours at work. He's worked in retail his whole life-sometimes working 14 hour shifts all so I could finish school while us having minimal student loan  debt. Well I'm done and graduation is in June. My husband wants to pursue his dream-school part time while being a stay-at-home dad. I was offered a job  that makes more then both of us combined, but it's a bit far so we will have to relocate.  Financially we can do it, but we can't afford to do that and attend my graduation. (It's in an expensive city across the state)

Of course I insisted that we pick moving. I shrugged off walking in my graduation because my husband sees that as MORE IMPORTANT then him being able to pursue his dream right away. We're officially moving and I'm so happy for this.

But my husband's youngest cousin is also graduating with her credential from (a different) school. She's going to be a teacher as well and her family is having a big party to celebrate. They live 2 hours from here. His whole family will be there and he has not seen them in a while. I do not want to go.

I'm jealous. We worked so hard to get what we have and walking was a part of my dream. I was devastated when I stopped school and I never thought I'd have a chance to make it right. I don't want to celebrate someone else's success knowing I couldn't celebrate my own.

I'm insisting that we don't go but I'm getting the feeling from my husband that his family thinks I'm the asshole. He's supportive, but I'm not sure if I'm being petty.

To give some backstory, when she was in elementary she was the kind child anyone could have known. She always thought to put people before her and overall had a calm temperament. Then she started puberty at around middle school. When she started puberty she turned into an angry, aggressive person. She'd always complain and get extremely angry. She even had issues with harming herself by pulling her hair and scratching her arm. She also began holding grudges from the past, and I do believe it would be caused by her abusive teachers in preschool and a bully she had never told me about until 4th grade (thus we could not have taken action). We did think she had a problem in the beginning, so we treated her with lots of love. During middle school, she had earned an invitation to join a counseling group for girls, and despite us pushing her to go she decided not to go. Over time our daughter grew more and more calm, stopped harming herself, and has become more like herself back when she was young. So I thought it would have been hormones during her puberty years, but this year she asked me to send her to therapy. Now I have thought about it, and I believed she wouldn't require therapy. It was probably the flaring hormones while she was developing, and she has become much more adjusted to become a normal girl. Therapy is extremely expensive around here as well, and we have never mistreated or abused her.

Anyway, I found a kit for about 15$ (not actual currency but converts for ease) but upon buying it, they will slap a 7$ delivery fee ontop which makes the prices far above what I hoped. 

However, the site has a policy that states that if you order above 50$, you don't need to pay the delivery fee.

What I am concidering is ordering both the bleeding kit and like a pair of shoes to avoid the fee and then return the shoes which means I don't actually have to pay the fee.

I know this works because I needed to return a cycling shirt because in Poland, people there are apparantly really small, and even though my order now came under 50$ through the return, I never got an invoice for the delivery fee. 

Returns are also free by company policy.

So, WIBTA?

Edit: Grammer and clarification","YTA - If you are doing this off the bat, it is dishonest and manipulative of a deal that the website is promoting. Also, if you have shoes shipped to you and you return them, there will be an environmental impact as well as a restocking chore for someone at the company.

2068,"AITA for telling my friend to get over a crush that rejected him and he’s not actually depressed? Hello! This is my very first post on Reddit, so sorry for my misspellings and typos.
So a bit of context I’ve been best friends with this dude since 3rd grade, let’s call him “George”.
and he’s had a crush on a friend of another friend of mine since middle school, we’re now seniors in high school.
A couple weeks ago he confessed to his crush we’ll call her “Lisa” and from what I’ve heard from George it probably didn’t go well, Lisa basically told him she had to think about it and talk with her friends about it.
Turns out Lisa knew the whole time he liked her but didn’t want to say anything.
So George has been going up to me saying he’s sad and scared that she’ll reject him, which is understandable a lot of people go through that (well not me cause I look a potato), so I let him talk to me and vent.
Then three weeks ago George told me that Lisa rejected her and he kept whining about how much he loved and missed, saying “He’ll never get over Lisa” and saying that he was “Depressed”.
I may have sounded a bit harsh when I had a talk with him, but it’s because I’ve been through some worse shit when I was a kid.
So I looked at George and told him “George, being sad for a little bit is not being “depressed”, I would know because my other friend had depression. And also just get over it! It’s just one girl in your life, soon it won’t even matter!”.
And after some stern talking he just stayed quiet, from my perspective he seemed really upset, and I think mad at me.
AITA for telling my friend this?","YTA

2072,"AITA for telling me sister IDGAF about what’s happening overseas when she was talking about the Hong Kong protests at her birthday? My sister is a very outspoken and intelligent person. She loves nothing more than a good discussion and at family get togethers she’ll frequently turn the conversation political or control the conversation to either make others feel bad (eg. Calling out republican voting family etc) or to try and ‘educate’ people into supporting her flavor of wokeness. 

It was her birthday party last night and my mom threw a small party to celebrate. She invited family over and we just had close fam there. 

My sister at dinner that my mom had spent hours preparing decided to leap into conversation about what’s happening to Muslims in China and Burma, and also the protests in south east Asia (Hong Kong maybe?) she directed this conversation to the table at large and really went in on how we are just passive bystanders, how children are dying, etc. And went into detail about suffering that people are facing. 

The whole time she was saying this she was directly staring at me because I frequently tell her that it’s not a conversation I want to hear, my mental health isn’t great tbh and I’m already brain deep in miserable thoughts. I know we can’t control the shit happening outside the world but I’m seriously burned out from all the shit going on and I don’t think it’s appropriate to ALWAYS be angrily doom and gloom. 

When other family members began to slowly stop eating, shift and look uncomfortable, she carried on. Finally my uncle told her to leave off and my mom asked her to just enjoy dinner. She carried on. 

Eventually I just blew up and told her no one gives a shit about what’s going on outside the world, half of us are fucking stressed about what’s happening in the US for crying out loud and compassion fatigue is a real thing. 

She responded by literally screeching that I’ve ruined her birthday, that I’m a heartless ass, etc. I feel very very guilty, moreso because my uncle slipped me $20 to buy myself some beer when the night was done and he and her have famously never got along so I feel bad that he took enjoyment from it.","YTA, wow.

  This week mid day (11am-4pm) I'm watching a YouTube video and hear a loud pounding noise coming from the other side of the wall, my roommates room. I immediately lower the volume because I never had the intention of waking him up. He then send me a message that he's not mad just being assertive since I seem to forget that he needs to sleep.

After a few messages back I state that I would be willing to move my computer as I think the issue is how close it is to his wall. My volume was not loud on my computer to begin with.

Relevent info: This past week my stepdaughter and her friend went to Disneyland with stepdaughters mother and husband for 8th grade promotion gift, we also got her tickets to Petcon (yes, it is what you think it is) since both girls have Instagram pages for their beloved dogs. We cleared the petcon tickets with her mother in the middle of May just to be sure it wasn't conflicting with their Disney trip, we were told that it was perfect timing and that her and her husband with have a date day to enjoy Disney alone doing what they wanted instead of what the kids wanted.



While at Petcon (Saturday) the hubs asked if I would be ok with going to Universal Studios on Sunday, I have a funky growth on my foot that is very very painful if I'm on my feet & not wearing a pair of uggs, I told him I'll be fine, I have painkillers! But ask her mom if it is ok before you bring it up to kiddo cause this is their vacation. He asked but also invited them to go with us, we all get along so it isn't something that would be out of character. At first it was no big deal cause they were just driving home on Sunday we told her we'd of course pay for kiddo & kiddo friend since this was our idea. Then all of a sudden 2 hrs later it became an issue, she has to to x y z on Monday, she can't afford kiddos friend (we had at this point bought all 4 tickets) she has expensive stuff that can't be left in the car etc... 




According to her, we ruined her whole vacation, we made her cry at Disneyland (ya know the day she was spending it alone with her husband? We brought the kids back sooner so they could go to Disney at night with them) we make things so difficult for her, we never think of her feelings and she is always the low man on the totem pole, etc... 




Also as a side note: since all day Saturday was ""our day"" we had planned to take them to Midevil  Times for dinner but her mom said they'd rather come back and go to Disney with them. Come to find out from kiddo, her mom never asked if they wanted to go.

2081,"AITA for accidentally saying there aren’t many women in engineering? This happened a few days ago. I’m in college and I went to some computer/hacking club callout. I sat beside this girl and we were making small talk, like “how are you”, “how’s school so far”, “what classes u taking” etc etc.

After a bit she goes “Ugh why are there so many men here? There’s only like 3 other women”

And I went “obviously”

And she goes “what do you mean by obviously?!?!” And she says it super loud and everyone just stops talking and looks back at us. 

And I straight up look at her, then turn to the guy on the other side of me and start talking to him, pretty much ignoring her while I could feel her glaring at me. After it kinda quieted down, she started talking to me again and demanding I apologize. I refused to apologize and told her that statistically, there are less women in engineering/CS.

I told my friends afterwards and they said I should’ve just apologized, but I felt like I didn’t need to as I gave an explanation for why I said obviously. I wasn’t sexist, I was just stating facts.

We were recently seated at the same table for a work related dinner event in which families were invited. He brought his wife and his adult daughter and son, and I brought my husband. I have occasionally met his daughter a few times when she was a teenager, and she always struck me as a big daddy's girl. Now she is 21, and since she was seated next to her father all night, I got a glimpse at how weirdly affectionate they are together. 

They would giggle and take goofy selfies, she would give him repeated kisses on the cheek and would tease him about it leaving a lipstick mark, she would link arms with him and snuggle into his neck, they held hands, and they shared a single dessert and ate off each other's plates. And she had no issues with finishing multiple glasses of wine in front of him. It was so weird, the whole night. The whole family was there but it was like the two of them were sharing every inside joke, just them. I could understand if she was a little kid, but she's an actual adult. 

As we were leaving a couple of us from our table were having a smoke and I joked ""Do you think [colleague] is going to bed with his daughter or his wife tonight?"" When they gave me a weird look like they didn't get it, I said that there was clearly something weird there but they told me to drop it. 

Back in the office a couple people have chastised me for starting ""malicious rumours"", but it really was just a joke.

2085,"AITA for expecting a bite of my boyfriend's burrito? Get ready for a petty AITA with my boyfriend. We are otherwise happy and I love his stupid ass. So I (24F) was staying over at my boyfriend’s (24M) place and I made it very clear to him that I was pretty hungry. For background I am a big sharer - I always buy him stuff when I pick up or make food. I also go out of my way to save the remainder of any food I eat for him even though I’d be down to eat it later.

Anyways, before I agreed earlier in the day to drive over around 8 pm, I made it very apparent that I hadn't eaten since 11 am and was very hungry/needed to eat. When I got there we hung out for a little, after which he proceeded to heat up half of his leftover burrito (and didn’t say anything addressing my hunger, or even his for that matter). He then started GOING TO TOWN on the burrito and I was a little hangry-induced peeved.

With two bites left he half heartedly offered me a bite (he admitted later it was indeed a half hearted offer). I said no I’m good due to the reason above. He proceeded to take it down in well under a minute. We sat around for at least 2 minutes after the burrito demolition while I was still noticeably peeved. After noticing my non-characteristic annoyance he offers to make me some freezer tacos. I accepted them somewhat begrudgingly and got in a better mood once I was full and forgot about it. This good mood lasted for a while until yesterday when he brought it up two months later.

This came up randomly on a flight yesterday when I was hangry. His argument is that it’s his burrito and he can do whatever he wants with it. My argument is that even though he knew I was super hungry, he chose to eat his precious burrito in front of me when he could've easily A) made food/communicated that he would make food for at the same time or B) genuinely offered me a bite of burrito before actually feeding me. We are both sticking to our guns. This isn’t super consequential, but I am such a AITA lurker and would love to get opinions, AITA?

I regularly have to call her phone to help her find it, or help her find her glasses, or shoes, or brush, or whatever else it is that she needs that really shouldn't go missing that often.


Anyways, I always have a certain spot to put my stuff. I want to make sure I always know where whatever I need is at so it has it's own space. A lot of the time though, I'll go to get it and it's missing. Whether it's my wallet, or the nail clippers, or the phone charger, whatever, it randomly goes missing.


Usually my wife tries to deny that she ever saw it, much less touched it, but a majority of the time when I find what I was looking for she'll go ""oooh that's right, I was using that the other day! I totally forgot!"". However, sometimes she'll keep insisting she never touched it, doesn't know how it got there, never even saw it before then, etc.


Well my nail clippers went missing and I got mad at her because damnit, I'm so tired of my stuff going missing! She kept insisting she never saw them or touched them and showed me her hands and said ""I don't even cut my nails!"" (She gets them done, but toenails maybe? Or maybe she was trying to cut something with them who knows.) She kept insisting it wasn't her. I found them in the living room near her seat, but she still said it wasn't her and if she did do her nails, it wouldn't be in the living room.

2092,"AITA for being disappointed with Christmas last year? My (18F) parents have always been champs at christmas but 2017 was the year I was officially an adult and my sister was out of the country for Christmas for the first time. I believed in Santa longer than the average child but when they knew that I knew he wasn’t real they still made an effort to make it seem like he was purely because that’s how it’s always been and how I like it.

I’m disappointed not only because they broke that tradition last year, but they didn’t seem to make any effort at all with gifts. Since my sister wasn’t there I did all the work and made Christmas menus and got them double the amount of presents despite being mentally ill and having a tough time.

Santa got them each a present but none for me. What they got me were pretty disappointing as well. For example, I got two dresses. I’d bought one like a week beforehand because I needed one but I never wear them unless I absolutely have too. They also got me a pair of sunglasses which make me look like a freaking alien. They know I always go for a certain style and that was definitely not it. They got me the game Battleship despite the fact I hate board games. I also wanted band merch and specifically told them which one I wanted but they got me a different one because they liked it more.

Idk I really try to enjoy my gifts and try new things. I played battleship but got bored, I’ve worn my dresses out and my sunglasses but have been EXTREMELY uncomfortable. I know they have good intentions but if I try to say they’re not me they get offended and call me ungrateful. 

Am I the asshole here for being disappointed with the break in tradition and shitty presents?



TL;DR: Struggling to enjoy my unusual Christmas presents and getting blamed when I hint towards not liking them","I don’t think you’re an asshole for feeling disappointed, but rather that your attitude about it makes you an asshole. You’re 18. You’re way too old to be upset that you didn’t get presents from Santa.

Sometimes gifts miss the mark and while that’s disappointing, gifts aren’t always going to be exactly what you asked for. For example, your comment about the band merch - you asked for something particular, and they got you something *they* wanted to get for you instead. They probably thought you’d like because it was similar, or maybe (as parents often do) they couldn’t remember the exact thing you wanted and thought they got it right.

Maybe they got you dresses because you rarely wear them and they thought you didn’t have many/any. Maybe they thought you’d want some more grown up clothes.

It may have been difficult for your parents to pick out gifts for you because like you said, you’re now an adult. Hence the sunglasses and board game.

Have you even considered that your parents might have found it difficult to have Christmas without your sister there? I know when my brother moved out of state to join the army, our first Christmas without him was pretty low key and kind of sad. Maybe that’s why your parents weren’t emotionally able to host Christmas in a way that was up to your standards.

Judging by your wording in your post, I can imagine the tone and phrasing you probably used when you told your parents you didn’t like your gifts, and I totally agree that you’re ungrateful. “They didn’t seem to make any effort at all with gifts”?

2093,"AITA for feeling like I don't need to apologize? One of my best friends has a new girlfriend of about 6 months. Before I met her, I was told that she had some chronic pain problems. I was unsure about how bad and even asked if walking around a lot (our double date required a lot of walking) was going to be OK. I was told sure, no problem. During the date, I’m being nice, trying to get to know her and all I could really get to know about her is her illness, she doesn’t work or go to school. Now, I also have a chronic illness, it’s in remission but nonetheless, I can relate and am aware that some illnesses are invisible. However, it did put me off a little that as soon as I introduced myself, she went right into talking about her illness. This made me feel a certain way for many reasons, mainly that I was afraid that she might hinder my friend’s goals as well as him taking on a caretaker role. Before he met her, he had plans to start a clothing line and seemed excited about it. Few weeks after the date, just me and my friend are hanging out, and I told him that while she seemed nice, I was concerned about some things, mainly that she didn’t work or go to school and that may interfere with his plans/life. I am admittedly a skeptical person and can be distrusting, and everything I was seeing, and hearing was contradictory, so I did mention that it seemed odd that she was drinking (despite being on many medications) and that she was fine to walk around for a few hours. Another example, I was told their sex life is fine and they have no issues with it, she has no pain during. Then I talked more about how I was concerned that she did not work or go to school and if there were plans for that, even suggesting online school or maybe part time desk work. I also expressed concern about him taking on such a big responsibility of essentially a caretaker and that it may hinder his clothing line goals and other things in his life (for example, he complained he was gaining weight now even though he’s always been big into working out). He was very appreciative and grateful for watching out for him and basically praised me for being a great friend. Flash forward to present, I find out that my friend told his girlfriend what I said, taking it out of context and saying I said she was faking her illness and that I did not believe her – not mentioning anything else I said. He also said he doesn’t need my concern, he’s a grown man. He was also upset that “why would I even question her because sometimes she can’t even walk up the stairs.” Now he’s upset he’s the middle man and thinks me and her need to talk about it. I asked him if he could connect us again so I could explain and apologize. Thinking it over though, I feel like I don’t owe an apology because he shouldn’t have told her those things to cause this rift between us. Also, I didn’t even say the things he says I said, so I wouldn’t even know what I would be apologizing for. AITA? Should I actually apologize?

Last week, my sister and I had planned on going on a Disney vacation and discussed splitting the costs. I assumed it was my sister, myself, and my two nieces (his step daughters) since she didn't mention him and how the cost was being split between my sister and I equally. Fast forward to today and she stated the 5 of us would be getting Disney shirts made for our trip. I asked her why would we need 5 shirts and she stated her husband would be going too. 

I later texted her and told that he's her husband and I respect that but I honestly don't want to go on a vacation with him after what he did to her. She got upset at me and told me what does that have to do with me. She brought up a guy I had been seeing and how he hurt me and she would still have come hang with us because she's my sister and she loves me despite this person hurting me. I told her I would always be cordial to her husband and I don't mind going to a dinner or what not but I don't want to spend 5 days with this person and share a hotel room.

She said she was going to try and make her marriage work, and if you want to support her, then support her in her effort to make the marriage work.

2106,"WIBTA for refusing to allow the ""driver"" of my elderly relatives to attend the wedding. Scenario: a very small wedding (think 45 people)Issue: my aunty and uncle can't drive anymore due to age, and they need someone to drive them from out of town. They want this friend of theirs who is driving to attend the wedding as well, because ""what else is she going to do? She doesn't know anybody in the city, and would like to see the wedding!""

Mitigating factor: this driver is not totally unknown to me, because she cuts lawns in my hometown and I have met her that way, at different relative's houses. I like her but she is pretty much a stranger to me.

My take: I don't want my already-small wedding to have a basic stranger in attendance. We have already trimmed the guest list pretty tightly. I feel it is a wedding thus only our nearest and dearest should come. It is not a reunion, or a meet-and-greet, or a place for (essentially) a chauffeur to fill their night because they can't be arsed to chill in the hotel room or go figure out something else to do (my perspective!).However, my family does not see it in the same ""no brainer"" light. They think I am being a cheapskate, and exaggerating when I say she (the driver) is a comparative stranger, because she has been mowing lawns for years in our town, so they think I am putting on airs by not ""allowing"" her to attend.

My fiancée and I are paying for the wedding. We are both women by the way,   and on that note I don't feel comfortable with people I don't know whether they are accepting at the wedding. I feel a bit asshole-ish for putting my foot down.  But it seems like if their friend driving them can't attend, my aunty and uncle will beg off. And I really love them! They raised me for a year when I was a baby because my mom was ill.

Am I being a frigging ass at making this a thing??

Thanks for playing. Outsider's opinions is always enlightening. I can be in my head too much.","YTA

Unless you’re going to go out there and get them yourself, it seems like they have no other way to attend than this person giving them a ride. Not allowing the person to sit inside and eat is like telling your photographer they aren’t allowed to sit all night, drink anything you provide the guests or eat anything. This person is providing you a service and transporting valuable people. 

Is it really going to ruin your wedding to have one person there if you get to have your aunt and uncle? Is this person expected to drive them then sit in the car all night and wait? That’s pretty crappy. 

Either they have a ride or they don’t. You have to decide if you’re going to hire a professional driver, allow this person to come inside or accept these relatives can’t come at all.",1,YTA,0.0,,0
2107,"AITA for keeping animal remains in a shared freezer? I work part time as a specimen preparation technician for a small collection in a college biology department where I stuff, mount and process animal remains to be used as teaching and research tools. Whenever I find a dead animal that I can legally take I bring it in to work to prepare it as a specimen. Occasionally people will give me their pets / things they find to process. 

Recently someone gave me their dog to taxidermy, and after I had removed, stuffed and processed the skin I was left with the flesh and bones and had no use for them research wise, so I decided i wanted to process the bones and keep them for myself.

However my roommate is very upset with me having the remains in the freezer. The body is in 2 plastic bags and frozen solid. There are no internal organs, so it is kinda just a piece of meat and bones about the size of a large chicken. 

I understand that my work can be weird to other people, and try to minimize their exposure. My other roommates are alright with it, and I try to not keep animals in the freezer for more than a few days, however this dog was in there for closer to 10 days.

He voiced his concern outloud in a group of our friends and I felt embarrassed by it and kind of betrayed.

2114,"AITA for hating writing thank you notes? 


Be forewarned, this is technically both a hypothetical and recurring issue, and I'm on mobile.

So, with the holiday season coming up, here's a hopefully short moral issue for you all: I hate writing thank you notes. I'm a 20 year old in college, and every year my mom makes me write thank you notes to relatives who all give me money (which is what I request, not like they're declining to give a present). My problem is this, I hate writing them because they all seem unnecessary (and in some cases disingenuous). 

I still follow the typical formula of ""Dear X, thank you very much for [gift]. I appreciate it because [reason] and am looking forward to using it [insert whatever use if it's a practical gift]. I loved seeing you over the holiday, and look forward to seeing you at [next family gathering]. Love, Me."" I write up to 10 each year all at once which is kind of difficult for my arthritis/chronic pain, but mainly it just takes up time and is hard to customize for each family member because there are just so many of them and they all give the same thing.

Now that I'm mainly getting money that pays for mostly useless college textbooks and occasionally food, it seems kind of silly to write them. Not that I'm thankful, I am, and I am extremely grateful in person and show this in the form of hugs (which I don't really like) and verbal thank yous. If I get the gift by paypal or venmo, I often call the person to thank them and ask about what's going on in their life, just to pad out the call and not leave it as ""hey thx 4 the money bye lol see u in 6 months""

Am I the asshole for not really wanting to write them this upcoming season, since I feel like I've already shown it in a more real sense than the fake and kind of forced thank you notes I scribble out every year? 

(I tried to get out of it last year, but it didn't go very well so I just sucked it up and wrote them for the sake of not making my mom give me disapproving looks for the next week until I leave again.

How did this get started.....

We met her friend Kavita for lunch today. Kavita just got back from Toronto's carnival and was showing us some pictures. A few of them were her wearing basically a thong.

Now for those who don't know, Toronto carnival or Caribbean style carnivals are not like Brazil's carnival. Brazil is very very tame in comparison, yes the costumes are skimpy but it's a parade.

Caribbean carnivals start off pleasant enough but end up being a public 'orgy' of grinding and dry humping.

Now her friend is married but her husband didn't go with her and she's there telling my wife about how many guys she grinded with (dozens) and how sexy it all was.

Anyway, when we got home I causally mentioned to my wife, if I were Kavita's husband, I'd never even let her wear such a revealing costume in the first place. I said what she did was extremely inappropriate and that if she wanted to go without him she shouldn't have been wearing a thong.

My girlfriend immediately retorted saying she disagrees and that if she wanted to wear a thong in public without me, she can and doesn't need my permission.

I argued back saying, if she did then she'd be single. Thongs send the wrong message to other men. It's effectively like her going somewhere and advertising that she's single and looking to hook up.

She said, that's not at all and that my way of thinking is archaic and sexist. I said that's the reality of how people and guys think.

She told two of her friends and they both sided with her saying I'm way too controlling and insecure.

My argument is that wearing a thong without me present is basically her signalling to other men that she wants to be approached and even hook up because she's being sexually explicit with her own body.

It's not that I don't want to be with a girl who'd do this, it's the fact that she doesn't understand how men think and that women themselves will think she's a whore. If she were to wear a thong on a beach or carnival party without me, I'd have a really hard time believing she didn't do it with the intention of attracting male attention.

I only speak English, meaning I've never had a conversation with my grandparents that hasn't been translated for me. Sad I know, I have tried but I just have no affinity for learning languages beyond my first.

So on to my boyfriend... I have been dating my boyfriend for about 2 years now, he is my first boyfriend for all intents and purposes and so far everything has been going great. He is very respectful, hardworking and kind and has even managed to talk my parents round to liking him. Early last year I floated the idea of him coming to Malaysia with me for Chinese New Year in 2019 to meet my extended family, he was thrilled with the idea. We booked the trip around March or so.

Now here's the problem. My boyfriend has, without consulting me first, in the past 10 months gone behind my back and SECRETLY LEARNED HOW TO SPEAK CANTONESE(!!!!) to a conversational level. He then decided to spring this on me and my parents/siblings on New Years Eve as a ""surprise"". My family were very pleased, my Father spent almost the rest of the evening talking to him in Cantonese while my Mother gave me disparaging looks. I knew what was coming. I just felt sick, when we go to Malaysia he will be able to have full conversations with my own grandparents that I've never been able to enjoy while I'm sat alone again as the only single-language speaker in the room and my whole family is looking down on me and talking about me questioning me because if a white boy can do it why can't I?

I excused myself before midnight and went to bed, it isn't proper for him to be in my room alone because my family are very traditional so he didn't follow me but he did text me a few times to ask why I went to bed and if everything was okay which I ignored and quickly fell asleep.

Anyway, the next day my Mother asked if I had learned to speak Cantonese too, which I told her I hadn't, that he had gone and done this by himself and I still suck. Which started a huge shit storm basically how I have no respect and don't care about my family, how she's going to tell my grandparents to disinherit me, how I'm an embarrassment, how she's not going to let me go on the trip and so on.

By the afternoon my boyfriend had texted me quite a few times and was getting worried. I just replied asking if he knew what he did wrong and he was just even more confused. I explained it to him and he said that he just wouldn't speak it but it's too late! He will be the talk of the town before he even arrives and all of it will be held over me. I asked him why he didn't help me to learn with him, and he said that he knows I hate Cantonese and that it stresses me out because I'm bad at it and he just wanted to impress my family. I told him I needed space and he said OK, hasn't contacted me since (Which is a little suspicious...)

I also found of from him that he going to evening classes once a week on the day he told me he was out with his friends. Which also means he has been lying to me constantly (And more concerning, believably) for almost a year too.

So yeah. Is he the asshole to not only learn Cantonese, but then surprise me and my family with it without consulting me? Am I the asshole for feeling disgusted, angry and ashamed because of him?

Thanks

Tl;dr My boyfriend has learned my native language that I cannot speak behind my back and it's going to tear me apart from my family. AITA for having a problem with this?

2142,"AITA for semi-directly causing a very serious car accident? This is a throwaway account because I want to be totally honest about this. Partly to get it off my chest and partly because this sub needs more assholes and fewer validation stories.

This is a true story from a very long time ago that I've only shared with maybe 3 people in my real life. I was driving on a very long, straight highway for a very long time. There was pretty much nothing around; just 3 lanes going east, 3 lanes going west, a median in the middle, and then a ditch on the side. On the other side of the ditch was a slight incline upward.

I was cruising along at about 80 mph while the flow of traffic was closer to about 75. I was in the left lane, slowly passing the other cars and was not weaving in and out of lanes or anything. This was satisfactory for a long time. At some point though, a black SUV flew up behind me. He must have been going over 100 because he approached me very quickly. He got a little too close for comfort, and there was a car to my right so I couldn't get out of his way immediately.

The next part of the story basically happened in bullet time. It was maybe 10 seconds at most.

**I held my ground and he held his; he was tailgating way too aggressively so I gave a little break check.**

The SUV backed off suddenly and seemed to get the message at first. While he was backing off, I was starting to pull ahead of the car that was blocking the middle-lane and \*probably\* could've safely cut over in front of them but I didn't.

But that only lasted a few seconds. The SUV began creeping up on me again. By this point, \*he\* could've cut to the middle lane safely too. Either of us could have, but neither did. He wanted to prove his might and make me move over, and I didn't like being tailgated. Neither was budging. I had sped up to about 95 by this point btw. My engine was straining because the car was a POS.

**He aggressively flew up so close I literally thought he was going to ram me.**

I was actually surprised he \*didn't\* hit me, that's how close he was. I couldn't see most of his grill in my rearview at all. I panicked for a second and slammed on the gas pedal to get some space behind me. And here's the big fuckup: Once I had about a car length of space, I gave him another break check. It was a brief tap, not enough to make my tires squeal or anything. But still, a break check at over 90mph while being tailgated.

The SUV's driver lost control of the vehicle. I saw him veer onto the median to my left and he actually began \*passing\* me at first. This makes me think that maybe my break check came at the same time as another one of his ramming bluff attempts; he was speeding up at the same time I checked him.

While still on the grass median he slowed slightly, suddenly cut hard to the right to try to get back on to the road (hopefully not to try to ram me?) and I saw the SUV in my rearview as he overshot the turn and went rightward nearly perpendicular to the highway. He went across all three lanes, went down noseward into the ditch, and slammed into the embankment. I watched the SUV shrinking into the distance in my mirror as it flipped up in the air, rolled over and over several times and came to a stop upside-down just above the ditch.

**The SUV was upside down, all of its windows shattered, probably half a mile behind me by now.**

I was frozen. My knuckles were white on the steering wheel. The song ""Guilty"" by Judge D was playing, appropriately enough, and this scene was permanently etched into my brain while watching what just happened. All the moral questions and doubts and what-ifs and holy shits were flooding my mind at once. In the span of maybe 1.5 seconds I contemplated what just happened and my role in it.

Why didn't he pass on the right instead of the median? Why didn't I? Did anyone die? Was there a baby in the car? Holy shit what if I just killed or injured somebody? Are the cops going to catch me? How fucked am I? Am I going to be able to live with myself if I don't pull right the fuck over right the fuck now?

**I decided to do the right thing or at least something close to it.**

I pulled over. I got out of the car, began calling 911 while sprinting desperately toward the scene. I didn't give my name but I kept things vague for now, just in case. I told them an accident happened and there may be injuries, and gave my approximate location. I ended the call, still sprinting and out of breath, as I approached a group of other drivers who'd pulled over about 50 yards from the SUV.

From this distance I could see its windows were all shattered and the driver and passengers were standing around looking pissed. I asked the group near me whether anyone was hurt and what happened. One of them told me he'd just come from talking to the driver and said nobody was hurt but they were furious about some asshole that had ""tried to ram them off the road"" (which I did not do).

That was enough to satisfy my at-that-time greyish moral compass. I felt like there was no benefit to me sticking around and getting fucked over by his situation; it was physically a one-car accident, nobody was hurt, and he was not able to control his vehicle.

Looking back, I'm selfishly glad I stopped. If I hadn't, I would still be wondering to this day (15ish years later) if someone's child was killed or something.

**So here's my moral dilemma. How much of an asshole was I?**

If someone else were telling this story I'd probably go with ESH.

**In my defense:**

* Point 1: He was the one in control of his vehicle, not me. He made the decision to swerve left onto the median instead of right into a clear lane. He had made the decision to aggressively tailgate me, repeatedly, until he lost control of his own vehicle.
* Point 2: He was being recklessly aggressive. A responsible driver should maintain enough distance in front of them that \*any\* emergency can be responded to immediately. The driver in front (me in this case) could break or swerve at any moment to avoid an animal or obstacle, and you have to be prepared for that. He was unable to control his vehicle when the emergency arose (my brake check).
* Point 3: This was entirely unnecessary from the beginning. We were both already significantly speeding when he first approached me, and 85mph is a very generous cruising speed on a 70mph highway on a clear day.

**In his defense:**

* Point 1: If either of us should have moved to the middle lane, it's me. It's illegal to pass on the right, so while it would've been safer for him to do so, it was really \*my\* responsibility.
* Point 2: I didn't have to brake check him. I could've slowly coasted until he passed on the right, I could've sped up, I could've done a lot of things. But I chose to tap the brakes at over 90mph while being tailgated.
* Point 3: I also did not approach him directly or speak to the police. I felt like I wasn't \*really\* involved in the accident, since our cars never touched, but I'm not a cop and it's not my place to make that call.  

(side note, not really relevant.. I have changed my driving habits significantly since then. I now get the fuck out of the way when someone tailgates. It's not worth it.)

**TL;DR**: Brake-checked an aggressive tailgater when I could've safely gotten out of the way. His car was destroyed, nobody was hurt, and I peaced the fuck out","YTA.

2144,"WIBTA - for pointing out to a struggling artist they shouldn't ignore financial donations Hello, trusted asshole detectors. Here is a chance to keep someone from maybe being a total asshole. So, my story is this: There is an online writer I enjoy who, besides providing quality writing, quite heavily prompts any readers for donations to support their ongoing writing efforts. I started reading them when they were doing zines (years ago!), and now quite enjoy their blog and the occasional article they produce for other sites.  
I have made 2 different donations in the recent past, $100 each time. Not a shit ton, but given in good faith to an online writer whose work I value. 

It may be important to note they write lengthily abut their own mental health struggles and frequently mute all their online activity when they are having a crisis. They report they are unable to hold a job due to ongoing mental health struggles, which is why they heavily prompt for donations.   


Also note that I am also not so hot mentally but I have a steady job and creative pursuits myself that I could always spend money on instead. I grew up with a mom who never had a job for ""mental health reasons"" so admittedly I might be harboring resentment about the ""too ill to work"" thing, but that also might be a red herring here. I just wonder if it's making me feel too harshly...  


Because I never did receive a private word of acknowledgement or a word indicating it was even received (each gift was provided with a short note indicating points of their writing that stood out for me). Yet the prompts for reader support continue. 

I feel like sending them an email that explains if they want to keep a regular roster of financially supportive readers then they should be acknowledging donations in some way. ""Donor engagement"" is actually a thing any successful charity engages in, which basically makes anyone donating feel like it actually matters, and increases the chance of future donations. I do not want to be a condescending dick to them, and I know in the scheme of things they don't owe me shit, however, this continuing promoting for donations now just grates when I see it didn't seem to even matter.

2146,"AITA for cancelling a trip to see my best friend because I dislike her fiance? Mobile. Throwaway account because I don't want either of them to know I'm me. Sorry this is a long post.

I (30's, f) and my best friend (30's, f) have been best buds for about 20 years despite multiple moves and huge life changes, both of my own failed marriages and some bad relationships on her part as well. We've always been there for each other and it's been a great ride.

So, she's with this guy (and I used to live in that area as well, so we have met and hung out on various occasions) for years now.  I've tried really hard to like this guy, talked to him in person, or on messenger, and in the background of our phone calls.  Several things have put me off of wanting to talk to him.


I planned a trip out to see Friend which would involve me driving a considerable distance (more than 8 hours) to spend 3-4 days there, and come back. I asked for 1 day where just the two of us could have a girls day (go get our hair done or pedicures, do some shopping, and maybe grab a fancy lunch or dinner somewhere with a glass or two of wine). All good, she wants a girls day and has missed me, and we're both getting excited about it.


Two days later, we're discussing our options and he walks in and commences to start putting in suggestions for things we might enjoy in the area for our girls day. I'm pleased to see that he's actively supporting of the two of us getting some time together. I comment that he brought up some good ideas, BUT THEN HE SAYS, ""I'm really looking forward to playing chauffeur for you two...""


Full stop. This was supposed to be a 'just the two of us' day. I explain this calmly. And he gives me a lecture about how as women, we are vulnerable out in the city and he's just tagging along to make sure we're both safe because it's his responsibility that I make it home safely if I'll be visiting them because having guests means you take full responsibility for their well being while they're there.


I came up with an excuse to cancel the trip because I feel like his need to constantly babysit and chaperone the behavior of two women in their 30's is messed up. I'm not a child, neither is my friend. We were functional adults before he came into her life, and I am supremely pissed off that I can't get one single day with my best friend in the world.

She says she gets where I'm coming from, and explained that he completely doesn't understand why this seems unreasonable to me. And that makes me feel like I AM being unreasonable.

It's closer to home, is more stable, pays a little more, and most importantly is a much less toxic environment.  The reason that it's a much less toxic environment is that at her current job she works under an office manager who got her job through nepotism and treats her employees like shit.  One recent example of this (among many) is that when the last employee who left put in their two weeks notice, she told them immediately to leave and not come back, not even allowing them to say goodbye to coworkers with whom they'd spent several years.

Based on that, I think it's fair to assume that when/if my wife puts in her two weeks notice, she will get similar treatment.  This would be fine except for the fact that she can't start her job until an already-agreed-upon date, so if her boss pulls the same shit we will be out two weeks of pay.

So yesterday my girlfriend came over to my house and she's usually over 3-4 times a week. While she's here she usually parks across the street, but since it's been extremely cold she's made the habit of parking in the part that separates my neighbor and I's driveways.

I'm just pissed because they used to be really nice and we never complained about them at all even though they have done many things that break the law. If they had just spoken to us it would have been fine and my girlfriend would have stopped parking there.

2154,"AITA for calling out a customer because I didn't believe his reason for not wanting a massage from our best therapist, then clapping back at his reason? I graduated high school last December and as sort of a fill in before I start college in the fall, I took a job as a receptionist at a day spa. Most of our clients are pretty cool and I have no issues with them. However there is this guy ""Ron"" who always requests the ""prettiest"" therapist and he just gives me the massive creeps. 

Ron had an appointment yesterday with our therapist named ""Jenny"" who is one of his favorites. Well in the morning Jenny called in sick. I made several calls to the number on file for Ron to let him know but kept getting a number disconnected message. Ron showed up to his appointment and I told him I'd had to swap him with ""Amber"" who is absolutely the number one therapist in the place. 

Ron told me he was not happy with the change and wanted to reschedule. I told him that we require 24 hours notice to cancel. He said that can't possibly be true if its ""your mistake.""  I told him he could either take the appointment with Amber or pay in full. He asked to meet Amber first. Well as soon as he saw Amber (she is very overweight) he said that he was sorry but he just couldn't take the appointment. Amber said it was fine but I could tell it really hurt her feelings, so as soon she went in back I asked Ron if he'd like to explain to me why he wouldn't take the appointment with Amber. He told so rudely that it was none of my business.  I told him he's literally standing in MY business. He was so rude I finally clapped back at him and told him either he take the appointment with Amber, he pay for it I would put him on the ""never serve"" list. He asked what my owner would think about this. I clapped back that my owner doesn't tolerate prejudice of any kind and Ron walked out. I immediately put him on the never serve list. 

Well this morning I got a call from my owner saying I didn't handle myself well at all and my employment is under review. I guess Ron called her this morning and absolutely lied about what happened yesterday. So I know how to approach the owner when she calls me back, can people give me feedback if maybe I was wrong yesterday? To me prejudice is never ok and it doesn't matter why.","YTA

Boy i'm gonna take some downvotes for this one I feel, but at the end of the day he's free to want the person he wants for whatever reason he wants. I assume Jenny has the ability to say no to customers that she doesn't want to work with (if she doesn't, that's a problem on your businesses' end.)

Since the lease started in June, I decided to take advantage of the fact and take some summer courses at my university while living at my house. My three other housemates won't be moving in until the fall semester begins, so late August to early September.

&#x200B;

The way the wifi works is we have a joint account with the people living above us (it's a two-story).

The trouble is, my one friend Jack (fake name obvs) doesn't want to pay for the wifi for the months of June through August. His argument is that since he's not at the house using it, he shouldn't have to pay for it. Everyone else in the house (at least, those who have given their input, which is most) is ok with splitting the wifi between all of us, regardless of whether or not we're living at the house.

We are then invited to the apartment of a girl one of the friends (21 y.o. ‘Jenna’) has been romantically chatting with for a couple weeks. This is the first person that Jenna has had any romantic engagement with, and I’ve been excited for her. 


I smoke occasionally, but my friends have never been high. They’re excited to smoke at a get together. We head over and it’s a good night. The new girl is really cool. Lets everyone hit her pipe. The new girl’s roommates are cool as well. 


Jenna and new girl have been talking to each other all night. When I did normal things to involve Jenna she blew me off. As a close friend I notice how she’s acting in front of new girl, distracted and fawning all night. But I had been having a good time with friend C all evening. I decide it’s dumb to be annoyed and they’re fine.

We had been in the living room all night. Then Jenna and friend B run off to another room. With Jenna gone, new girl then steals friend C away to the corner. So all friends have left, and I’m sitting on the couch thinking if I should get up and join their convos. I chill out, make a little small talk with the few other people there, but it feels like 25 minutes pass with my friends gone.


Jenna comes back. She sees me in the chair in the living room and does a cutesy little hello, says what’s up. I say “it’s lit” sarcastically. She looks really taken aback and asks me if something’s wrong. I’m irritated but don’t want to start anything. But she’s like... seriously what’s up. So I try to convey that she’s been fawning over one person all night when we’re as a group. I immediately say, “look I’m sure it’s just me being tired and high and overthinking. I don’t mean anything by it, you’re having fun it’s all good.” And she just looks uncomfortable. I don’t know what I expected her to do about it, and now she has no idea how to continue her night because now I’ve made her self conscious. I wish I hadn’t explained anything I was thinking.

&#x200B;

I'm 18 and an ACE certified personal trainer. I've been working as one for about six months now, while finishing school. I always start off by creating a profile for my clients. It includes name, age, sex, current weight, BMI, body fat percentage, any injuries, goals, etc.  

&#x200B;

My brother proposed to his fiancée two weeks ago. They haven't set a wedding date yet. At my grandparents' house last night, several family members asked me if I would be willing to help them get in shape for the wedding. I said of course, but that they would have to pay me, and I asked when they wanted to set up the appointments. They were fine with paying me, but they wanted to do the initial consultation then. I really didn't want to, but I agreed.

&#x200B;

The first few went over pretty well. Most were not thrilled to learn how much they would need to lose to be within a healthy weight range, and they weren't thrilled to learn that they would have to lose weight in an overall manner (or that spot training could make the problem areas worse), but they didn't kick up a fuss. Well, my cousin Natalia, 21, made up for them.

&#x200B;

Nat is 5'4"", 163.8 lbs. Her BMI is 28.1, placing her firmly in the overweight category. In order to have a healthy BMI, she would need to lose 18.2 lbs. (I'm looking at my notes right now to make sure I get the numbers correct.) Nat didn't want to hear this at all. She says that she's a size 6, and that means she *can't* be overweight. I showed her the charts and used two different BMI calculators, including the CDC's. She still didn't believe me, and she accused me of trying to humiliate her.

&#x200B;

This morning, I had a few awkward conversations with some relatives. Many were concerned about what I had told her because ""she really isn't that big, you know,"" and ""don't you think it's a little harsh to suggest someone her size lose that much weight?"" as well as ""you really should have been clearer when you said we might not want everyone to hear this."" They really made me question if I should have *insisted* that I do the consultations privately. On the other hand, I *did* warn them. Also, a few other relatives said that really kicked them in the ass to realize that their clothing size doesn't mean they're healthy, and they've scheduled appointments for the upcoming week, so I don't know. 

&#x200B;

She's not on social media, only goes to work and back home. On weekends she'll go to the movies with my parents or to the spa.

Since my wife and I live nearby we ask her to come chill with us and our friends (who she knows) on Fridays but she never ever does.

Soon after she got super into a TV show. She’s obsessed with it, she’ll watch every episode at least twice when it comes out, rewinds to watch her favorite scenes multiple times and reads fanfics all the time. 
The show is based on a book series and I read the entire series back in high school.  The show is incredibly different and it’s not my cup of tea. 

Anyway, since I was familiar with the characters I would talk to her about them sometimes (book vs show) etc. Soon the show was literally all she could talk about, she would go on for hours at dinner and send me long paragraphs ranting and fan-girling over the show. I listened and engaged in the beginning. But I would change the subject, letting her know I was bored and hope she would get a hint. She did and we would talk about other things when we hung out.

Then the show got cancelled over the summer and that’s when she went back to her old self, she told me to support the show, call the network and ask them to not cancel it. She made a Twitter to try and save the show and urged me to do the same. I was sympathetic but a bit relieved that I wouldn’t have to listen to her rant anymore. Over the past couple of months she brings it up occasionally and I’ve told her straight up that I don’t care and I don’t want to hear it. She would still bring it up - “I know you don’t care but blah blah blah...” 

We had our spring break last week and decided to go to NYC. I couldn’t go sightseeing one of the days where they (her and one of our other friends) visited Central Park. There’s a bench there dedicated to the show and she sent me a huge paragraph fangirling with articles about how the actors were there and all.

This is what I told her - “look I admire how much you like this show (I was taking about how passionate she is) but I simply don’t care and I’ve heard you talk too much about them that I low key hate them even more now”

2181,"AITA for wanting to have a graduation event exclusively for an underrepresented race? Last month was the best month of my life- after years of busting my ass, I finally got a likely letter from Columbia. As a black woman who went to a predominantly white school (PWI) and the first person in my family to go to college, this is a REALLY big deal for me. I’m still so excited I can’t stop smiling :).

The issue here is that I’m in a group chat with 5 other students at PWIs in my city (not gonna specify, but very large and well known), and a lot of us got into top 50 schools. We discussed having a black student only graduation event, and inviting other black students and their families (we think we can get around 20 graduates). We want to invite kids from the lower income inner city elementary schools so they can shoot for the stars.

Yesterday, I managed to secure a venue at one of the public schools in my city. I was extremyl excited, and rushed to tell my friend Kate. Kate is one of my best friends at my school, and she is usually on board when I talk about diversity initiatives. But this time, she said “you know (my name), I’ve been holding this in for a month, but I got into Brown yesterday and the fact that you’re excluding all the other people who achieved their dreams and having your own special ceremony disappoints me.”

I tried to explain to Kate that the event was mainly to inspire black kids, but she asked me why not inspire all kids to shoot for their dreams. I pointed out that black kids tend to go to shittier schools with less opportunities, and need role models who made it. However, Kate just told me that all kids need role models, and implied I was an asshole for even thinking about this event.

So reddit- am I the asshole?

tl;dr: Want to have a faux-graduation ceremony for black students to recognize their achievements and inspire at-risk youth. However, since my event does not include all races, my friend Kate called me out for being unfair. AITA?

Edit: I want to elaborate on why this event is so important to me. When I got into college, my 14 year old cousin became  VERY interested in talking to me about college, and the middle schoolers that I tutor as well. I only want to have an event like this because it's the best way to reach kids who might not even have college on their radar. The reality is that in those school districts, there aren't a lot of poor white kids. I think it's the best way to reach a group that's underrepresented and a group I see struggle on a day to day basis.

If we were still together, I would have been honest with her from the get go, but we were just hooking up. I made it clear that I didn't want any feelings involved with Victoria. Eventually, Karen confided in Victoria that she had been hooking up with me, thus unveiling both secrets. Karen confronted me about this and we talked it over, and realized that we had feelings for one another. Victoria didn't want us to do anything with our feelings because that would ultimately hurt too much and ruin the friendship that she had with Karen.

So basically my mother has been cheating on my dad for 2 years (as far as I've known) and I've confronted her about it at least 10 times by now, even presented evidence to her and she always denies it, gives me the silent treatment, and yet continues(bc I overhear her phone calls). I even wrote her a letter telling her that I felt really hurt that she would do this and keep lying to my face about it. She still continued. I told my dad about it just last week because I simply couldnt take it anymore. There was a huge fight, which led to her denying everything AGAIN. She blamed everything on my saying that this was all my fault because I'd been spying on her nonstop (I didn't need to spy to know what was up). My dad said he believed her but he kept watching her call and text history over the course of the next couple days after the argument. (I told him the persons phone number). And they got into a fight the following day, ( my dad asked her who she was texting and she started getting defensive) which led to her giving us the silent treatment as she always does when something doesn't go her way.

I’ve gained 17 lbs in a year which is unhealthy. I exercise and am attempting to shed the excessive weight. Most of it is from changing birth controls . Mirena to depo back to Mirena. Depo is known to make people gain weight. I was one of them. I’m not the most comfortable at this weight and I realize that’s no ones issue but my own.

That’s the only time I will comment. 

I’m very upset because he knows I just got into an argument with a nurse practitioner. I had the start of cervical cancer last year and that was stressful.

By that i mean that i have a few very specific Things that just make me instantly loose all interrest in someone (for example excessively hairy arms) and most of them are based on Looks.   
Now the Problem was that she developed interrest in me, and we even had a Little bit of a fling afterwards, but we talked About a relationship and came to the conclusion that we dont want that from another. but then she started to become more and more attached to me (the typical Friends with Benefits Thing where one starts to like the other more than they should) so i talked about it with her, but she refused.

2205,"AITA for pulling out in front of somebody on purpose when they were obviously speeding? Right, so, this is going to be my first post here, despite leaving numerous comments, so, let's rock this.

Today, coming back from work, I pulled out in front of someone who was speeding, knowing that they would have to firmly apply the brakes.

Here's some context. There is an 4-way stop intersection in the town that I live in, which really should have a stoplight. The main road it intersects is a 35pmh zone that goes up to 45, and then 65 once you hit the highway. It's common for people to blow through at highway speeds. This is a huge issue with tourists, as this is a major tourist town that sees thousands of people passing through and visiting per day. Many wrecks happen here. I had just gotten out of the Maverick, (which is always busy, because it's on the highway and it's a Maverick) which is connected to the tie-in street of this intersection, and intended to cross the main road.

I sat there for a hot minute or two. Cars were starting to pile up behind me, because the road was busy and my work truck is all torque and gears with a grabby clutch, which makes it really hard to zip forward without outright whiplash-lugging the poor truck. Finally, there's a small break in left-side traffic and I look right. There's a car hauling some major ass towards the intersection, highway speeds--my guess is he was going 60 something. I could see the California plate on the front. It was another goddamn tourist blitzing through town.

So I went anyways. If he had been going the speed limit, or any reasonable speed, I would have had plenty of time to cross. He braked hard, flipped me the bird, and I kindly returned it and went on my way. I personally felt completely justified in my actions in the moment, but now I'm curious what you guys think.

Edit: Because I don't think I properly explained my head space. I didn't pull out in front of him *because* he was speeding. I did it because I needed to cross the road and I figured cutting off a guy doubling the speed limit would be fair game. I'm not trying to be Mad Max here. I just figured the two wrongs would neutral out.","YTA. You could have harmed yourself, the person you pulled this idiot move on and/or others around you.

2207,"AITA for using my past military experience and telling some friends to shut up during an arguement I know how the title sounds but I am not (normally) one of those people that always talks about military service/thinks I am a badass/hero/etc. In fact I barely talk about it at all. I don't use any military discounts or pump out my veteran status or anything like that. Most of my current friends are unaware I actually served as I do not have social media (so no pictures of that time) and like I said it is not something that comes up often.

So to go on to the story. This weekend a friend had a very small get together at his place (5 of us total). The Iran stuff came up in conversation. Everyone there seemed super excited about it. I usually keep quiet when politics get brought up as most of my social circle believes the opposite I do but this time I brought up my problems with this current event. 

Once I did it was like the floodgates opened and they were all saying stuff about national security, not supporting US,  accusing me of not caring if Americans get hurt, comparing me to sympathizers, etc. I tried to explain my position but they were not having any of it.

Eventually while raising my hand I said (while knowing full well I was the only one) ""so who here has actually served in the military? Anyone..?"" Then after a few seconds of silence ""yeah that is what I thought so shut up.""

The rest of the night was kinda awkward and it was already dying down anyways so I left shortly after. I am normally one to be chill and not let myself get so fired up.

So what do you guys think?

Additional info: I never claimed (here in this post or in the arguement) that their opinions on the actual event don't matter because they did not serve. I never said that because I was in the military that I have all the knowledge and know exactly what we should do. I never claimed that because of my service that only my opinion matters. I expressed that I don't think war is the answer, that I feel bad for the citizens there (especially if war does break out), and I worry for our service members out there.

My (24F) boyfriend (25M) have been together for 4 years, and have starting getting serious about the possibility of marriage and all that stuff. When the subject of children came up I said I would be open to have a few some day when we're both financially stable (I work a minimum wage retail job and he's a cook making decent money). However, he declared fervently that he was never going to have any.

Fast forward to this morning when I found a printout of instructions from a clinic on preparing for a vasectomy procedure. I immediately confront him about this and he said that he forgot to tell me that he's getting a vasectomy next week. I immediately flipped out and demanded to know why he didn't think it was important to discuss this with me. He said it was his body and his decision, and to which I said yea ok but you really haven't considered my needs at all in this. I told him that getting irreversable surgeries like vasectomies are incredibly irresponsible since he'll never know if he'll change his mind about it and that he was being an impulsive child. He said that since he and I are both environmentally conscious we should be against having kids but that I just hadn't 'come around to realizing it yet', which made me really go WTF.

A) when I'm at school, I try to do what school is intended for: learning. I'm taking 6 AP classes this year and want to keep up my GPA, so that means I need to pay attention and take notes, not talk to people. Hell, I even spend my lunchtimes studying 

B) I don't have anything to say really. I can't go around flirting with girls while all their friends are around, cause that would be creepy. And I don't really have anything else to talk to them about

Although they were broken up for a year then & he even had another relationship, he let her move in not charging rent. He even loaned her $12k+ for remedial mortgage fees.He pretty much knew he never would get it back.

So he meets me & we're in love but wont even drive me past his house for fear she'd see us. Wimp. We dated & had our trysts in his van for 8 months. But I loved him & mostly accepted it with occasional all out screaming matches about why he was too wimpy to ask her to leave. She had a few excuses of people who promised her a place but then these fell thru last minute. 

June 2018 shes gone & I finally move in. I had to beg him practically bc I had to sell my home & couldnt afford 2000+ rental fees while disabled. He charges me $700 rent monthly. Its been very ugly & I have deep resentment over how he made me feel like ""first runner up"" while she kicked back in his million dollar home. 

His mom still friendly w her & I think gives her handouts. I heard mom & ex had a christmas lunch. I went to Moms today & saw displayed a pic of the kid in the living room & I silently abandoned my half eaten breakfast & quietly left. He knew it was bc if the kid pic displayed. Mom doesnt know ex gf owes him $12k & he told me NOT to tell her. Mom would be very pissed. AITA for being pissed at this scenario? Thanks guys.

2225,"AITA for including my associate in a conversation with my CEO? (Just saying, I work at a startup company and I’m sorry if my writing or story telling sucks)

Yesterday at work I was having a nice normal day at the office. I thought everything was going smoothly but then our operation department informed me about something our VP wasn’t doing. What they told was pretty much, the VP pushed a shit load of work on them and kept saying to everyone in all the offices “we need all hands on deck, we need everyone to be working at 100%.”  Then after he gives them a lot of work he goes into our office (me, him, the owner/ceo, and another guy with the same position as me (1 position below the VP)) and just puts his feet up and starts watching golf or women’s soccer. (honestly forgot which one bc he’s been doing it all week.)

Either way he and our ceo leaves for lunch and I’m sitting there with my co-worker josh (not actually his name).  I tell Josh about the VP and he’s also pissed bc we’re doing all this work and he’s doing nothing.  Then he says some things I didn’t think of how essentially, the VP makes money off deals we bring in but we don’t make any off the deals he makes and how he’s pissed that he’s not putting the time in like the rest of us yet he makes money from all of us.  This wasn’t my main concern but it also bothered me bc he had a point.

After they come back from lunch, we work for an hour or so and then the VP leaves for the day.  He came in at 10 and left at 4.  Our CEO comes in at 8:30 and leaves typically around 6/8.  I personally come in at 7:30 till after my CEO  leaves.  I do this to make sure all the outstanding tasks for the day are complete and he doesn’t have to worry as much.  Josh comes in 9:30-5 which is fine because he’s productive. 

After the VP leaves I talk to my CEO how josh and I are pissed about what’s going on with him.  How he’s slacking and so on. (We can be transparent with him bc he’s asked us to do it before.)  After I bring up the points josh and I both spoke about my ceo leaves to talk to the operations department. 

 Then josh turns to me and goes “Don’t talk for me again.  I don’t think it’s needed and I can speak for myself.  Just don’t include me when you say we.”  Taken a back bc I thought we were on the same page, I apologized but had a sour taste in my mouth.  He said this in a very aggressive and annoyed voice but I wasn’t sure if I was in the wrong or not.  

After the ceo comes back and I begin saying everything as “I think”, “I disagree” instead of “we”.  After my CEO thanks me for my comments and then left early and so did Josh.

I come from a decent well off family and my father owns his own business. I’m on a payment plan making it so that the amount not covered by my loans is payed in 4 installments over the semester. These payments were taken on by my stepdad which I am extremely thankful for. This month it wasn’t paid on time which has happened. It usually doesn’t really matter or affect me. But because I had to enroll for classes and the payment hadn’t been made I couldn’t enroll for classes. After finding out it’s because of the payment plan I asked my stepdad if he had paid it he said no and he was planning to on Friday but could earlier if need be. He ended up paying not long after but I still missed out on getting my classes at the times I wanted and pushed my schedule back by hours some days. I didn’t bring anything like that up to him because I am in a very fortunate position. But I’m kind of upset just because he took this responsibility willingly to pay that way. I had been working full time and had a trade skill and only decided I wanted college at the end of high-school.

I had taken a vehicle purchased it and put all the work into fixing it for him and gave him the finished vehicle. He badgered me about getting it done quicker despite me always giving updates on its progress and what I was doing and then when it was done he didn’t have the money. I went on quite a while without getting paid till I needed that money (I had also paid for all the parts and the initial cost of the car) and he finally came up with it like 2 weeks after me being like I need this money now. Despite him constantly asking when it would be done during the fixing.

The mother had trouble reaching her GoFundMe goal  and cooked up the idea of a concert to raise the balance. Despite not  knowing the family, mutual acquaintances got the band involved.  Especially as my aunt died of the same illness, I was happily on board  to perform without compensation. Two other bands were to be on the bill.

I  didn’t meet with anyone involved until the day prior when my bassist  and I checked out the venue. No issues there. Going by the GoFundMe  page, the girl was out of town receiving treatment for ovarian cancer  that was spreading to other organs. The only discomfort I feared in this  situation was having to come up with something to say to the mother,  who had a good chance of losing a child. The surprises started coming  the moment we arrived. There was a booth with an Arbonne banner. Mom was  happier than a pig in shit, directing people like she was decorating  for a wedding. First thing she does is hug us; second, tell us she’ll be  streaming the performance on her Youtube channel exclusively; third,  introduce us to her daughter, purported to be near death from cancer,  who is playing on the floor with a toddler. Over the course of an  increasingly unbelievable conversation, it comes out that the ovarian  cancer was self-diagnosed and that the treatment the daughter needs is  to come from “specialists, not doctors.”

Of  the many available options people have since reminded us that we had,  the band decided to go ahead and play—as a platform for publicly outing  the mother’s deception. I have since been told that I jumped to  conclusions without seeking the full story, or that I failed to consider  that there were a lot of kids in the audience at 2:00 in the afternoon  when we rage-performed “Anarchy in the U.K.” with lyrics changed to call  out the mother as a total fraud.

She went on to tell me how vile the person was and how she was young, stupid, and upset that said event occurred (she was 19 yrs old at the time). Now normally, I would care less about her past and usually just brush it off - I am an adult and know we've all experienced cringe-worthy moments in our life which we wish did not occur - as what matters is I'm with her now and not judgemental of her actions.

I prodded with potential scenarios and she shot all of them down (e.g., he cheated on someone with her, he led her on thinking she'd get into a relationship with him and then ghosted her, he was rough with her during the sexual encounter, \*jokingly\* he killed someone and had her cover for him, etc.). She then changed the subject though her usual temperament was off. I rebuked her dismissal of the situation and told her how I've been an open-book since the start of the relationship, often being forthright with sexual encounters (even mentioned that she was judgemental over the time I told her I dated an ex-stripper for a short time who worked at Amazon when I met her) and that I had never seen her act this way.

So about ten minutes pass and my nose begins to twitch, I recoil instantly at the horrific, pungent scent of rotten eggs and decaying human flesh. I ask my mom ""did you fart?"" she shoots me an unapologetic smirk and says ""Yup!"" I groan and turn away, the smell eventually dissipates and I am able to return to my studying. A few minutes later an even more horrific stench than the last emerges and I shout ""seriously? just hold them in!"" My mom shoots back ""I can't help it!"" Now she seems rather mad. I should mention that she is on medication that makes her farts smell 100x worse than the average healthy human's fart. This time the smell doesn't go away, it seems to linger directly in the corner of the room that I am studying in. I get up and snap "" If I knew you were going to stink up the place I wouldn't have said you could come in here! How long until you are done?"" She snaps at me to watch my attitude and that she will be finished in half an hour. I leave the room and spent 45 unproductive minutes waiting in the living room for her to finish, then after she leaves I wait an extra 10 minutes to ensure all the offensive smells had departed as well.

My mother proceeded to ignore me for the rest of the night. Then this morning she lectured me on my attitude and told me I need to be more respectful of her. I get it, I'm an adult living rent-free imposing on my parent's space. However, I just wanted to fucking study without my eyes watering and my nose shrivelling at the horrific smells that exit my mother's anus.

We were discussing colleges as a group today. One classmate said he had to go to a community college because his parents wouldn't be able to afford to let him go to a more prestigious university. He is smart too and get good grades.

I told him he should try find a scholarship and that he can do a lot better than a community college. I told him to think about the reputation.

Students can also obtain an AA degree in Community College and transfer to University and obtain their BA or BS (then they would be even more qualified than someone only with a BA or BS.) Many community colleges have partnerships with Universities to provide an easy credit transfer.

2261,"AITA for not thinking misgendering someone is the same as using a racial slur? Long story but worth the read. There’s a recent meme that’s been blowing up on the internet lately of a transgender women who goes into GameStop and the cashier says sir instead of mam, which the transgender female doesn’t like. She (he) decides to kick stuff around (games), yell and demand that the cashier call him a her. In a customer service setting, it’s both respectful and a way to keep a customer but the other customer asking her (him) to relax got the transgender women upset, starts kicking stuff more violently and I believe even threatening the both the customer and the worker. I say this all because someone posted on fb that it’s never ok to misgender someone and that she (he) is a meme because they are transgender, which I felt it’s more the way she (he) acted. We got into a fb argument and the person who posted it explains how I’m transphobic if I think it’s ok to “pick and choose” when to respect ones pronouns. All I said was, if I were threatened and treated disrespectfully by a trans person, I would misgender them. Which got her super pissed and told me she was very offended. Look, I believe in respecting people’s pronouns but if they are being the asshole to you, threatening you or being hateful to you, you shouldn’t have to respect them as they aren’t respecting you. So I told her that and she goes on to say that misgendering someone is the same as being racial to someone, which I think isn’t true. Being a raciest and saying someone’s assigned gender are not the same in my eyes, especially when it’s said by someone who says she identifies as “various genders and no gender all the same time”. She then calls me a female (I’m a guy) since she feels I didn’t respect the transgender females gender, which is hypocritical as she literally told me that you don’t get to pick and choose what to call someone under any circumstance. I just believe to let live, if someone wants to call themself something, you should respect it but if you choose not to, it’s rude and shouldn’t happen; but it shouldn’t be the same as calling someone of color a racial slur.

2277,"AITA For Talking About My Fiend Without Her Knowing? Tl:dr  
AW 'copies' me and my friend's interest and styles and we talk about it without her knowing.  
Here's some context:  
Me: A semi-extrovert who likes anime, manga, writing, reading, and recently BTS and K-pop.  
GP: My friends who talks about my other friend with me. She likes to say she's an emo kid and she loves Panic! At The Disco.  
AW: Attention Whore as GP likes to say sometimes. I don't know if all her likes are her's but I know she likes BTS and everything Korean. Also maybe everything me and GP like too. Has a step-dad and complains a lot about family issues.  
Okay, the story begins. I'm transferred to a new class in the 2nd week of school. It was a High Honors class I think or SIG. You must have an average of 90 or higher to remain in that class ( Slightly relevant ). I knew most of the boys in the class from my old school and most of the girls if you could say that. ( I let them cheat off me a lot on every test and homework. Pretty sure that's the reason why they kind of like me. ) I found my quiet kindergarten bestie and we instantly reconnect as besties. Sadly my other quieter 4th-grade bestie was in a different class. The first day of the class it's warm outside and we decide to go out. That's when I met AW and GP ( A few others too ). They were on their phones watching something hidden behind their bags. I do the same and my quieter 4th-grade bestie does the same only with my phone only.  
Now, this continued for a few days before we actually spoke to AW and GP. We bonded about many things and it seemed like we all had the same interest. I said I liked BTS and Anime so did AW. I thought nothing of it because many girls like BTS and anime. GP mentioned how she loved musicals.  
Now here is where it starts. We start gushing over Hamilton, Dear Evan Hansen, Be More Chill, Mean Girls, and Heathers. We start rocking out to the songs and listening to them whenever we could. AW could only say   
""I like that too!""  
""Yeah, that's my favorite scene!""  
I figured she wasn't a hardcore fangirl so I showed her Hamilton. I started the shit-storm. We all started singing ""The Schleyer Sisters' when we wanted each other's attention. I found out later that AW had pretended to binge all the songs and only knew the ones I showed her. Around that time GP started telling me more about AW.   
Privately.  
She said things like.  
""I just said that joke""  
""I told her that before.""  
(One of her recent things was ""I told her I loved Sailor Moon. I even wrote a fan fiction about it. And I told her about how my Auntie introduced it to me at a young age but now she's telling everyone the same thing but about herself."")  
I at first simply ignored them and nodded sympathetically. I didn't really partake in the conversations at first. Until AW started being cold to me. According to GP, she had said that I was verbally abusive and didn't care about her at all. Which is wrong. I was just tired of hearing about how her stepdad sucked. But I never said that and just stayed on my phone, read, or just nodded.  
I started getting annoyed and shared my experiences with AW which were mostly her trying to steal my art style.  
Now just this Friday she broke down during last period in Gym. I was doing a few girls homework and helping GP. She was crying next to my number one new bestie ( I liked her bubbly personality. ). All I had heard before she started crying was ""I just don't feel like I can tell anyone expect \[ kindergarten bestie \] about my problems""  
I comfort her and hug her. I tell GP but she was skeptical. The day before AW had told me I would 'feel' on Friday when I made the joke I had no feelings. She was going on about how she doesn't feel accepted and that she needs to change herself to everyone's likes.

( Does that excuse you for copying her bio and her profile pic? )

  
Of course, I explained that makes it worse. She said that she had a lot of pressure from her Dad screaming at her and her mom and she was going to stop making friends. GP seemed to think she was just trying to be emo since lately, she was wearing all black. She said that there was one person that makes her feel terrible every day. Weirdly it was a girl we barely hang out with as a group \[ We suggested ourselves but she was quick to decline that we were suspect \].   
Am I the asshole?

  
( Also, GP made jokes about AW sucking her dad's you-know-what because she always sucks up to him. But like she also nicknames us pr\*stitute, wh\*re, sl\*t, h\*e. She also calls white people white-trash. I don't know if it's justifiable though. )","I couldn't fully comprehend your post, terrible formatting and poorly written. But I'm going to go with YTA.

She moved across the country. 

We're still in touch occasionally, but not as close as we used to be. Since her elderly (just turned 90) year old mother still lives next door and she was practically like a second mother, I grew close to her, especially after the passing of my own mother.

2284,"WIBTA for not telling someone their tattoo is wrong? I come from Ireland, which, like most countries, has it's own history, language, songs, myths, foods, all that stuff that makes a culture. I was raised in Ireland until I was 6, when I then came to England. I speak both English and Irish but haven't been back to Ireland in over a decade and have a decidedly English accent. However, I still have contact with my grandparents, I still know all the history, speak the language, know the songs and myths and cook the foods I learnt while I was a kid in Ireland.

I am in university with this guy. He is English born with Polish relatives, but he has what he calls a ""deep connection with Irish culture"". I did check and he said he has no familial connection to Ireland but he loves the culture and is ""fascinated"" with it. He has shown this in a few ways, which range from tiny things such as wearing an Irish football shirt, which is really of no concern to me, to him getting a couple of Celtic armband and cross tattoos (some of which are more Scottish than anything but go off I guess) and dressed as a Celtic warrior last Halloween (again, the outfit was more Scottish than anything). All of this has prompted eye rolls from me but no actual discussion on the subject.

But now he's planning to get this new tattoo. He wants to get it with his girlfriend, so they have identical tattoos. He showed me and some others at uni the plan and it says ""anam cara"". These are the words for ""soul"" and ""mate"" so I get why he assumed it meant soulmate, but the ""mate"" part actually means ""friend"". So the tattoos say ""soul friend"", which is basically the equivalent of them getting ""best friends forever"" tattooed on their arms. To reiterate: there is nothing romantic about their tattoo. If they showed it to someone who only spoke Irish and was unfamiliar with the concept of soulmates, they would be left thoroughly confused by the tattoo, as it does genuinely read ""soul friend"".

I've tried to explain to him before where he's incorrect with some Irish words/phrases. There was one time I started to talk about the myth of Fionn in uni and he interrupted to tell me I was pronouncing his name wrong. Whenever I bring up with him that he's just a little off about something related to Irish culture he insists he knows more than I do because of his ""fascination"" with the culture and has tried to tell me his ""deep connection"" with the culture trumps my actual firsthand lived experience within it.

2286,"AITA For asking my friend to pay a fee for being late on rent? My wife and I have a friend who was being kicked out of their current apartment and in desperate need of a place to live. We had just bought an RV, and could honestly use the extra cash, so we offered to rent out the space in the RV to them once it's ready to be lived in. The RV was a bit of a fixer-upper, so it has been undergoing renovations; however our friend was in need of a place immediately and couldn't wait that long. So, trying to be nice and help her out so that she doesn't have to live in a homeless shelter (that was literally her only other option at that point), we offer to let her rent out our garage until the RV is finished and we would even discount her rent until she was able to actually move into the RV. Our friend agreed to this and moved in a few months ago. Unfortunately, there was a little more wrong with the RV than we first realized, and the repairs ended up taking us a bit longer than intended since we didn't have the funds to get it all repaired at once. 

Everything has been going just fine until a couple weeks ago she decided to go on a road trip with some new friends she made. She told us she was going to be gone for at least a week, maybe two. Well, the first rolls (around about Nine days into her trip) and we hear nothing. We figured that she was probably busy having fun and that she would get back to us when she was able to. Four more days go by and we don't hear a word from her about the rent money, so we finally decided to message her and see how things are going and when we could expect her rent money. (Side Note: She agreed to the prices of $450 once in the RV, and $250 for the time she's in the garage. We did research before giving her a price because we didn't want to overcharge her, and the price we came up with was still cheaper than renting a single room in an apartment in our area. We all opted to not bother with a lease agreement (I know, dumb mistake) as we were friends and thought we could trust them to pay their rent on time.)

She then proceeds to tell us that she had some unexpected expenses, and could only pay us $150 this month. We then asked if she could pay a late fee to help cover the late fees we will be incurring from the bills that we planned to pay with her rent money. Our friend then says that she is being used and not valued as a friend because we asked her to pay a late fee and that she doesn't even like staying in the garage. So we tell her that we aren't trying to use her for money,that nobody is forcing her to rent the space, and that we just want to break even.
At this point we honestly can't tell if we're being the assholes here or not. We never intended to devalue her as a friend, or rip her off. We also had no idea that the Garage was that big of an issue for her, as she hasn't really said anything other than the occasional ""How's the RV coming along?""
So we are just honestly wanting to know if we are being unreasonable here. 
I'll post the exact text exchange in the comments.

Edit for clarification: We never told her that the RV was going to be done for sure in any set amount of time. We told her MAYBE a month, but that was never a guarantee, so we're not sure where she's getting the two weeks estimate from, because that was never the case. The tent was entirely her choice though, and honestly makes her situating sound worse than it is. We offered to help her turn the garage into more of a bedroom until the RV was finished, and we set her up with a little stovetop, microwave, and mini fridge. But she declined the help to turn it more into a room and just wanted to set up her tent.","YTA. You don’t have a lease agreement, you can’t just charge for things because you want to.

2289,"AITA for not wanting to compromise on having the type of wedding I would be comfortable with? My bf and I have been living together for 4 years, so we’re practically already married but it feels important to him that we make it “official”. I’m not sure that it’s something that’s very important for me but I have nothing against marriage on a whole. I’m the type to always cry at weddings even if they’re just between fictional characters on TV, I find it all very sweet and romantic and I’m totally on board. Btw I say “bf” because he never really proposed, we just sort of started planning our wedding recently.

The thing is, a typical wedding is not really something I want for myself, for various reasons. It all boils down to the fact that I would be highly uncomfortable with a typical wedding. There’s just nothing about it that sounds appealing to me and I want my wedding day to be fun, not feel like a chore. So the only way I can envision us getting married is if we elope and/or it’s just the two of us. Absolutely no one else.

My bf on the other hand thinks that’s the most horrible idea on Earth. He thinks it wouldn’t be a proper or serious wedding if the people he cared about (his parents and siblings) weren’t there. 

We literally just had a conversation about this that ended up with somewhat of a fight and him storming away. He says he just can’t understand the source of my discomfort.

She was a manipulative narcissistic sociopath. I don't want to delve into all of that right now, other than explaining she made what were supposed to be the happiest years of my life a living hell.

I finally got out, and I've known my current girlfriend before. We started dating two years ago, had a child, blah blah. There have been times my ex has tried to meddle, God forbid I try to be happy right?

First) My girlfriend has always known my ex's step sister, she's younger and was good friends with my girlfriend's ex-step daughter. But now she's been trying to get closer. Schedule play dates with our toddlers, and have lunches together.

Second) We actually found out last year that my ex's half brother lives down the road from us with his mother. Recently, my girlfriend has drummed up a friendship with the mother. 

Third) I've recently discovered that my current girlfriend is following some of my ex's better friends on social media. For what reason? It wasn't explained to me when I asked.

Two things that make me think it's not all bad are the facts that my ex has told everyone she knows that I physically abused her, which isn't true. My girlfriend gets to set that record straight. Second is the fact that my girlfriend has a bit of social anxiety and doesn't make friends easily. 

So am I the asshole for being upset she's making friends with those people?

2294,"AITA For Cutting in Line and Yelling at a McDonald's employee. This just happened on vacation with my wife.

&#x200B;

My wife is a type 1 (juvenile) diabetic and has been since she was 10. We were in a tourist-heavy city walking around and taking in the views. Unfortunately, while walking around, she started getting light-headed. She pricked her finger to test her blood sugar and saw it was a fearful 41. Additionally, as far as she recalls, that is the lowest her blood sugar had ever been as well. For those unfamiliar, while it varies person-to-person, anything under 70 is considered very bad. Usually it results in the form of dizziness, weakness of muscle, and a slew of other bad symptoms. Even worse yet, she didn't realize it until we were in the moment, but she didn't have anything to bring up her blood sugar either.

Our options were limited, but thankfully, we were right next to a McDonald's and we figured it would be easy to go in, grab a soda, and bring her blood sugar up. Needless to say, it didn't quite go as expected.

This is where my assolhery comes into question. We got inside and all the lines were long and the room was flooded with people. I sat my wife down at a table at their bar area and skipped to the front of the line. I frantically asked if I could have a cup for a soda, as my wife is diabetic, and that I would gladly pay after she can bring her blood sugar up. The employees, as well as everyone I skipped in line, seemed noticeably irritated at me at this point. The employee agreed to giving me the cup, but I would have to pay first, as it was policy. I quickly explained that this was urgent and that my wallet was in the backpack my wife had, but he was having none of it. I ran over, grabbed my wallet from the backpack, and went back to the front of the line. As all the employees were tied up taking orders, I waited what felt like minutes (but in reality was maybe a minute or two) for them to finish up so I could purchase the soda. As he rang me up for the soda, admittedly, I angrily and loudly was expressed my disgust with the way they handled the situation. In retrospect, most everyone in the restaurant probably thought I was an asshole. I even think I could have handled the situation much better and feel bad for the employee.

2295,"AITA for being brutally honest with my 7 year olds about the difference between Asian and Western family dynamics? 

My family lives in a school district that's 80% Asian, mostly Indian and Chinese. We are white Americans. For a bit of background, I've traveled extensively in Asia, and known and loved many people from this part of the world. My kids asked me today about why their Asian classmates seem more serious and less available for playmates. I said a number of things that in my lived experience, are generally true, but are not particularly flattering from a Western perspective. I half regretted saying most of these things, because I'm almost certain they not be well received by many people raised in Asian families. I think this has less to do with how true it is, and more to do with it coming from someone who hasn't lived it.

•	Asians take a more cold and practical approach to raising families than Westerners do
•	From an Eastern perspective, our Western ways of leaving marriage to the irrational whims of love and lust are downright foolish and selfish.
•	Asian cultures just have more stable families, with less divorce and single parenthood. The price is more putting up with people you don't like.
•	Children, to Asian parents, are an investment in their old age, in places in times of no social safety net.
•	China and India are ancient cultures, that have refined their social orders over millennia of trial and error. Their ways work for them. 
•	Many Chinese and Indian people consider themselves more civilized than Westerners, though they will never admit to this.
•	I'm not sure if India has a similar philosophy, but to Chinese, ""Raise girls rich, raise boys poor."" Spoil daughters, so that when it comes time to choose a man, she can tell the difference between one who can provide, and one who is all talk. By the same token, be harsh to sons. Make them work for everything. This will build a solid work ethic and make him a frugal provider for his whole extended family. 
•	Making money is high priority. The relatively recent Western ambivalence toward this goal baffles most Asians. I qualified this by saying that if my kids decide they want to make a lot of money, I'm fine with that as long as they don't victimize other people to do it; but I don't believe in shaming a child who isn't money-oriented enough.
•	Education is highly important to Indian and Chinese families, family security through making money. (My kids intuitively agreed with this.)
•	Your Asian-background classmates have it tough in a way that's hard for you kids to relate to. They live by one set of values and behavioral norms at home and in their ethnic communities, and a markedly different one at school and around town. Have a little compassion for them, because that's tough and confusing for any child.

Gf (25) is living in NYC, I (26M) live in Mexico.

Saturday night she went out, got very drunk, I organised über for her but anxiety ruined my mood to go out so went home too.

When I got home she sent me provocative pictures, phone sex ensued.

Next day I confront her about last night and get mad because she didn't say thanks or sorry.

AITA?

  


Alright so the TLDR says most of it really but the point is that my gf is currently living in NYC and it's going well and all. However she gets way too drunk at times and I end up having to deal with it, which I do willingly of course and without any hitch but she promised she'd be more careful.

On Saturday she went out clubbing for the first time since she moved, but around 11 started messaging me saying she was 'soooo drunk', which got me worried as I know how she can end up.

She didn't have the über app (has now) so in order for her not to take the metro I offered to order one for her.

Meanwhile I was supposed to go out with friends, to enjoy my last weekend in this city before I leave. However I was getting very anxious and scared, mixed with a few things that have happened to her in the past and to myself recently, all of my intentions of going out vanished. That's still fine though.

This whole time, when I'm on the phone with her I act as if everything is dapper, because I don't want to have an argument with her when she's that drunk, I know she won't enjoy it, and knowing her she'd just end up insisting then that she can go home alone and etc. Which I wouldn't want because safety.

Now we both get home and I'm ready to go to sleep, but she sends me a provocative picture, and I've had a few drinks, and frankly completely stop being mad and we end up have phone sex.

The next morning I ask her how her night was last night, to which she says that she wasn't actually that drunk on second thought, and that she probably would have been fine. So I ask if she's happy with the night then, and she says yes. That's when I tell her that I am mad that she doesn't appoligise or thank me for yesterday, and that I don't want to talk anymore today and to leave it for tomorrow. She decides that we cannot stop the conversation at that which leads to an over an hour long argument.

She was mad that I didn't tell her that night that I was mad and that I had phone sex with her if the next day I was going to be mad. My point is that I wasn't mad when that happened and that I wouldn't have been mad if she would have simply thanked or said sorry.

We don't go often so I forgot about the footpath rules until I noticed the markings on the floor,  and was too far to mention this to hubby.  About 50 meters away I can hear my son start to wail,  and turn to see my hubby comforting him and some cyclist near them stopped briefly before riding off. 

I headed back to help calm him down, at which point hubby told me a cyclist had hit my boy then proceeded to yell at them for being on the wrong side of the footpath. 

I want to acknowledge that I appreciate why the footpath is designed this way,  and how frustrating it can be for cyclists who are constantly blocked by inconsiderate folks. So I acknowledge that my hubby might have been an asshole for not observing his environment better.  

But what kind of person hits a kid and then blames the kid,  not so much as an apology or concern for his well-being?

None of my friends have met him, and it's already a close knit group. I would feel awkward for him as he would most likely be a 12th wheel, I would feel like I would have to spend more time with him than my friends and boyfriend, and that I would have less fun with him around - since we dont have that kind of relationship.

This May my friend will be graduating university and invited me up to the Bay Area, where I used to reside, for her graduation. I obviously accepted and planned on going by myself. I used to attend the same university as her but life happened and I had to move back to Los Angeles and continue my schooling here. When I moved back to LA, I started dating this guy (22 M) I met on tinder. We’ve been together for almost a year now and have a pretty solid relationship. Anyways, I invited him to come with me on the trip as I thought it would be a fun road trip for us and a great first place to go for our first trip together. When I told my friend he was coming with she got really upset. She told me she wanted me to spend all my time with her like we used to. She didn’t talk to me for a couple of days and only got over it because I said I would spend a night with her while I was out there. This soon blew over. Tonight, I informed her that we booked our Air BnB and she asked again if I was sleeping over at least one night but I told her I wasn’t sure and she got understandably upset. I told her I wanted to get my money’s worth and stay at the air bnb as well as get the opportunity to have my first sleep over with my boyfriend. I understand why she’s upset but I think she’s being selfish. I’m only going to be in town for three nights and have one day planned around her and her graduation. It’s not like I’m completely choosing him over her or ignoring her. We have planned to go to our old favorite bars and clips every night we’re there but I just don’t want to sleep over. I’m going out of my way by driving 5+ hours to the Bay Area, paying for my an air bnb with money I don’t have, and spending every day with her. In the end, I just want to know if I’m being an asshole here?

2313,"AITA If I don’t switch rooms with my roommate? My roommate and I have been roommates for almost two years now. It’s been good and I have no complaints thus far. On our first day of moving in we were discussing who should get the bigger room. I was willing to flip a coin or something in that nature to determine who gets the room. My roommate INSISTED that I take the bigger room given that  I had the bigger bed, dresser, tv unit etc. Also I’m also a bigger guy than him, so he thought it made sense for me to have the bigger room. I didn’t argue with him. I accepted graciously and that was that.

Fast forward to now, I have been sleeping on the couch in the living room for the past few months. Last time i slept in my room was about 2 months ago. I often joke with my roommate about how the couch has become my new bed. I sleep on the couch often because after a long day of work, I like to kick back and watch movies til I pass out. It’s sort of becoming routine. The other day my roommate texted me asking me if i would be willing to switch rooms given the fact that I don’t really sleep in it anyway. I told him that while i don’t sleep in there very often, I still do hangout in there to use my computer and stuff and that if he wanted the room, he should’ve let me know from the beginning and we would have decided fairly.

In the beginning I would have been fine with either room. But after almost two years, I’ve gotten comfortable with this one and i don’t really feel like switching. I explained this to him and he seemed fine at first, but he’s starting to act a bit strangely distant from me. We’ve become very close and now I’m starting to wonder if I’m being an asshole here.

2318,"WIBTA for chaperoning my 14 y/o field trip when she doesn't want me to go? My daughter and I are having a discussion about a upcoming field trip that I would like to chaperone. The paperwork has already been submitted but there is a lottery as to who gets to attend as chaperone. According to her, not many parents  have volunteered to chaperone so there is a good chance that I will get selected. 

Today my daughter informed me that she would not like for me to go because ""kids are mean and they will make either fun of me or her, perhaps both."" 

I'm very active in my community and my girls are often embarrassed by the number of people who know who they are just because they have met me in some capacity (they look just like me). Example, a 6th grader approached her today asking if her mom used to do the PTA. This embarrassed her because it came from nowhere and she had never met this particular person before.

I would like to go on the field trip as this is her eighth grade year and I do not chaperone in high school. So this is one of my last opportunities to participate in this kind of way. When I chaperone middle school field trips I give my kids a wide berth to be with their friends without me over their shoulder, unlike in elementary.

She also wants me to let you all know that I plan to chaperone the 8th grade dance as well. This is my second child to go through middle school and the first one will tell you I did not interrupt her and her friends at the dance. I let them have their own fun and they would not have even known I was there but I drove them.

As an educator, I know how crucial it can be to have support from parents on field trips and in the classroom. This is partially why I am so involved. Teachers really need our support. I respect that it can be embarrassing for the kids the older they get which is why I give them plenty of room when I'm present.

So, WIBTA if I attend this field trip? Your verdict will determine if I attend or not.

Update: thanks for all of your input. It was a wild ride.

**I will NOT be attending the field trip.** 

This was a lively discussion that was fun until I posted here. Big mistake. While happy that she won, my daughter was angry because ""these people assumed a lot, why do they keep saying you don't listen to me? We are talking about it, you didn't just say deal with it"". ""They are making seem like you're a bad mom and that's not how I feel."" - so, I stopped letting her read the comments. I took a tally........ 

I **would** be the ass if I did not listen to my daughter's feelings and attended the trip. 

I'm also the ass for forgetting about the mean things that are said on Reddit and exposing her to that. 

Apparently, I'm also the ass for saying ""as an educator"". That came across as know it all and annoying. My bad. 

Somehow, I was downvoted for admitting that me wanting to go was about me? That was just weird. 

I want to thank everyone who had a involved parent that was also shy and shared their experiences. That was the most helpful for me. Hearing what it was like from your end was a tipping point in shifting my point of view. As an outgoing person my initial response to my daughter was ""well, let's think of some comebacks."" That of course is not something someone that is shy would do. I didn't think about some of the other points that you guys have bought up. Especially the one person that said their  mother was similar and it was awkward having strangers know who you are and proclaim ""I love your mom"" when you are shy and not outgoing. I never thought about it that way- thank you. 

Lastly, to answer the question of what type of educator am I, I create and run supplemental programs for the school system. Think, after-school programs and the people who come in weekly to teach a particular skill-set. I used to work in the classroom with special needs children before turning my volunteer work into a business. This is why kids know me, it's not because I'm hovering over my children. It's because I'm providing support for all of the kids throughout the entire school system that spans from elementary to high school. I didn't make that clear so, I get the assumption that I'm just hovering over them.

Thanks guys. 😊","Being a teen is rough, and if she says this will make it rougher for her, I think you should respect that. If you want a good, long-lasting relationship with your kids, be a parent who listens and respects. She is old enough now to be part of the conversation.

2321,"AITA, boyfriend wants to bring group of drunk friends to our house My (21f) boyfriend (21m) is doing a night out with his friends next week for his birthday. We’ve been together 3.5 years and lived together 1.5 years, we rent a small house together and everything is 50/50 equal. I won’t be attending this night out with them and I don’t drink. 

The problem we can’t agree on is that he wants everyone (maybe 5-10 people?) to meet at our house for pre drinks and then go out to the town on a pub crawl and then finish back at our house and they make their way home from here.  He thinks I’m an asshole because I want them to just come at the beginning of the night and not at the end, he doesn’t agree and says it’s his birthday, his friends and his house too so he can do whatever he wants.

Reasons why I think I’m not the asshole and he is:
 This is my house too and he should respect my boundaries.
He says he’s never had his friends round before but he has never suggested it or seemed interested. 
I don’t want a group of drunk men around here being loud, peeing all over my clean toilet and missing and peeing on the floor, not washing their hands and touching everything, possibly throwing up, and being loud. 
I have work the next day and he has uni the next day too so I don’t want anyone around here late, I want to be relaxing.
I think his friends coming here for pre drinks but not afterwards is a good compromise because if it was up to me I wouldn’t want anyone around here at all. 
None of his friends live in this town so they will have to get the train or taxi home, the best place to get that would be from the town centre anyway. 

Reasons why he thinks I’m the asshole, and he’s not:
This is the first time he’s ever had his friends around our house.
It’s his birthday.
It’s his house too.
He says he will clean up any mess, make sure everyone goes home not too late, make sure they aren’t loud, etc etc.

BUT I know how drunk people can be, they say they won’t be loud or make a mess but when it comes to it they probably will.

2322,"AITA: I scraped my car (that my mom bought for me) and didn't tell her because I didn't think it was a big deal The title can't exactly get across what I'm going for. The basic deal is that my mom bought me this car for my sixteenth birthday. I'm super happy with it, I don't care that it's not some crazy expensive car or that it's the wrong color. I've had it for like a year now and I like it. 

Problem is, I'm a garbage parker and ended up needing to park in a tight spot. I scraped a light pole, causing some minor paint damage and one spot was wiped clean of paint (about the size of a quarter). This all happened a month ago, and this scrape was just now noticed. 

You see, I never told her because 1: I was scared and 2: I didn't really think of it as a big deal. It was just a paint scrape and I'm really new to the whole car thing so I thought it wouldn't be too expensive to fix with my own money. Apparently it's actually a $1000 job according to her and she wants me to pay for the whole thing, which I understand.

But I just got a job for the summer that's an hour away and I have to go through a really populated city so the rush hour is absolute garbage. I make $200-$250 per two weeks, have to pay $150 for insurance, and $40 at the very least, once a week, for gas. I just can't afford it. 

But she found out, and immediately started to yell at me about this scrape and she thinks that I don't care about the car and that all I do is complain about having to buy stuff. The only reason I complain is because I make next to nothing and it's kind of just something I like to do, I like to complain. But I can see why that would be annoying. 

I'm sorry if this whole thing is convoluted, I just need to know if I was in the wrong for not telling, and if I'm being an asshole for wanting at least a little spending money.","I dunno, but I'd definitely be getting your own quote. $1000 sounds like bullshit.

None of the parents appear to have any conditions that would require them to park in a handicap spot.

The spots are also the most convenient spots (closest to the building).  

I'm not sure if I should say something since nobody ever actually needs those spots, but it bugs the shit out of me every time it happens.  Some parents also park in the school bus drop off area (also very close to the pickup area), but they never do it when the bus is there.

2324,"AITA for refusing to let my daughters visit their mother? I met my ex wife when we were 8. We were hot and heavy really young, and had our first child when we were 16. I loved them both dearly, but following a mental breakdown I had when I was in my mid 20s we split up. Thankfully, our younger child is too young to remember the divorce. But even so, I still thought the world of her. It took me years to realize she wasn't a wonderful person. 

A few serious incidents finally sealed it for me, like her dying her unconscious sister's waist-length hair black and making her shave it in retaliation for embarassing her in front of a date. Or her punishing our younger child for wanting to see me. Or her cutting off our older child entirely for choosing to live with me and not her.

About a year and a half ago, she ""got a job"" on the other side of the state and started vanishing for weeks at a time. I didn't think much of it. Eventually, though, she just never came back. Ten months later, we found out she was in prison two states over. She was in prison for fraud, extortion, identity theft and practicing medicine without a liscense. My older child was furious at her, my younger child was just glad she was found. I was glad she was out of my life forever.

Both of our daughters want to visit her. The older one to chew her out, I think, and the younger one misses her. I will not take them, but I can't bring myself to explain why. I keep lying about not having time, and how we don't have a car, and how it's so far away, when I know full well we could make it. I can't take it, but I just can't tell them I personally can't deal with ever seeing their mother again. Or that I hate her. Or that some part of me still feels guilty about the entire thing, like it's my fault.

I can't stand it. I know my older child has figured it out, and I feel awful not being able to apologize to her. And I know my younger one believes me, which is even worse. But that's where I am. I'm lying to both my children, letting my own feelings override theirs and keeping them away from their mother.

Am I the asshole?

EDIT:
I have spoken to my daughters. My older child already figured it out, she already knew how I felt about her mother before this all happened. My younger child actually didn't cry, but it was a near thing. 

I told them both I'd see if there was a way they could go without me, probably with their uncle. Neither of them liked that. I offered instead to go with as far as the city, and their uncle take them to the prison. My younger child accepted that. The older one wasn't. I even offered to go with to the prison, but remain in the lobby, or the car, but she explicitly wants me to talk to her mother. I was afraid of that. I told her I'd think about it.

I talked to their uncle. He agreed to this plan. He also wanted me to talk to my ex, though, and he's bringing his sister along. 

So that's where we are. The trip is next weekend.

EDIT 2:
We went. It took 12 hours to get there and 14 hours to get back. The girls talked to her. The little one was excited the entire way there and sad the entire trip home. My elder daughter gave her mother a piece of her mind, but she kept it brief and quiet enough none of us could hear her, and was dead silent for the first half of our trip home before the boredom won out. I did not talk to her, and with any luck I never will again, her brother did and politely informed her that there's no longer room for her at their house, all her sister told her was ""You're dead to me."", which is pretty much my sentiment as well. Overall, about how I expected it to go. It was not pleasant, it was not productive, it did not make anybody feel better (at least not yet), and I think it's why the little one has needed affection more or less constantly all day today, but it's done.","Parent of a 7 year old here.

2335,"AITA for wanting to keep my deceased Father's house I'll be as objective and unbiased as possible so everybody can get the clearest picture.

My Father passed away just this past July. I live on the west coast and he lived in Florida. He wasn't married, but was engaged to a wonderful person we'll call Linda. She was madly in love with my Father, they bought a house together, lived together, and all of that. His passing was extremely hard for my sister who we'll call Beth and myself.

So, I just got off the phone with Beth and she told me that Linda had called her to talk about the house. The estate paperwork came in and the house now belongs to Beth and I. Beth wants to give the house to Linda so that she can refinance the loan for less payments.

I have a problem with this.

Before flying to Florida and being with Linda during this terrible time, I had only met her once and she didn't give me more than a single glance (which is fine, she was in love with my Father). I don't know this woman very well other than I'm relatively sure she was genuinely in love with my Father. I told Beth that the only reason why I want to make sure that Linda and her two kids are comfortable and living at that house is because I know that's what my Father would have wanted and not because I have any real ""mother/son"" affection towards her.

I don't know if she's a con-woman (probably not) or what her financial history is like or if she'll end up dating again in a few years and find a man who is manipulative and wins her heart in an attempt to take the house, I don't know. I don't want to give her 100% complete ownership of the house because as soon as we do, I lose any claim or right to the last house my Father was living in before he died.

Beth has a problem with this as she sees it as just a property. She doesn't care and just wants to make sure Linda has everything she needs to be comfortable and happy.

The conversation ended badly when I said, ""It doesn't matter, the paper work will need both of our signatures if we want this to work. These are my conditions and if people aren't willing to meet them then nothing will change with the house."".

For more context, I want her to be able to refinance the house in her name so she can get cheaper payments. I have no issue with that and I want her to live in it. I just want to retain a certain amount of control so that I can ensure the house will never leave my family. That was my condition, either my name is on the title itself (as well as hers) or she has to sign legally enforceable paperwork that dictates that if she decides to move and sell the house she has to sell it to me.

So, what do you guys think? AITA for wanting to keep my deceased Father's house in this way?

Edit: just because I know this will come up, no, this has nothing to do with money. I don't want to sell the house myself nor make any sort of profit from it. I just want to keep the house because it was my Fathers. That's it. If money really was the goal, I could legally evict them and either sell it myself or have people move in to start paying rent.

Edit 2: Yes, they both bought the house but the house and mortgage was in his name. My Dad did this for a reason: Linda's ex-husband tried to defraud the IRS and she was penalized for it. He wanted to ensure that the IRS or the ex-husband couldn't go after his finances as well or their house if her name was attached. However, everything was 100% in his name.

Edit 3: He did have a will but Beth fucking lost it. Since we couldn't find it, we ended up going with Florida law that dictates everything goes to the husband/wife or the children. Since they weren't married, everything went to us. My Father didn't inherently leave us the house in the case of his death. Also, I did not live/grow up in this house.

Edit 4: one of you asked the question that I needed to read: ""Who would your father have wanted the house to go to?"". I can honestly say I think he would have wanted Linda to have the house. So, just so everybody knows, I just texted Beth and told her I changed my mind. Let's give her the house. Thank you to those who were calm and patient and not rude who helped me understand.","YTA.

Throughout the entirety of my relationship my fiance's brother and sister-in-law (brother's wife) has treated me like dirt by spreading nasty rumors to other members of the family and constantly insinuating that I mean nothing to my then boyfriend because I am just simply ""another girl in his life."" After some time my fiance did distance himself from his brother. He basically told him that he would not accept this sort of treatment toward me and if he couldn't act like a decent human then he didnt want him in our life. However, my fiance is extremely close to his nephew and would do ANYTHING for him. They are only 6 years apart (him and his brother are 15 years apart) but when things got rough his nephew was quick to throw me under the bus and say nasty things about me to his parents. This happened about 2 years ago and I have yet to receive an in person apology. The only apology that I have received was because my fiance told his nephew he needed to say something to me. The resentment and anger has only grown to the point where if I even think about the situation I start to shake in anger.

I’ve known this person since the beginning of freshman year (now I’m going to be a senior). I felt like we were decent friends at first, but then over time I felt sort of distant to him, we just don’t really have anything in common, however he feels that we’re good friends. A few months ago, over text, I told him how I felt about our friendship, saying that I didn’t feel a strong bond. Then not too long after, I believe he brought up hanging out, but I told him again how I felt (this was in person). 

Just a day or two ago he asked when we could hang out again since it’s summer break. I felt like I made myself clear when I told him how I felt, but idk. I‘m probably going to have explain sooner or later again anyways. W/AITA for not responding?

Edit: Grammar, and some info that might be relevant.

2348,"AITA for wanting more sex with my girlfriend? Sorry for the Wall of text but there’s a lot of detail to this story so let’s start off at the beginning.

My girlfriend(21) and I(26) have hit a rough patch in our relationship after dating for two years and it’s about sex. We haven’t had sex for the past 6 weeks and it’s really started to build up sexual frustration inside of me. She knows that this bothers me but doesn’t have sex just because she’s a little tired(even when she wants it as well). This happens all of the time and it’s usually me who initiates sex because she’s never been the aggressive type to start it. This really bothers me because I feel like I have to force myself into her just to get her into the mood but she reassures me that this is how she likes it. I feel uncomfortable with this because I don’t ever want to cross the line and go to far.

Another thing to add is that we don’t get very much alone time to begin with because she still lives with her family due to her culture(she’s from Mexico) so the time we can sleep together in the same bed is super limited with no one being there. Even when the stars align and we have the night to ourselves she still pulls the “tired” card even knowing it may be a long while before we get a chance like this again. So today I got mad at her for not having sex even when she said she was in the mood but just a little tired. We ended up getting into a huge fight about it because it doesn’t seem like she’s physically attracted to me anymore because the passion and all the small things we use to do to show interest are just gone. She doesn’t text me cute and sexy things anymore, she doesn’t grab my butt or whisper things into my ear anymore. It just all randomly stopped. I told her that I’m like any other human and want to be physically showed that she still thinks I’m attractive(she ensures me that she still finds me attentive) and then she yells at me telling me that I don’t respect her feelings because she didn’t want to have sex because she was a little tired (even though she’s having the urges to have sex with me). She then tells me that everyone would be disgusted with me for even having his conversation and that I’m an asshole for even talking about this topic. I’ve respected everything that her culture and family have thrown my way from not being able to spend the night over at her place until we get married, she’s not allowed to spend the night at my place but somethings says she’s spending the night at friends to sleep over. Even then a lot of the time we don’t have sex. I try my hardest to except her way of life but when I bring up the sex topic she doesn’t understand that it’s incredibly important to me not only physically but emotionally as well. I want to be showed that I’m still attractive to someone else. She puts me as this pervert who should be ashamed of myself if anyone knew that we have this fight. 

Also she has expressed that sex isn’t the most important thing to her in a relationship since the very beginning (it’s not for me either but it is important) but she’s always loved it and was happy to do it frequent for the first year and a half of our relationship.

2349,"AITA for sleeping on the same bed with my friend? So to preface I’m a girl(22F) my friend that I slept with is a girl named Emma( 22F) and I have a boyfriend Ash.(20M) Ash and I started dating a little over a year ago. I’m openly bisexual and have dated women before and Ash knows all about it. A couple days ago Emma and I spent some time at our house just hanging out, drinking, and eating some edibles. We were watching a movie on the television in the living room of my apartment. Unfortunately the television is pretty old and is prone to not working some of time. 

This was one of times, the audio became really weird and there was static noise. We tried fixing it, but we eventually gave up and went to my room to watch on my computer. Now marijuana makes me a bit sleeply, but nothing too bad. However, Emma and I didn’t make the edibles another friend of ours did and gave them as a gift. What we didn’t know was that our friend likes to make the edibles really strong. So we both took a little bit too much and we ended up falling asleep on my bed. 

A few hours later my boyfriend swung by and found us sleeping together on the bed.(just for clarity nothing sexual happened at Emma and I just ended up falling asleep and cuddling) We were cuddling and both of us were in tank tops and boy shorts. My boyfriend woke us up and freaked out accusing me of cheating. Now he did calm down a bit and he believed me when I said I wasn’t cheating, but he’s still really angry. 

He saids that falling asleep and cuddling with another person is a big no no especially since I’m bisexual and things could get sexual quickly. I told him that’s ridiculous. Emma is mostly straight and although I do love her, I love her as a sister of mine not a romantic option. We argued and he eventually stormed out of the apartment and we haven’t talked since. That was two days ago and I’m wondering if was in the wrong. While I get some of his points I think at minimum he’s overreacting to whole situation. Am I the asshole?",YTA...

2350,"AITA for being mad at my GFs mom over her enormous student loan debt My GF and I just recently graduated from college. Starting in college my GFs mom handled all her finances and told her that it was all taken care of. I handled my own finances with the help of my parents. My parents described the loan types and walked me step by step through the process. 

I ended up graduating with less than 10,000 in student loans but my GF graduated with around 80,000. She let her mom handle it all and her mom told her it was all fine. 

Her mom also took out over 40k in parent plus loans. The interest is a wicked 7% and it has less repayment options. She fully intends on having my GF pay back the loans she took out. I'm personally mad at my GFs mom for letting this financial mess spiral out of control.

2354,"AITA for donating my kids Christmas presents? Edit: i appreciate everyone’s feedback! Definitely wasn’t expecting that level of hate. I will just donate the gifts without the letter, and ask for them to gift experiences instead! 

 A little background....my kids are incredibly spoiled when it comes to Christmas. We don’t have a huge family, but tend to get a ton of presents from relatives. For the past few years we’ve asked them to stop giving presents. We’ve suggested a few other ideas such as putting money into a savings account for the kids. But every year the kids still get a TON of presents. 

We are trying to cut back on presents because most of them are cheap plastic crap that will just end up in a landfill when my kids get bored. It also takes the meaning out of the gifts they get when there are 40 + presents to unwrap. So this year we are doing 4 presents for each kid.


So once again I get 6 packages delivered today filled with tons of plastic toys from amazon. This is after asking family once again not to buy toys. I told my husband I’m going to send a letter to them saying “Thank you for the gifts. The kids and I have decided to donate them to toys for tots this year since they have so many toys already”

When she asked why we should leave so early, I responded and told her that it take us 45 minutes to get to the airport instead of the 30 minutes we initially anticipated it would took. She said that waking up at 4:45 was unreasonable and suggested I uber instead. She claims that she has an important report for tomorrow and waking up at 4:45 would cause her to be sleep deprived and not give her the attention to detail she needs for the report (she works 9-5).

2359,"AITAH for giving my grandmother back her gift? TL;DR at the bottom, sorry it's so long for those who read whole thing.
Backstory: I have been trying to ostracize myself from my mom's family for 3 years now. They are not toxic or abusive, but their energy and hard-core Christianity is very abrasive IMO so I cut them out. Also important for later I'm a massage therapist 6 days a week which means no hand or arm jewelry while working.

I have stopped showing up to Christmas and other big family events I only show up to my brothers events since he is the only one in the family I give a shit about. My grandmother has been holding on to the ""Christmas gifts"" brings them to my brothers events and forces me to open them at the dinner table everytime. It's already awkward af receiving gift on my bro's b-day or Easter (honestly any holiday my brother hosts there is a chance of this) then I open the gift and it's always an expensive looking bracelet. The first bracelet I got I tried to decline and politely explain that due to my career I can't wear bracelets even followed up with the types of jewelry I can wear/appreciate in hopes of preventing another bracelet. I had 3 bracelets from her none have ever seen the light of day just sitting on top of my jewelry box collecting dust.

The day before Thanksgiving she shows up to my work before my shift give an envelope addressed to me to one of my coworkers to hand to me when I get in. I got to work was handed an envelope with $150 cash. I was first puzzled and then furious once I realized who it came from. To anyone scratching thier head why I would be upset about receiving money it made me feel like a cross between a charity case and having my love bought. I financially fine I don't need my retired grandmother's money she probably has less than me. My grandmother came in later that day while I was decorating for black Friday my coworker who gave me envelope escorted her to where I was. I took one look at my grandmother and stated ""if that was a bribe to show up to mom's Thanksgiving you can have it back."" that apparently offended her cause she half screamed ""no I don't want it back!"" She stormed away I shout behind her ""What was it for then?!"" She was already gone.

The ""Thanksgiving gift"" was my last straw I put all the bracelets and cash in a bubble envelope left it in her mailbox in the wee hours of the night it was one of the most freeing experiences I have ever had. I woke up to a couple of texts from Grandma asking how could I do this why won't I let her connect with me and got a fair lash back from my mom about why can't I just accept gifts and say thank you. Am I as much of an asshole as my family makes me sound?

TL;DR: Grandmother tries buying my love with cash and impractical gifts I give it all back to her. AITAH?","YTA. You told her to stop buying you bracelets, so she’s giving you cash instead. That shows a respect for your boundaries and receptivity to feedback. Maybe it’s not because she’s trying to buy you; maybe she’s just showing you that she still considers you part of the family and she hasn’t forgotten about you and doesn’t want to give up on you.

You don’t have to go to Christmas. But you should make more of an effort to be kind to your grandma, who clearly misses you.

2362,"AITA for wanting to rehome the dog I had for safety in a city unsafe for women living alone so I can move somewhere safer where I will have a better and safer quality of life? After graduating my master's degree, I was offered a pretty good graduate job in a major city. It paid decently, but not enough to be able to live in an apartment down town. I am single so to live about 15-20 minutes away from downtown in a 1 bedroom suburban townhouse (share-housing is not a thing here, they are tightly regulated too) and big cities in my country, including this one, have moderate problems with crimes like break and enter, and a lot of perpetrators have done it to women they have observed enough to deduce they live alone and assault often happens to women whose homes have been broken into. 

I am not a dog person at all but it is widely recommended for women living alone here to have a dog for protection. Having dogs reduces someone's risk of attack & dogs have protected many women. So I got a German Shepard even though I didn't really want to deal with a dog because of cost and having to walk them etc. My mother has severe anxiety and hated the idea of me having to live here and felt a lot better knowing I had a dog in the home. 

I have gotten a big promotion that means I can afford to rent a great place downtown in a very secure apartment complex with 24/7 security guards, cameras, and someone always at the front desk, directly across the street from bus/metro, and literally 8 doors down from the building I work in. I also get a free clean by a maid once a week. I will be a lot safer and happier living there and will be able to do things with friends after work/weekend evenings without having to be home by sunset (between 6-7pm depending on time of year) for safety. I also have to be home straight away at least 3-4 days a week to walk the dog so they don't go crazy with cabin fever. 

I can't have a dog in the apartment. That’s not a real for just my proffered complex. No attended apartment complexes like the kind of one I want to move into allows dogs. Cats are generally allowed, but not dogs because of the barking. 

I only had the dog for safety and quite frankly, while I don't hate the dog, I found needing the dog a burden and quite annoying, especially because my new income will allow me the means to travel and dog daycare places (sorry, I don't know the English word) are so expensive here.

I want to rehome the dog. It will be easy to find a good home, many women need dogs that are already grown. But some people seem to think I’m horrible for wanting to do this, even saying I ""need"" to stay in the townhouse with the dog when there are literally 0 advantages to staying here and not moving into the apartment. Most of the people saying it are women who live with husbands and who got little dogs because they wanted a cute pet. Not the same thing! 

AITA for wanting to get out of the dangerous suburbs and rehome the dog so I can move somewhere safer where my quality of life would be better? I wish I didn't have to get the dog to start with, but we sadly live in a world where women feel forced to do things like this for safety.","I’m gonna say YTA even though you should rehome the dog.

I’ve been working there for two years now as a backwaiter and for the longest time I’ve always gotten compliments from customers, servers, managers, etc. for my work ethic and pride for my work. Now I am in college and classes are very expensive and I also want to be able to live more comfortably and maybe even move out of my parents place into my own. So I’ve always thought being a server would be a great opportunity to do that because I’ve seen how much they take home every night.

EDIT: For clarification, this son is also the nephew mentioned in the title and the first gender reveal I did was just a cupcake for them to eat alone, not a party.

When my sister told me she was pregnant again I remembered the first time, and asked if I could have a redo. She didn't want to have a gender reveal party but I pointed out that she didn't do a baby shower the first time and people gave her shit for it so why not do a baby shower/gender reveal party. She wasn't sure but I said I'd take care of everything, both in terms of finances and planning, and she agreed. It didn't take much, just grabbed some paper plates and ordered a few pizzas, but the part I put serious work into was the reveal.

I made a tower of 36 cupcakes. All had gold cases and chocolate icing, 35 were yellow cake, 1 was blue. Whoever finds the blue cake announces the gender. It took a couple hours to make and decorate all 36.

I invited just family. Our parents, some cousins, uncles, aunts, and nana. 12 people RSVPd yes, and 2 of them had kids. Didn't do a headcount there were about 15 people, 3 children. As people arrived I explained the reveal and they all thought it was cute. My sister arrived, late, with her husband and my nephew, I explained it to them, and my sister thanked me for throwing everything together.

The party was going well, about an hour in and everyone had a cupcake but no one found the blue cupcake yet (I put it right at the bottom of the tower), I was talking to a cousin, and then there's a thud, followed by a series of smaller thuds. I turn around and the 6 year old nephew has toppled the tower onto the table and is punching the cupcakes.

Dad is nearest and he pulls my nephew away, but not before he punches the correct one, revealing the blue cake. Mum and dad clean up my nephew and my sister and her husband clean the table.

I yell ""what the fuck?"" Sister tells me not to swear. I say ""I'll swear if I fucking want to swear why did he do that?"" Sister says he's a kid, kids do dumb stuff and he was just excited, leave him alone. I tell her there's dumb and then there's this, and he should know better. Sister thanks everyone for coming, thanks me for the party and she, the kid, and her husband leave. Within half an hour everyone else has left and I'm clearing up alone.

Title.

I invited my friend today. She and mother clicked like wild-fire. They had immensely joyous interactions. I just watched solemnly in the background. My mother's charisma was intensely charming her. 

When she left, neither of us had a proper conversation. I wanted her to watch a movie with me but we couldn't do that.

2378,"AITA for trying to psych out the opposing attorney who was frivolously suing me? I was recently sued in a shotgun lawsuit by one of those shady lawyers you see advertising in cheesy commercials and on billboards. Basically, I had nothing to do with the plaintiff’s damages but the lawyer went after everyone whose name appeared on the paperwork even if they were peripherally involved. She knew that she had a weak case but she wanted to draw the process out in hopes of getting a settlement (fighting this was costing a lot of time and money). 

So it came time for the deposition. The opposing attorney was pretty scary because she is a real firebrand. She typically aggressively questions the deponents and wears them down so that they slip up and say something to hurt their case. 

My attorney and I diligently prepared for the deposition but I wanted to get just a little bit of an extra edge over the enemy. I came up with a plan to turn the tables on her and get inside her head. Before the deposition when we shook hands, I squeezed extremely hard on her tiny hand. I held the handshake just a moment too long. As we shook hands, I gave her a look that said “*I’m going to fucking strangle you.*”

Before the deposition started, I made sure to flash a lot of death stares her way. She is a small woman and I’m a big guy so I made sure to tower over her at every opportunity. While we were waiting around for everyone to arrive, I made fun of her law school (not very prestigious) and her law firm (known for being shady). I also mocked her appearance (she’s only in her mid 30s but has a lot of gray hair) and her outfit (looked cheap). Of course, I passed it all off as just kidding around. Since the deposition was held in my office, most of the people there were laughing at the jokes.

She obviously didn’t want to be in the same room as me (and I made sure it was in a small room). After the deposition started, I was more friendly and cooperative. I looked for laser eye contact with her at every opportunity. She looked anywhere but in my eyes during questioning. She seemed very nervous. She stuttered a lot and seemed to just be going through the motions. She was uncharacteristically timid. She seemed a shadow of the pugnacious lawyer that she normally is. When the deposition was over, she hastily left. 

My attorney thought the deposition went quite well. I was very unimpressed with the opposing attorney's performance. Sure enough, I was dropped from the case very shortly thereafter. 

The way I see it, I was doing what I could to win. She was using dirty tricks to harm my professional reputation and she had cost me a lot in legal expenses. My colleagues mostly agree with my tactics. Others say that I went too far and I may have traumatized a woman just doing her job.

She's absolutely perfect and I love her. Everything has been going great. I don't even think about the distance because our personalities match so well. She's the kind of person you'd marry and stay married too. A few days ago we were talking about previous relationships. It was our first time doing this in detail. She had some and I had some. It was no big deal, I really don't get jealous often. Neither of us have perfect pasts.

2381,"WIBTA For sending a furious e-mail to my cousin? Hi all,

I have a brother who is 13 and has pretty severe autism. He has moments where he can be loud but generally, especially in social situations, he understands to be quiet and to be relaxed. It’s just something he has trouble controlling. 

Anyways, my cousin’s wedding is coming up and we recently received the RSVP e-mail. My mom, my dad and I were invited, but the e-mail said explicitly that my brother is not allowed at the wedding. I’m over 18, so at first I thought it may have been a child-free wedding, but I learned that other children are going to be in  attendance. In fact, there will be other autistic children there. They are younger children, and very rarely verbalize much of anything.

I was very upset by this. It’s clear that because my brother can sometimes get restless and noisy, even though we will happily remove him from the room and can him down, he is being singled out. He has no long-term friends and relies on family to feel connected to anyone besides his parents and I. It became clear to me that my cousin values my brother less than me or my parents because of his disability, and I want to tell her that I have no intention of speaking to her going forward unless I receive a reasonable answer to this or he receives an apology.

For moral purposes, WIBTA?
I plan on sending the e-mail no matter the judgement. I would just like to know so I can decide weather or not to attend the next family Christmas.

Since the contract of the apartment will end only in May, last week a told me roommate about our decision and she freaked out, she still in college and don't have a stable income to pay for the apartment alone, I said I should move out in February and could help her finding a new roommate in the meantime, but she said the time is to short.

My friends think that I'm on the wrong for living her alone and agree with her that a should help her pay for the next months until she finds someone new for the nuisance, but I already agree to help looking for another person, her friends could help her too and I'm not rich enough to keep paying for 2 houses for, like, 3 months, so I said I'll prioritize my new house and boyfriend over her.

Two friends (Chris and Tom) and I bought tickets to go to a convention this weekend around six months ago as soon as tickets went live. We were all excited to go during the summer months and it was talked about quite a bit. Chris offered his car so we could drive to the convention and save money by not having to rent a car or pay for tickets.

After the start of the semester, my friend Chris started hunting for jobs. He got a position as an part-time EMT and my other friend T, and I were obviously very excited for him. The job however, has an orientation that is the same weekend as our convention. Chris decided to bail on the commitment we made 6 months ago to go to his job orientation. Now we have no way to get to our convention unless we spend money to rent a car, which is a big unexpected expense. Chris offered to pay half of our rental car fee but as our friend we want him there with us too. 

The reason I am upset is because there is another job orientation in a month that he could attend, but he is afraid of the possibility that the company will revoke the job offer if he decides to postpone the orientation by a month.

2387,"AITA? Neighbor and Fallen Trees I live in a state where if a tree falls on your property it's your problem. It doesn't matter if the tree belongs to a neighbor.

Last year my neighbor's GIANT (70+ feet) tree fell. It smashed my fence, messed up my new (6 month old) siding, and punched a few holes in my new 1 year old roof (new plywood, etc.. completely new). The neighbor paid to clean up the tree - and took down a few other similar ones that could be a risk. I expect it was quite expensive, as the trees were all massive. We covered fence, siding, and roof repairs.

Both of our back yards have a maintained section that's fenced in, and then a stream, and then a giant part (an acre or more) that's left unkempt and wooded. My yard has a bridge to get over there, but we never go. My neighbor doesn't have a bridge, and is an older gentleman and has no way to get across the stream in his yard.

In August, a big tree on my property fell into his yard, in the rough, wild section past the stream. I had no plans to move it, as it's wild back there and it's not doing anything that bothers me. My neighbor called and asked that I get someone to at least remove the part on his yard - probably 10-15' or so of it. And I didn't... mostly because it's hard to get any machinery over there, and also because I'm lazy and wasn't motivated to pursue it. At most I would get someone to clear it off his yard, and leave the rest on mine.

He had his 'tree guy' stop by a few times but he wasn't even sure he could get equipment close enough to do it, and didn't seem interested in the job. The tree guy told my wife that he thought the ground back there was 'too swampy' to move in his big equipment. A few times since August the neighbor has checked in to see if I was doing anything about it. I wasn't. Again - this is a wooded area, in part of his yard he can't even get to without a bridge.

Today he had a different tree service come to remove the part that is on his land. Again, in our state this is HIS RESPONSIBILITY. I texted him today when he told me they were there and said 'Let me know what it costs, I'll cover it'

And he said no. Oh, and he asked his tree guy to quote me to remove the rest and the tree guy said ""It's too big, I have no way to get it out of there....""

We are a military family and just arrived at our new duty station about a week ago. We chose the neighborhood specifically because of all the activities for kids (a huge centralized park with playgrounds, native desert, a swimming pool and a skatepark). 

My kids have always wanted to try skateboarding so after we got them all set up with the appropriate equipment, I took them over to the skatepark at the park. For the most part it was an ok experience, but I wasn't a fan of the language the teens and preteens were using but I figured that was their ""turf"" and the last thing I needed to do was start an issue with them. 

However, there was a much older man there, he just creeped me out. I'm not sure how to describe it. He had pads and a skateboard but he only rode it maybe once every 10 minutes. But something about his look just seemed off to me. He also reeked of marijuana smoke. Finally he actually ran into my son while they were at the bottom of one of the pools and I had enough because it seemed so deliberate. I first asked him if he had kids, he said something really creepy like ""these are all my kids."" I said maybe it's time he found a new hobby. He was so incoherent I don't know what he said next but it was something about his ""soul"" which really creeped me out. So I told him flat out I think it's time that he left. He said he was leaving anyways in 20 minutes since he had to work. I told him maybe he should just leave now. He said no. I said I was calling the police and finally he said that he didn't want any trouble and he'd leave. I told him if he didn't want trouble maybe he should chose age appropriate activities. What I hadn't noticed is that several of the teens were close by and when he left they said things like ""maybe your fat ass should be the one to leave!"" and b-word and c-word and on and on. I had also brought over a specialty concert chair to sit on and one of the kids had thrown it over the fence into the main park.  This truly scared my kids. I dialed 911 and we left the park. It took almost 4 hours for the police to come to our house and the officer said that in the future I should call them right away.

My girlfriend and I had a baby just under 7 weeks ago, and my parents are giving us money to help with all the new costs we have. We live at her house all together in a room while we save up to get a house. This means her parents get to see the baby all the time.  My parents have seen the baby roughly every 3 weeks despite wanting to see her all the time. 

My parents are always asking me to see the baby but my girlfriend will always kick up a fuss and making an excuse not to go. This was especially upsetting during the festive season as my family didn’t see her at all during this time. 

A few days ago we had an argument about something completely irrelevant and I brought this up. I said that I don’t think we should be taking my parents money if they’re not allowed to see the baby. She took this to mean that she was just after their money and so she got very angry and we are only just recovering from the argument that followed now. 

Am I the asshole for suggesting we shouldn’t take my parents money if they can’t see our baby?

2416,"AITA for not sympathizing more with infertile people? So I have autism and when I'm upset about an argument it can turn into an unhealthy obsession for days. I had a discussion weeks ago on Facebook that led to me obsessing for days because people saw me as a bad person. 

It was in a Facebook group about the show This Is Us. The character Kate is trying to get pregnant. Some fans irrationally hate her and botch about her a lot, I do not hate her but I may have been mistaken as one of those people. I stated that I have trouble empathizing with Kate because there are so many children out there who need parents, and that I hoped the show would address this perspective (it eventually did). I acknowledged that maybe I was an asshole but the more pushback I got, the more defensive and extreme I became in my viewpoint. I tried to let it go but kept seeing people say things like ""Kate is experiencing most women's worst fear by not being able to have biological children"". I'm sorry but if that's someone's worst fear, they need to get a fucking grip. 

To clear some misconceptions people probably had. I don't think it's wrong to have biological children. I don't think it's wrong to want biological children. I am aware that there are various reasons people who want to adopt can't. I realize adoption comes with its own set of issues. I have no issue with people who do both. I just can't muster much sympathy for someone who is in despair and feeling like their life is ruined because they can't have a child when there is a child out there in equal despair because they have no parents. People attacked me saying I didn't know what it was like to struggle with infertility. Well, I also don't know what it's like to be a child who needs a home but I bet they don't either. I was accused of having no compassion by people who said truly selfish things like ""why should I adopt when I have other options?"" maybe because helping someone in need isn't all about you? 

In a world with overpopulation, we as a species should be intelligent enough to say ""we don't all need biological children just because our bodies are making us want them"". We should have enough compassion for others to say ""Adoption will be my first choice, or at least higher on my list of options than a last resort because there are children in need"". 

Even if I'm wrong, I was still clearly coming at it from the perspective of a group in need. I weigh an orphan child's NEED for a home above some person who is well-off enough to consider having children's WANT for a biological child. I don't understand how people act like adopting is a lesser option but then claim they would love an adopted child equally. How am I lacking compassion here? I want people who are in a position to have children to treat adoption s more than a last resort because they aren't the only ones suffering and are clearly in a position to help someone who is suffering. It is selfish to despair over a problem that can be solved by helping someone in need. 

And yes, contrary to what these people thought of me, I HAVE been deprived of things that were extremely important to me. And I will probably have fertility issues due to medication. ",[deleted],1,YTA,0.0,,1
2420,"AITA for not warming up to my bf's new friend until I found out she was a lesbian?   

My bf Ben is one of those ""never met a stranger"" people. He’s  friendly, outgoing and makes friends easily and often. We live in a big city and he is probably the only person who knows all his neighbors by name and something about them. Ben has a lot of interests and meets new people (men and women) through these and ends up being friends with them and inviting them to other things. I don't really mind but it’s annoying when it’s a female bc there have been instances in the past where they get crushes on Ben and, although I trust him, I would rather not have some chick flirting with my bf (he doesn’t flirt back and usually stops inviting those girls or tries to fix them up with a friend). This past spring Ben met Leah through a running group. She was new to town, in a similar industry as Ben and they have tons in common. Ben invited her to trivia night. Leah is not only beautiful but she's funny, athletic and interesting. While I wasn't cold or mean to her I didn't seek her out in conversation and always held her at arm’s length. Turns out they are training for the same marathon so she also joined his long run group. Leah fit in with our friend group so she is around often. Since she and Ben are in the same industry, she's also at some networking things, too. I was getting tired of her being around all the time and a little insecure bc they have so much in common but they've never done or said anything that makes me suspicious. I've even glanced at their text exchanges (Ben asked me to look up an address she had sent in a text so I wasn't snooping) and there is nothing flirty or inappropriate. He's mentioned before that it doesn't seem like I like Leah and I've always denied it and said we just don't have a lot in common or I was busy talking to someone else. 

Well, a couple weeks ago Leah shows up with Jill and introduces her as her girlfriend. Ben says something like ""oh, its so nice to finally meet you"" indicating he'd known Leah was a lesbian. I won't lie- I felt a huge weight lifted off me and had more fun that night than since Leah joined our group. Ever since then I've talked to her more and found  I really like her. The other day, someone made a joke about how I was an asshole until I found out Leah was a lesbian and not going to steal Ben away. Leah laughed it off but Ben looked a little bothered and asked me later if that was true. I admitted that her being a lesbian made me more comfortable with their friendship. He was upset with me and thought that showed a lack of trust and faith in him. I told him that he knew I wasn't totally comfortable with their friendship and it would've been nice of him to tell me she was a lesbian. He said that he had just found out about two weeks before I did and that it wasn't his place to ""out"" her to me and he thought I didn't like her for something else, not bc I was jealous.

2424,"AITA for being upset that my husband put my presents out early? I'm prepared to accept that IATA because just reading the title I feel hideously spoiled.

Context: I am currently 8months pregnant with our second child, and generally feeling emotional. We have struggled financially for years and this is our first Christmas in our OWN house. Previously we have lived with one set of our parents and spent Christmas with them.

I do not request or expect gifts. My wishlist items this year included an $8 lotion, a $20 book, some special panties you wear after a c-section. It's not about WHAT the gifts are, is my point. But as we usually spend Christmas with my parents, we've done my family's traditions. And it has always been special to me that my parents make presents ""appear as if from nowhere"" on Christmas morning. My mom would wrap olives and that would be a present...it's just special that I wake up and they're there! This is Christmas ""magic"" to me. My husband knows this and always waited until I was in our bedroom to out presents out for me. Even when we were at his parent's house. I seriously don't care what the presents are....I just don't want to see them until Christmas morning. I like even the wrapping paper/shape to be a total surprise. 

Anyway, this year my Christmas traditions have really taken a hit. I wanted my parents to spend the night with us, he said no. I wanted them to come over and see our son open presents, he again said no because it's our first year in our house by ourselves and he wanted it to be just the three of us. I'm very attached to my parents and wanted to experience Christmas with them, but I understood where he was coming from and accepted it. Basically the one tradition I was still expecting was the ""presents as if from nowhere"" thing. He kept them hidden from me up until tonight, Christmas Eve. 

I read our son a bedtime story and came into the living room and there were all of my presents under the tree. Wrapped, to be clear. I just went straight to our room and laid down. I was planning to stay up and watch TV but now didn't want to with the presents out. He came in and started asking why I was upset, I told him calmly but sadly that it was seeing the presents. I didn't want to fight and could tell he was immediately annoyed, so I just didn't want to say anything after that. He kept pressing me, said he was ready for bed, ""when did you expect me to do it"", said he was going to bed, and kept asking me what else I thought he should have done. I stayed quiet until he kept hounding me and I finally said that he could have warned me/waited for me to finish reading/told me the game plan/told me he was ready for bed. And that yes now I was upset. He said ""you know santa isn't real"" and stormed off and said ""what a way to spend Christmas Eve"". Then we both set out the presents for our son and went to bed.

2439,"AITAH for taking my router and cable boxes that are in my name? First time poster on this particular subreddit so hi! 

So I recently moved from my previous place near my old university (I had graduated a few years ago) to a place back in my hometown. However moving was a hassle and every single bill was in my name. This included the internet/cable bill. 

My roommate was nice but foreign, so we didn’t talk much but we were in friendly terms. However I was moving two weeks before she was planning on leaving and she has summer online classes much like I didn’t. Because different towns have different internet providers, I couldn’t simply take and use the internet’s equipment to my new place. I had to return it.

I tried to be fair because my roommate did still need the internet and she paid half the bill, but I didn’t trust her to return the equipment. After all even if she said she would, she could very easily had left it in there and because it was in my name only, I would have been stuck with replacing a router/modem and two cable boxes that would have costed me thousands of dollars because the internet company is ruthless. I mentioned he situation to her, and she had the nerve to ask if one of my friends who still lived in the town could take it for me. I was applaud by that suggestion because it’s not my friend’s responsibility to take it back, it’s mine and I realized I couldn’t really trust here than, even if she said she would mail it back. 

During the time I was moving, I had to keep returning to my old place because I needed to grab the last of my things. So while I was the apartment for the very last time, I texted her since she wasn’t there at the apartment at the time. My mom, who was helping me move, kept saying “take the equipment back. She’s gonna leave it. You can’t trust people anyone. It wouldn’t hurt her if it gets left behind. It would only hurt you. Look out for yourself.” 

So I unscrewed the modem from the cord, packed everything and left, texting her an hour later that I needed to return the internet modem and cable boxes. 

She got mad because now she was without internet. Yes I feel like an asshole but I also feel like I’m in the right because I shouldn’t have to risk her not doing what she said she would do. Now I’m “the worst person ever on earth” because now she can’t do her homework online.

Towards the end of our conversation we started to get to the “secrets” I mentioned something along the lines that I smoked weed for the first time and did various other substances (This was hard for me to tell because my whole life I was pretty much anti-drugs and such.) We both laughed about it saying “Just don’t let mom find out” The joke died out after a little bit and then he just blurted out “I cheated on my wife...” At first it didn’t register until I saw his face and he was dead serious.

He told me they were going through a tough time back then lots of arguing, not communicating, and that he felt really lonely. During this same time my brother met a girl at his local gym, started off as friends, slowly kept bonding and you guessed they did the sex. He told me this occasion only happened once and pretty much cut her off after that night because he started to feel guilty for a short while.

My heart tells me I have to tell her because it’s the right thing to do, especially because I’ve known my brother to cheat one other time on an ex-girlfriend couple years before his current wife. My brain tells me it’s none of my business and I should keep my mouth shut. I don’t want to see their kid go throughout that kind pain either.

2459,"AITA for calling people monkeys? So. Rather than calling people idiots or retards, I call them monkeys. This is simply due to the amount of hate I got for so long calling people retards when they would do something dumb. 

I never meant anything bad by it but it was just like “Oh you fucked up? You retard.” But so many people continued to give me a bunch of hate for calling people retards because it’s “offensive to those with special needs”. 

So after a while of censoring myself from calling people retards, I went through probably a 100 different ways of calling people retards in an effort to not offend someone. The reason by the way that I don’t just say “you idiot” or “you dumbass” is a mixture of reasons. For one, calling someone an idiot isn’t “satisfying”. It’s so plain and boring to me and doesn’t sound like the person really messed up. I also stray away from dumbass because I don’t want to curse at people all the time. 

Thus far the only word that’s given the amount of meaning and satisfaction when said is “you monkey”. I came to this from watching videos on youtube and seeing that monkeys aren’t the brightest of creatures. They throw poop and are very “wild” animals. They don’t do many things with much intelligence, and are (to my knowledge) one of the more dumber species compared to humans, gorillas, apes, chimps, orangutans etc. 

In the last few months however, I’ve started to get called a racist for calling people monkeys. The most common reason is that it was a derogatory term used to demean African-Americans. The second most common is that members of the KKK call African-Americans monkeys even today. 

Thus my question: Is it okay that I call people monkeys when they do or say something stupid?

TLDR: I call people monkeys when they make a fuckup. I do it because it’s a satisfying word to call someone when they mess up because it’s just a simple “You monkey.” - Much more powerful than calling someone a dumbass or idiot because monkeys aren’t in the slightest bright animals.

2460,"AITA for ignoring a couple after they ate all our Bananas? My (29F) partner (30M) and I recently purchased our first home and decided to commemorate with a housewarming party.

Scrolling through Facebook I decided to invite an old friend, Jane, who I hadn't seen in years but had recently reconnected with on Instagram.

She showed up with her ""friend"" Joe, which yeah sure that is fine. I did say bring whoever, the more the merrier.

From the outset they were both being very full on. I assumed it was a combination of nerves, not knowing many people, and feeling a bit awkward.

They proceeded to drink a lot quite quickly, Joe cut his hand on a knife in the kitchen ""playing a knife game."" I suggest they move to the living room.

Happy with them out of the kitchen, I went about checking in on everyone, putting out snacks, and generally being a good host.

When I checked in again, Jane and Joe had taken some Bananas from the fruit bowl and said ""sorry, we are eating your Bananas."" I thought it was a little weird but thought, hey whatever, the other food obviously wasn't to their liking.

**Edit: they did also eat some of the other food. But seemed more interested in the bananas.** 

Well the music was also obviously not to their liking, as Joe insisted on playing his own music loudly on his phone speakers.

Joe seemed ready to mingle but Jane was more interested in sucking face so I left them to themselves with their crackly phone music.

I was tidying some things up, and looked over to see if they were okay and they were sitting on the couch... EATING MORE BANANAS!

Filled with dread, I looked to the fruit bowl and sure enough... Banana-less. 

I don't know what it was about them eating all the Bananas, but something snapped in my mind and I just thought ""fuck this"" and went outside to sit with my other guests.

I didn't go and talk to them after that. They eventually popped their head out to say they were leaving. I gave them a kinda brusque ""bye, thanks for coming."" 

After they left I was like ""I can't believe they ate ALL my bananas!"" Another guest called me on it saying it was a bit uncalled for. 

At the time I was so filled with rage over the Bananas, but in the cold, sober light of day I wonder if the way I acted was a bit rude and asshole-y.

We're both freshman in high school and he has no friends and talks to nobody.  Nobody hates him or anything like that but he is pretty weird.  Well of course I'm the only girl he remotely knows so that's why he asked me.  He made a sign, and came and rang my doorbell.  In the heat of the moment I said yes, because my parents were there.

I'm gonna rewrite this as short and sweet as I can


A few months ago I lost my best friend after a long and close relationship, over..I dont even know..so I'll go over a timeline of sorts.  (Names changed for privacy)
___________
- Me and best friend(Bill) belong to an outfit of friends, important ones that'll come up later will be Pablo, Wilson, Tony, and Ike. Just like every other friend group we like to make fun of eachother, brutally. Over race, weight, social skills, etc.  

- Bill and I are playing something on Xbox when I leave to go grab something and take a bit longer than expected.   

- I come back to find Bill has left the game and is now in a party and playing with Tony and Ike. Tony's okay, but Ike is someone both of us dont like tbh, we tolerate him cos he's Pablo and Wilson's friend.   

- Sent a message to Bill ""You ditched me for a Mexican and a wannabe fuckboi?"". Got a message back ""At least Tony and this bitch aren't breathing all heavy in my ear, ya fatass"" Laugh it off, continue life.  

**2 WEEKS LATER**   

- Some shit goes down and me and Bill are excommunicated from the group.   

**4 MONTHS LATER**   

- Get text from Wilson ""That sneak dis tho"", ask for clarification, he sends a screencap of the aforementioned messages between me and Bill. Text back ""Well, Tony IS Mexican and not really, cos I've called Ike that plenty of times"" also ""Why do you have access to a private convo between me and Bill?"", says he used to watch Netflix with Bill's account.    

- Text Bill and tell him the situation and that maybe he should change his password.  

**2 WEEKS LATER**   

- Go out on the town with Bill, he drops me off and I get a text from Pablo (in the Xbox App) ""That sneak dis tho"", text back ""what? The Mexican, wannabe fuckboi thing"" get a text back ""Sorry, you must have the wrong account"". Realized I got baited for a vulgarity report.  

- Not long after I get a text from Ike, ""fuck you u fat stupid bitch dont be talkin shit bout me cuz I have friends that u dont. Fuck u fatboy""  

- Microsoft must've been hungry cos they jumped on that shit within hours, like it was the last piece of pizza on the pan. I get a 2 week suspension for racial insensitivity and cyberbullying.  

- Call support and explain that these people used to be my friends and we did this all the time, and they just baited me for a report out of context. They tell me a suspension needs to be on record for this but for some unknown reason it gets knocked down to a 2 day suspension. Feeling a bit sour I also whisper in their ear shout a truly vulgar message I got from somebody just a few hours ago. I know they aren't gonna do anything about it, buy I felt better telling them and imagining that they would. Finally, text Bill the situation and go to bed.  

- Next day Bill comes over with something I left in his car, and pulls me into the hall, he says ""lose my number and dont talk to me anymore, I dont want to be friends with someone like you""  

- break down in the hall as my mom texts Bill and asks him why. Bill says he thinks I'm a bad person, and an asshole. I text Bill and ask for an explanation, Bill says I'm a shitty person, I should've just let it go, and I should've never talked shit about them behind their backs. Even though he did too all the time, when we were all friends and we weren't. Because we all knew we did, and none of us gave a shit. And none of us ever said anything we wouldnt say to their face.  

**A WEEK LATER**   

- Text Wilson about the whole situation cos me and him, out of everyone, are still kinda ""good"" or neutral at least, and come to learn that Bill went behind my back about a month after our excommunication and made amends with all them and started hanging out in secret. I wouldnt have given a shit, but I at least would've liked to be told that he was tryna make things right with them.

She's an alcoholic, but is so positive and upbeat. My step dad passed away June 2018 from cancer. He's been in my life for more than half of it, Idk my bio dad irl. My mom went through some rough shit with that. They had JUST moved down south when he was diagnosed, so she never had any familial support, or friends really. Her whole existence was caring for my step dad. Him and I didn't really get along when I was growing up, I moved out at 16. He was also an alcoholic, but mean. As I grew older and didn't have rely on them, the three of us we're able to mend our relationship, to a point, and have good memories. I would never wish pancreatic cancer on my worst enemy. Watching him go through that really changed my perspective on all of my relationships, and how I handle conflict. 

My mom said she was going to stay down south, much to me and my family's grumblings (we're in NY). About 4months after his death, mom starts talking about these new drinking buddies. Slowly she starts talking more about this guy Randy. 

Side story: when I was 10 I asked Mom for my bio dad's name. Panicking, she told me a random name. ""Randy"". I've never met a Randy my whole life. So from 10-18 I believed my bio dad's name was Randy. And then my 18th birthday comes and my mom gives me two (real) names that could be my bio dad, so I can find him if I ever wanted to (I did, haven't met). So 10-18 years old I truly believed my dad's name out there was Randy. The day I found out it wasn't, I think traumatized me more than my mom realized...

So of course I was like wtf universe. Well, over the last couple months mom has stopped going to counseling, she is day drinking, and any time I ask her what she's up to it's always oh we're going to Randy's show (he's an open mic-er) or Randy's cooking dinner (I think he's living in her apartment), it's ALL about Randy. She's not doing stuff for HER. She hasn't unpacked boxes or done important paper work regarding my step dad's death. She's not eating healthy and is drinking/high 100% of the time when she's not working. She has some money from my step dad's death and I'm afraid this guy is using her. He's younger than her. Idk you guys can tell me if I'm an asshole making assumptions too. 

ANYWAYS. Recently I've been getting on my streaming accounts and seeing that stuff I KNOW my mom wouldn't watch is in my ""keep watching"". I pay for Hulu and Netflix (she pays for the HBO add on).

I gave my brother the old one to use with his (my old) PS4. I am in education and at the time I was just starting at a new college.

Since the headset he destroyed was old and cheap I was only a little annoyed and forgave him. A week later I offered him my new headset that I had bought since I had barely used it. I told him that he needs to take care of it and not chew it this time. I also told him I would take it off of him if he did it again. Also, as a kind of deterrent, I told him he would have to pay me the money it costs if I caught him chewing this new headset (£50)

I've been in a lot of medical facilities lately since I'm pregnant and about to pop and I like to chat up the people I interact with.

I (52m) paid to send my stay-at-home DIL (25f) to live in another country with her friends (23f, 25f) to relieve tensions in our relationship I don't use reddit but my wife (46f) told me to post on here to get some perspective on my actions. To give you some background I recently married into this family about 7 months ago but we have all known each other for years through work, I am the CFO of a moderately-sized tech company and my wife's late husband was our COO so we kept a close working and social relationship. He passed about almost a year and a half ago and while I had no intentions, I acted as a support for my now-wife in a friendship that quickly turned into an intimate relationship. She means the world to me but that brings me to where I may have made a mistake, my step-daughter (25f)

My step-daughter is in an art collective with her friends G (27m) S (23f) and H (25f) and they all make disturbing and upsetting art while our bank accounts subsidize it. The only play of hers I ever attended involved a family sitting at a table and everyone except the father slowly undressing, smearing food all over each other, and miming the performance of lewd acts on each other. I had not wanted to talk about it but the entire ride home she kept going on and on about how it was a radical marxist takedown of the patriarch and the way he corrupts the bonds of family. Honestly I can't help but feel that was a bit pointed at me, and her behavior as time has gone on has only increased my suspicions that she harbors some resentment towards me.

She refuses to talk to me and if she does it's an invitation to one of her shows that I politely decline telling her that while I support her art it makes me uncomfortable and anxious to attend. Eventually things boiled over when she invited me to a play her collective puts on in the fall and as usual I politely turned down her offer. But she began screaming that I wasn't her real dad and no amount of money I gave her could change that, this set me off and I told her if I was her dad I wouldn't let her waste away her life just living at home like she does. She fired back saying it's not even a home to her, her girlfriend (22f) broke up with her, and she has nothing left in this city so may as well leave. I told her that I think that actually might be good idea, hell I would pay to have her and her friends to live away for some time. We quieted down and that's how we decided to send her, S, and H to England.

Now I know I fucked up because I agreed to this without consulting my wife and she is livid that this is just an out-of-sight solution.

I told him it was Bulgarian, and then added, ""Excuse my language, but Bergersen has a huge hard-on for Bulgarian.""

I explained to her that I'm kind of an old-fashioned guy, and when I'm around women I try to watch what words I use, mainly because I don't want them to think less of me for it. I haven't known her as long as I have the other guys, so I still wasn't sure how she felt about vulgarity and I thought I'd play it safe. That explanation seemed to only make her more upset.

Now, for some context, back then it was still a ""You should be 18 to go to fires"" but with such a small town, such a small brigade, they were happy to let us more mature older kids on a truck at 16. This is important because we were still at High School at this point.

Anyway, 2300-ish hours our pagers go off, we race down to the fire shed, we jump in the trucks and head out to this house fire. All good so far.

We get the fire out fairly quickly, but it completely fucked the house, now being curious, we then started doing a bit if a check to what started it.

A fucking hydro setup.

An entire bedroom of the house was a hydro pot farm, it was all fairly well roasted by the time we got there (bit of a shame)

Anyway, local copper who was there (In Footy Shorts and a Singlet) goes and grabs his handcuffs and arrests dad who promptly fessed up to it all on the spot. He knew he was caught.

Anyway, fast forward 2 days to a school assembly and they wanted to start a fundraiser for the girls who ""Lost everything in a mysterious fire of which the cause is unknown"",at which point I yelled out ""Bullshit, their dad was growing drugs and that burnt the house down""

Promptly got pulled out of the assembly and reprimanded saying I ""Can't start rumours like that"" despite the fact I'd literally been there, seen it, and heard the confession from the dad.

The title sounds bad but hear me out.

I (m26) have been dating my girlfriend (f26) for 5 years now. We've been living together for 2 and a half years. My gf, let's call her Amber, has OCD. (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder). In Amber's case it means that she has to keep everything clean and organized. So that's what she does in our apartment. I of course help at cleaning too, she doesn't do it all by herself.

I've always been very understanding and supportive of Amber and her illness. She also has many friends who know about her disorder and have been helpful and supportive for years.

So last night one of Amber's best friends (We'll call her Fiona) invited us to her home to dinner with her boyfriend (Nyle). 

Fiona and Nyle are really good friends of Amber. They know about her OCD. They are very understanding and want to learn more about it so it's been a topic for many conversations before. However we weren't talking about it at the moment. We were having a conversation about living together and how Fiona was planning on moving in with her Nyle. 

So we finished our main courses and Fiona and Amber went to the kitchen to prepare the dessert. Me and Nyle were still talking. So Nyle asked something along the lines of ""What's it like to live with Amber?"" and I said ""Well, you know, at least I don't have to clean anything up myself."" And we laughed a bit and continued the conversation.

When we came home Amber told me that she heard my joke from the kitchen. I asked what she meant and she told me how she heard me tell Nyle how I don't have to clean and it really offended her. I told her that I'm sorry she flet that way but It was just a harmless joke. She said something about the joke making her feel like her OCD was a way for me to get away from cleaning and that it sounded like I was ""taking advantage"" of her disability.

I told her that's not true and it's ridiculous how she can be mad over a little joke but she is really mad at me and won't talk to me at all.

So, reddit, am I the asshole for making a harmless joke?

2487,"AITA: Girlfriend lied to me, and she’s upset at me for getting upset Using a throwaway because obvious reasons.

My girlfriend and I decided to do a diet together. I’ve wanted to lose some weight for some time and she wanted to join me to eat healthier and support me. I could tell she was kind of skeptical of the diet and probably wouldn’t make it the whole 30 days on it. She seemed grossly underprepared to do it and hasn’t even read about it before the day of. I’ve done the diet a few times before and know how to navigate and plan well for it.

We started a couple weeks ago. All was going well one week in. We went out to dinner at a restaurant that complied with the diet- she found it and ate the food there and everything.

Then last Saturday, we were heading to my brothers for game night. I picked her up. While I was waiting for her to finish getting ready, I hung out with her roommate. He was making food and offered me some that was breaking the diet and that she had eaten some.

So I went upstairs and asked her if she ate one. She told me no. She lied right to my face. When we went back down, her roommate pulled her aside. I can only guess she figured out I knew because she came running out to me and said “Please let me explain!” I was fuming at her lying so easily to me that I just kept walking.

We got in the car and she was crying but I kept ignoring her. Halfway there, she asked to be dropped off and said she didn’t want to go. I told her we couldn’t play the games unless she came and she was going to ruin the whole night for everyone because she was upset that she got caught lying.

She told me she was going to tell me that night after games. I asked her if she had even accomplished any days in the diet and she said she made it into the second day and got faint at work. She said she almost passed out and her coworkers had to feed her stuff that was breaking the diet. She said she can’t afford to pass out at work (she’s a teacher) but she could just find other recipes on the diet to do or put in more effort to make it work. And now her coworkers all think I’m a jerk.

I was so livid about that, about her lying right to my face, and about her reason for not telling me. She said she was worried I’d be upset (I’m upset that she LIED but I wouldn’t have been upset that she stopped the diet) and that she wanted to be supportive of my diet and let me get through the first few days of it before she told me she wasn’t doing it. She said she was also worried we would fight about it so she wanted to wait until we had a discussion on a weekend night instead of a work day. She swears she was going to tell me that night.

I dropped her off after game night and told her I’d let her know when I wanted to talk. I texted her the next day that I loved her. She wrote back that my reaction was concerning to her.

2498,"AITA for asking my husband to stop looking at porn? (NSFW) Some background:

&#x200B;

I consider myself (31F) to have a high libido, but my husband's (31M) is even higher.  We do the nasty quite often, but I can understand that even with a lot of sex, you might need some alone time.  I don't mind that he looks at porn and jacks off.  I do notice on the days that he does, which are only when I'm working (M-Th), he is less interested in sex with me.  He still is excited and willing, but I will be the one initiating.  I've pointed this out to him and we recognize that this dynamic is great.  We usually (95% of the time) both get what we want.

&#x200B;

Current situation:

&#x200B;

I am pregnant and my hormones are off the chart.  I am so horny that I've begun sexting him and masturbating while on my break at work, which I have never done before.  Every time I see my husband I am ready to rip his clothes off and make him cum (to which he always reciprocates).  This extreme incline in my libido has left me wanting, because while we do have sex pretty much as often as possible, the craving is still there.  Now, like I said, on days that he had jerked off, especially on days where he did it right before I got home from work, or if he did it before I woke up (he works a morning shift and I usually get home after dinner), he would be almost completely uninterested in me.  Noticing this, I asked that he take a break from porn, at least until this subsides (which, since I'm entering my 2nd trimester, might be kinda soon).  His reaction to this request was kind of strange, but understandable.  He said that even though sex is more fun, masturbating is easier (true), and it's hard to wait around until I get home, especially since it hasn't really been a problem before and it's something he's used to just doing when he wants (understandable), and that to completely stop would be a challenge for him (this is where I am questioning myself).  However, he would try.

It has been about 2 weeks, and they have been AMAZING (edit: for both of us)!  On top of having some really great escapades, the intimacy is nice.  He has admitted to me (because I was able to tell) that he's masturbated twice since I've asked him to ""save himself"" all for me.  I can also tell that this is not ideal for him.  Even with how much we've bonded these last couple of weeks, he would prefer to do things as they were before, rather than how I have asked (He hasn't said this explicitly, but  with him there is truth in all sarcasm, so I know what his true opinion is).

&#x200B;

So my questions are:

&#x200B;

AITA for asking this of him?  Am I being selfish?  I've never really been all that intrigued by porn, so even though I understand the appeal, I definitely don't ""need"" it.  Is his ""need"" normal for most guys?  I've only ever had short term relationships before meeting him, so this kind of issue is not something I've discussed and I need an outside opinion.

Would I be the asshole for asking for this to continue, just to see how it would go even if my sex drive drops off a bit?

I have not been happy about this, and I've expressed that to roommate 1 multiple times but the dog is still over 3-5 nights a week and has been for the last 8 or so months. I realized I am fighting a losing battle, and to keep the peace between the three of us I have not really brought it up.  Keep in mind we have NOT paid a pet deposit, nor do I want to contribute to one.

A few weeks ago Roommate 2 moves out due to a job relocation. We posted another ad on craigslist, and find Roommate 3. Roommate 3 is a pretty cool dude, and we all gel well so we have him take over the lease for Roommate 2. Well, come to find out he has a dog that he wants to bring over to the house too. Roommate 1 is all for this as obviously he has a dog, where I am very very hesitant. I told roommate 3 that I really don't want pets in the house, but roommate 1 had already told him the dog would be fine. So the dog comes over, it's a pit bull mix, and checks every box of what I do NOT want to live with. Immediately jumps all over the sofas, starts running around on the carpet and ripping it up with his claws, starts barking, etc. He is aggressive too, and as I was walking upstairs last night jumped up and nipped at my hand for no reason. Roommate 1 and his girlfriend love the dog, love that their dog gets along with it, and were really happy that roommate 3 brought the dog with him. I am absolutely LIVID that this is happening. It's everything I did NOT want to live with but now I am the odd man out here.

I am basically considering asking roommate 1 and roommate 3 to find another option at the end of the month if this keeps up. I know that bringing this up is going to upset them, and they really are good roommates otherwise.

So, AITA?



1.  They stop bringing the dogs over completely.  If they DO need to come over, they need to stay out of the house.  End of discussion.

2.  They inform the landlords that they have dogs, and will need to put a pet deposit down for each of them.  I will then begin the process of terminating my lease and finding a new place to live on my own terms (AND NOT LET THIS HAPPEN AGAIN!!!)

3.   They both find a new living situation where pets are allowed, and I stay at the same house.

If none of these seem to go over well then I will contact the rental agency and see what can be done to get them off the lease.  I feel like those three options are very reasonable, and equally inconvenience both of us.","I'm going very against the grain here.  


YTA - not because you don't want to live with pets.

For some context here: my boyfriend has been separated (but not divorced) from his wife for about 9 years now.
They’re on good terms now and she says she doesn’t care what happens to the dress and neither does he. 

I like to sew and repurpose fabric to make things and the wedding dress has really interesting fabric and beautiful red embroidery on the bust and I’m really interested in what I can make from it.

2515,"AITA for not letting my ex-wife see our dog before I put him down? Yesterday was a hard day. I not only had to make the choice to let my best friend go but I’m also dealing with my hell of an ex who is relentlessly berating me over text, bad mouthing me on Facebook, and telling our daughter horrible things about me saying she’s going to take me to court for full custody because I’m an “evil bastard with zero emotional capacity for anyone but myself.” 

I’ve had Cooper for 12 years. He was my dog before I met my ex, while we were married, and for two years after we split. He is my dog in every sense of the word in that I’m the one who chose him from the litter and raised him as a puppy, and I’m the one who fought to keep him after the divorce. I took care of him while we were married, walking him, taking him with me to work, feeding him, etc... granted my wife loved him, but to her he was just something nice in the background while he was my best friend. When we had our daughter, she even pushed Coop further into the background insisting that he be kept locked in the kitchen while the baby was out as well as in the evening when he was use to sleeping with us on the bed. 

After our divorce she pretended to care for a little while, taking him for a few days while she had custody of our daughter “so my daughter could be with him.” But over the last year it stopped completely. Our daughter is almost a teenager now and  couldn’t care less about him and my ex ultimately decided that in his old age he was more of pain in the ass than nice to have around. 

Over the last 6 months his health drastically declined. It was harder for him to want to get up and move, he lost all his spunk, had trouble controlling his bladder and over the last month only ate sparingly. I knew I had to make the call when he refused to eat the past two days, even when I gave him wet food. 

Due towork and other things going on for me I made the arrangements to have him put down yesterday. My ex had to work that day, my daughter was at school but knew it was likely going to happen and I had to get it done before I left today for work. I texted my ex and daughter when I was at the vet to let them know what was happening and my ex absolutely lost it. She told me to hold off, telling me she wanted to get our daughter and come say goodbye. This woman hasn’t even SEEN our dog in the last 8 mos. I was at the vet, he was on the table ready to go and I couldn’t wait an hour for her to leave work, drive to our daughters school and drive into town to come say goodbye to him. So now I am now the most self centered heartless bastard to ever walk the earth and now my daughter won’t even talk to me because of all the hatred her mother is spewing to inflict emotion. My daughter is now saying she wants to go live with her mom despite the fact that I have 50/50 custody and she knew what was happening.  AITA here?

A couple of times, however, I’ve inboxed her and she’ll open the message and just ignore it, then the next day she’ll either apologise and continue the conversation or not even acknowledge the fact she’s ignored me for a day. At first I thought this was a bit weird but I never questioned it, until it happened a couple more times and I noticed a pattern.


Because of work schedules and locations and resources, she doesn’t live with her boyfriend. When she has the next day off, she’ll go straight to her boyfriend’s from work, then spend the night and next day there. This is when she ignores my messages.


I get really socially anxious so I always fear that people don’t actually like me and that I’m just being a pest but she told one of our colleagues that we’re “besties” (cringe) and she seeks me out at work when we’re not in the same area. She also inboxes me first now (originally I’d always open the conversation). This was a relief to me as I originally thought she didn’t actually like me and I was just being an annoyance. So that ruled out why I originally thought she was ignoring me.


I asked her why she ignores me and she said sometimes she opens the message, then forgets to reply and loses the notification.

I’ve been friends with Amy for four years. A year ago I got a puppy, and he’s now a mid-size pup who comes to roughly vagina-level on most 5’4”~ folks. 

Amy always says she loves dogs, but she only has small chihuahuas. Whenever Amy comes over, my dog gets excited since she has pups of her own he can smell, and usually will try to sniff her vagina. I always tell him to stop and I apologize, but Amy gets pretty huffy about that, as well as when he tries to lick her hand when she pets him. I think these are pretty normal dog things, but it’s important to me he’s well trained, so I try to take it in stride and teach him others’ expectations as well. 

Yesterday Amy asked to hangout because she was super hungover. She got drunk and took some guy home from the bar. I asked if she wanted to go to her place since my SO was out and I’d be on dog duty while we hungout. She said my place was better cause she wanted to “vent” about the guy and not be near her roommates. 
She comes over and Pup reliably zeroes in on her vagina. Amy two-hand shoved my dog out of the way, screaming FUCK OFF!! I got upset and said “Calm down!” She unloaded and told me I need to “train my fucking dog.” 

I got pissed because she knows I have been working really hard with this dog. I said, “Sorry, I forgot that it’s repulsive when a dog does it but not when some random bro is fingering you in an Uber.” She said I’m slut-shaming her and left.

Hi y’all I’m posting on behalf of my boyfriend (M25) and the situation with his room mate (M23). Here are his words: 

A brief background- I moved into an apartment with 2 of my friends. As part of our lease specials, we got a garage spot for free. It’s normally $250. We live in a big city in the north, so sometimes finding parking can take 10-15 minutes of driving around the neighborhood. Needless to say, the attached spot is amazing!  When I lived alone, I didn’t get a spot at my old place as I didn’t want to pay an extra $150 for it, so i suffered with street parking. 

Now when we moved in, I was the only one with a car so I took the spot. Now one of my roommates is getting a car and wants a spot in the garage. This will add a $250 charge. Now my roommate is talking about getting a second spot and having both of us split it as my spot is free. Idk if that’s something I want to do, as him getting a car shouldn’t add to my expenses. Would I be the asshole for refusing to help pay for his spot?

Edit: I asked for some clarifying details to answer  questions from the comments. 

1) The car is not allocated to the unit, the spot is assigned to his car specifically using his license plate number. 

2) the cost of the spot is not part of the rent. It was for a rent promotion. Once the first lease term is up my bf will have to pay for the parking space he currently occupies.

Edit 2: apparently this room mate doesn’t even have a license so I’m not really sure how this even came up.",YWBTA. One free parking spot is including with your lease.

It's her birthday next month and the bike she is riding is pretty trashy and the 5 of us decided to buy her a new bike. But those are pretty expensive and I was thinking, is she even going to keep that one good?

In the past, she let my BF hang out with another girl. And she still approves of them as friends very much.


With that as context, his mother is horribly obese. 400 lbs. She wasn't always. Her wedding pictures seem to put her in the 140-170 range. The one friend is of heavier stature. And I am underweight. I am worried for her as she breathes heavily when walking or doing anything minorly tiring and I have no understanding of how someone can double their weight in 20 years. I have always struggled with putting on weight and his mother to me seems to hate me for the fact I have the body she can't. 


My dad, a pretty wise and socially educated guy has expressed that some women feel that way. That I'm the girl she hated in high school. I really hate posting this because it seems like Im fat shaming this woman (reminder that my boyfriend is half of this woman, for thought) and that really is not what im trying to do. 


Am I the asshole for going and assuming that she is thinking maliciously of her weight, or am I making a proper assumption. The opinions of people who are/have struggled with weight on both ends of the spectrum will help me a lot here.

2545,"AITA for reporting fraud Throwaway

I'm an audiologist and I do work for the VA. I, personally, feel that hearing loss claims are ones that fraudsters erroneously select the most thinking they can just ignore the beeps and get some quick cash. 

This guy comes in with a claim for hearing loss. Now, to be clear, you don't need to be deaf to get money from the VA. You can have normal hearing that shows a decline over time and still get a rating. The guy is doing fine. Hearing is looking normal. Then we get to a point and he basically gets everything wrong. So I call bullshit and tell him that his hearing his normal, I know what he's doing and he needs to cut it out so we can finish the test. 

He apologizes, he does look a little nervous, but he says that the small space he's in for the test is triggering a panic attack and that;s why he jacked that part of the test. Guy was a submariner so I'm not buying his claustrophobia excuse.

I note in his record that I think he was being noncompliant with the test and potentially trying to manipulate the results. That's usually all it takes. This guy, however, within a few days of the test withdrew his claim. I suspect he withdrew his claim because I called him out rather than just making a note and he didn't want my accusation to turn into a fraud investigation. 

This kind of pissed me off. I'm tired of people trying to cheat the system. My BIL is a VA Special Agent so I called him to tip him off to this guy. He tells me that it isn't going to go anywhere because 1) the guy withdrew his claim and 2) proving he tanked his test, or tried to, would be somewhat difficult as his lawyer would almost certain argue he actually did have a panic attack since the rest of the test was perfectly normal participation. He suggested I just let it go.

I chose not to.

The guy is employed as a police officer. So I called the misconduct tip line for his department and basically laid out that he was trying to cheat a compensation exam. An investigator contacted me and thanked me for my tip and said they may need to subpoena some records if they find enough to warrant more investigation.

My BIL is telling me that I fucked up big and I shouldn't have done basically any of the things I've done aside from making the note in my report. From my standpoint, if more people stepped up and actually vigorously pursued fraudsters then there would be less fraud.

What do you guys think, AITA?","YTA. Aren't people who worked in submarines more prone to claustrophobia? I feel like you are basing this off of speculation and misjudgments.

2549,"AITA for telling my roommate to leave? I currently live in a 2BR apartment with one roommate. I am the leaseholder, and we have a verbal month to month agreement. She first moved here back in December, and told me that she was only looking for a place until May or June, at which point she would be moving out of the country entirely. This sounded great to me, since summertime is when the most people are looking to move in my area. The area makes a lot of sense for students (I'm also a student), who are usually moving around July-September.


Things have been okay up until recently. I've only talked to her in person a handful of times since she's lived here because our work schedules never aligned and she would always just go straight to her room when she got home, but our conversations were pleasant enough. She's clean and respectful enough too, although there have been a lot of little things that bother me that are hard to bring up when you never see this person around. She pays rent and utilities on time too. So when May and June rolled around with no mention of a move on her part I was surprised but also just kind of went along with it. I probably should have asked what the deal was, but I saw her so infrequently that I didn't bring it up. I also was kind of dreading bringing it up with her, because while she has been nice enough to me, there have been a few very weird, offputting and unexplained things with her, (I can explain more but I'm not sure its that relevant) and I didn't want any of that directed to me.


Well, about three weeks ago I decided that I wanted her to go. I wasn't home at the time, so I texted her asking if she would be home later because I wanted to talk about some things. She responded by saying, ""What is there to talk about? I paid rent this month and my moveout date is end of September."" That date was news to me. I told her that I wanted to talk about the date, and that I didn't think that would work for me. She said ""sorry but I can't move earlier."" I reminded her that she had said she was moving in June, and that as the leaseholder I needed to make the decision that seemed best for me financially. Legally I only have to give her 30 days, but I wanted to give her time so I said I'd like her to be gone by the end of August, and I again asked if we could talk in person. At that point she just said fine I'm moving out end of August, and then told me that she was going to pay the last month with her security deposit. I thanked her for understanding, but I also told her that she couldn't pay rent with her security deposit. At the same time I told her that we could talk about it more and maybe work something out with the deposit, since I knew she might need to put a new deposit down. But I told her that I wasn't willing to take the full financial risk of accepting deposit as rent.

She didn't respond to my text, and I basically had to ambush her when she finally appeared in the kitchen. I asked if she wanted to talk and she just said ""I get it, and I don't want to talk to you"". I said, ""So you understand I expect you to pay rent and I am not accepting your security deposit as rent?"" and she just said ""Yeah, I get it"" and went to her room.

That's pretty much been our last interaction. In the three weeks since that conversation, I've run into her on the street, she pretended not to see me. She also deleted me from her social media. Tonight I had just started brushing my teeth, and she wanted to use the bathroom, I told her she could go if she needed to, since I could brush outside the bathroom, but she just walked away. Afterwards, I was flossing, and she came back and loudly was like ""are you fucking kidding me? you gotta be kidding me?"" and stomped off.

I understand why she's upset and I get that its difficult to find a new place, especially a short term place right before an international move, assuming thats even happening at all anymore. And maybe I could have handled it better and reaffirmed a need for an actual conversation without making these definitive final statements through text. I didn't really intend it to go that way, but she kind of made me mad, it seemed like she was telling me no, this is how its going to be, when I'm the one ultimately responsible for the apartment. It was also colored by an earlier event that day, when I had found out that she had ""installed"" an air conditioner in her room. The lease specifically prohibits them without building approval (to be fair she wouldn't know this), and she also installed it by propping it up on two tin cans. We also split electricity evenly and I felt like that probably changes the equation. I was pretty mad about this and also wanted to talk about that, but it never got to that point after the way the text conversation went.

I feel like maybe I could be the asshole here, but I also feel like I've done my best to be fair to her while doing what I feel is best for myself. I feel like she's being childish about the whole thing, refusing to talk at all and throwing these mini temper tantrums. I also know that she has tons of free time these days, she's basically off for the summer, as far as I can tell she's home all the time now. So when she refused to talk to me about why ""it was impossible"" for her to move before September it just comes across as her being unfair to me. It seems like she's just upset because I put a burden on her summer vacation. So I don't know, am I the asshole?","I'm  going to qualify my response by saying I've been in a similar situation to your roomie but I think you're the asshole here.

I'm not saying this was an inconvenience to me at all: it wasn't. Anyway, when he got there I pointed out the time. He said something like ""yeah, well I'm only a few minutes late, and traffic was bad"" and proceeded to take out the pay machine. I told him something like ""I mean, the policy is the policy dude"". He started explaining to me that if I get the pizza for free, it comes out of his pocket, not the company's. This was news to me and I wasn't quite sure how to take it. I told him that's unfortunate but again, not really on me. At this point he hesitated for a few moments and then says ""Well anyway you have to pay now regardless. Then you call the company afterwards to get your refund."" Something about how unsure he sounded made me really think he was bullshitting me to trick me into paying (sure enough, Googling afterwards revealed this is not a thing). I ignored what he said and told him ""listen dude I'll give you a good tip but I'm not paying for the pizza"". He asked me ""how much is the tip?"" I said ""like $10?"" he said ""okay"" but told me to call up the company and tell them he wasn't actually late and that they should reimburse him. At this point I just wanted to stop dealing with him so I told him yes I would do that, took the pie and gave him $10, and then never called the place.

I'm pretty confident that he's the asshole because he's straight up lying to a customer's face to try to trick me out of my money, but was I also an asshole for insisting in the first place?

TLDR at the bottom

So for the backstory,

My little brother started dating one of my friends. this friend isn't my best or closest friend ever but it is someone that I've known for years. we have inside jokes and we talked a bit. And with his last girlfriend he swore he was still a virgin which later on was said was a lie.

My little brother asked permission to date her. I did appreciate this cause we developed the no friends rule after a previous problem. But when he started to date her he continued the story that he was a virgin and I didn't want it to be awkward that my brother and friend are intimate. I gave permission to my little virgin brother and the innocent kid.

I've ALWAYS been horrible with confrontation. And the other night my brother had mentioned something about her.

id said, ""I really wanna say something but I know its going to be taken wrong.. and..""

My mother had said something like, ""If you think something you have the right to say if if he agrees not to blow up on you.""

I had responded has quickly has i could've said, ""I never agreed to you guys being more than just a couple. i agreed to have little innocent baby brother to be my friends boyfriend. The virgin brother. i never wanted this and if you wanted to be intimate with her you shouldn't have lied about you being a virgin. in order to agree to something i NEED to know ALL the terms of it. it wasn't fair to me that you lied and now you're with MY friend.""

My little brother didn't really have a response in the moment but i found out later from my mother that he was really angry at my opinion and basically that i shouldn't have assumed nothing was gonna happen between them. Mostly that i am wrong. when my mom told me i had that guilt of saying something i shouldn't have but i still whole heartedly believe in. i don't think it was fair to be lied to and I'm not going to make them breakup, but now its really awkward to hear my little brother talk about what they do behind closed doors (my family is mostly open about s\*\*ual things)

TLDR: my little brother is dating my friend and wasn't open with his intentions when he asked if he could date her. so i yelled at him.

I am the one who handles grocery shopping for the household because A) I'm the only one who's not exhausted or working on the weekends, and B) I'm the only one with a car to go to the store with.

I tend to be a cost-conscious shopper, opting to buy in bulk, or buy cheaper. One think I buy in bulk is bottled water, usually 35 or 40 count packs. Obviously, these are extremely heavy, but each pack lasts the household about 2 weeks, and it's cheaper than buying smaller packs every week.

However, I am not a strong person, so I usually need help from a store employee to get the packs into my cart and into my car. B is way stronger than I am, and I often ask his help when I get the big packs of water, or when I have a lot of heavy grocery bags. He used to be fine with helping, but his attitude has changed over the past few months.

""I'm not feeling good. I'll do it later.""
""I'm on the phone. I'll do it later.""
""I was about to shower, I'll do it later.""

Normally I ask R to help after B says no, but she's not always home, so I have to make two or three trips to get all the bags by myself... But the water is still a problem.

We recently had an argument about this. He didn't have a specific reason, but he said he didn't want to help with the bags. I agreed to take care of the bags by myself, but I told him I still need help with the water. I explained to him why I buy such big packs of water, and all he said to that was ""Okay, fine.""

I bought another big pack this past weekend, and told him I need his help. He said he couldn't right now, but he would do it later, so I left it at that. It took him FOUR days of constant reminders and me asking for help before he finally got the water from my car. When he brought it in, he slammed the pack on the floor, then stormed off to our room.

I'm a 25F who doesn't live in the US. In my country 25 is the max age limit a child can receive child support (if said person meet the requirements, which I do. If not, the ""regular"" limit let's put it this way, is 18 years old). I will be doing 26 next week and my father has already started the process to stop the payments on child support.

Due to the course of their divorce, my father got the best out of it and kept the house; since then me and my mother pay rent in a house that is priced inside the child support money we receive. My country is going through a hard recessions and I've been unable to find a stable job (I'm a teacher) and since I don't have a stable job I also couldn't leave home. I have been doing small side jobs to keep going. 

He has an excellent job, one that puts himself among the 10% or so of the population regarding income and life quality. He lives alone with his new wife and the money he pays me makes less than 10% of his income. My mother has a severe heart condition that makes her unable to work and we scrape by using the child support, my small jobs and her retirement funds. Since he has long since remarried, he me that should anything happen to my mother (he knows about her condition) I wouldn't be welcome to go back to his house (which I lived in until the divorce). 

I fear that without the money we will be unable to pay the rent and I have already told him that, and he didn't answer anything. I know that by law he has done his fair share, but am I the asshole for expecting a little understanding and compassion regardless? 

Tl;dr: need the child support money to pay rent and live with sick mother. Father has already paid until the max age supported by law.

Edit: I think my post is not sufficiently clear. I know that he has paid his due. I won't expect him to keep paying. In fact, that's why I won't be contesting his action of withdrawing the support (which I can by the law). I just expected understanding of his part that I'm not in a good financial place now. I wasn't prepared to have the money cut out and to hear that anything should happen, I wouldn't be able to expect anything from him.

Edit 2: the law in my country is COMPLETELY different from those applied in the United States or Europe. Here, even though the max age is 25 for child support on regular cases, there are several cases which older people can apply for child support, such as: extreme poverty, disability or diseases that need special attention or treatment, education (in case the person is still in school and has no means of supporting oneself). Even though I appreciate all the comments, I don't think anyone here knows more about the law in my country than myself.

Some context... I (M34) have a best friend (F33), who’ve I’ve been close with for 14 years. We’ve never had any romantic involvement with each other and we’re solidly in a “love you like a sibling” type friendship. Recently, she got involved with a guy who was cheating on his GF to bang her. She went on about how close they were getting, how much she liked him, how much he liked her, etc. There’s other details that I won’t get into, but suffice to say that, from my perspective, it looked like this guy was playing her for sex. So I told her that. A few times. Fast-forward a few weeks and, surprise-surprise, the guy tells her that he’s staying with his GF and so they break things off. A few other things were happening concurrently with her - her own relationship with her (now ex) BF was falling a part and she had to move back in with her parents, a friend of hers died of cancer (after a year’s long struggle) and she had some weird skin reaction so her face was pretty busted for a number of days. This all culminated in some texts back-and-forth between us and I was breaking her balls about getting involved with some loser and that her face was gross (not my actual words, but you get the idea). It’s important to note that we definitely have a well-established dynamic of ball-breaking and that she had previously complained about her ex-BF for being too sensitive about such things.

I chimed in saying 'Oh that's so weird to see him as anything other than Captain America!'...and they just kinda awkwardly looked at me without a word.) 

Since the beginning of the semester, Roommate A has had her boyfriend (Cam) over nearly every single day, up until visitation hours are over (12 am on weekdays, 2 am on weekends). Cam is very good friends with Roommate B, and if he doesn't come to the dorm with his girlfriend, Roommate B brings him along instead. He even has his own pillow and blanket here and he takes naps on the couch. 

Yesterday, I was in the dorm after working and was getting annoyed as I hear the 3 of them complain about a professor for 30-40 minutes. Right after they finish, I said I needed to talk to them all for a second.

Silence, no reply from any of them until I ask if its ok. A quiet ""sure"" from Roommate A,  so I continue (in a monotone voice) and say that Cam can no longer be here everyday, it bothers me, he is not my roommate. Please have him only come over on Thurs/Fri/Sat/Sun.

Silence again except now Cam just gets up and packs up without a word. I say he can stay since it's already 10pm. He replied in a shaky voice, which surprised me. I think he was mad. He mentioned something about having things to do anyways. Still silence and I had to urge a reply from the others.

Roommate A eventually says ""sure we can figure something out."" Roommate B says nothing still until I address her by name and she snaps back a reply ""he's just my friend I don't really have any say if he's in the room or not.""  She has complained to me about him being there too often and she's tired of it and yet she brings him here.

They all left immediately after that with no more words to me and I just felt so bad and guilty to drive all of them away like that. AITA?","YTA. Sorry, OP.

2569,"AITA because I told my wife's co-worker abortion was probably her best option. So here's the story. My Wife has a co-worker that works at the desk right next to her and they chat throughout the day. Most of the co-workers in her office are much older so they naturally gravitate towards each other. To be honest my wife doesn't really like her co-worker as she is so self absorbed but since there is no one else to really chat with they have become ""friends"".

This has resulted in going out for dinner and drinks a few times with my wife's co-worker and her boyfriend. The guy is a total douche-bag and openly says misogynistic and racist things to my face thinking it was funny. After a few times I told my wife I wasn't comfortable hanging out with him anymore and she was fine with that. Her co worker even seemed to understand because she knows her boyfriend is terrible and talks about leaving him all the time but never does. In the past he has hit her, degraded her, and emotionally abused her son (from a different father).

I have been lucky and haven't had to see or talk to either co-worker or her boyfriend for 5-6 months since I refused to hang out with him. So on Monday my wife and I took the day off for our kids first day of school. It was a great day, kids were excited and after school we took the kids for ice cream. While at ice cream my wife got a text from her co-worker that she needs to talk to her asap. we ran back to our house and her co-worker was in her car parked in our driveway.

When we went inside her co worker was crying hard and told us she was pregnant. She had just told her boyfriend who freaked out and left. She kept going on and on about how angry he was and she has never seen him this mad etc...

My wife was trying to calm her down and talk with her when out of the blue she started to ask me questions like ""You're a guy, would you freak out over finding out your girlfriend was pregnant, would you have stormed out? I told her she shouldn't be thinking about his feelings at all right now. She needs to focus on her self and her son. She should go to her parents and stay there because her boyfriend is unstable and may hurt her or her son. She needs to Immediately end all contact with boyfriend unless its through a third party. I then told her that since she can barely afford to take care of her son and her boyfriend is a deadbeat she should consider aborting her pregnancy. She does not have the financial or emotional resources available to care for a second child and it would force her to be tied to her current boyfriend in some capacity for the next eighteen years.

My wife shot me a horrified look and co worker immediately started yelling at me. I tried to calmly explain my reasoning but it wasn't going over well so I went in the other room. Later after my wife's co-worker left she said I was a total asshole to suggest that. I felt she asked for my advice so I gave it. AITA?

&#x200B;

To clarify a little bit I knew how much of an asshole her boyfriend was first hand as he had blown up at her son at a company picnic over spilling a drink on him and after he left my wifes co worker admitted he sometimes get angry and the bruise she had a month or so back was him. 

Also I can't remember her exact phrasing but while sitting on our couch she had said something to the affect ""I don't think I can raise a baby on my own"" I took this to mean she was already considering abortion but I am an asshole so I might be misinterpreting her.","YTA.  That was a horrible thing to say, and I am pro choice.  Regardless of her political views, a decision like that is a very personal one.

2571,"AITA for being upset my sister & husband spent 5x our agreed-upon budget at Christmas? Heading needs an edit: it’s about my sis & HER husband. :)

My family consists of six adults (myself, my sister, our parents, & both of our husbands. My sister and I each have two small children. 

BACKGROUND: Years ago, we decided that we (the adults) needed to cut back on our increasingly-excessive Christmases.  My sister suggested we start to draw names...each adult buys gift(s) for one family member.  Limit: $150.  We unanimously agreed. We also all agreed Christmas gifts should really be for the kids.  My husband and I had some life-altering expenses that really were making Christmas (& life) difficult.  I was so relieved we had all agreed to this.  This is an indefinite agreement.  We discuss it every year at Thanksgiving. 

Fast-forward a few years after our $150 limit agreement. 

PROBLEM: 
Christmas of 2018: we all stuck to the $150 limit.  Except for my sister’s husband. He spent $900 on my dad (Rolling Stones tickets, etc., etc.).  We were shocked - my dad is a HUGE fan (and it was my idea to perhaps go in on tickets for him at a later date).  I was hurt that my BIL swiped my idea, yes, but it was the blatant disregard for our firm budget that bothered me more. Oh well, I moved on & was happy my dad got to enjoy a great concert. 

Christmas of 2019: it happened again.  This time it was my sister.  She spent at least $800 on my mom. (Nice Apple Watch, and MANY other things). 

I made the mistake of telling my sister that her disregard for the budget made the rest of us feel bad.  Well she was PISSED.  She told me that “we” (she was speaking for both of us to make it more palatable for me, I suppose) don’t do enough to show my parents our appreciation for all we do for them.  It was NOT a nice convo.  She thinks I’m completely unreasonable. 

AITA here?  (My sister & BIL think I’m a nut job for having an issue w/ this.  More info: they only do this when they draw my parents’ names.  Yes, they are very wealthy.)",YTA- these gifts are not for you or from you. It doesn’t sound like anyone has a problem with everyone else sticking to the budget.

2572,"AITA for wanting to paint after my mom cleaned the kitchen and then got mad at her for when she passively aggressively suggested I don’t clean up after myself? I live in a house with my mom, dad, brother, and two pets, so the house is messy sometimes. My mom does most of the cleaning but I always try to help out when I can. My room is my responsibility of course and I’ll also help my mom with favors and I take care of meals sometimes. 

 Anyway, I like to paint and draw. My mom got me some paints for Christmas and I found the box of them in my closet and I kinda wanted to try them out. My room dosent have a place for me to paint. I have a desk, but that has a bunch of electronics on it that I’d have to move and I have carpet so I didn’t want to risk it, so I opted for the kitchen table. I went down without my supplies to see if it needed to be cleared off but I found the whole kitchen cleaned with my mom inside. She said she finished cleaning the kitchen, and I said “oh well now I don’t know if I shoud paint like I wanted.” Jokingly. She then put on a strained smile and said “yeah I’d prefer you don’t do that” in the kind of voice that made it sound like she was not giving me a choice, and to be honest it sounded kinda rude. I said “you didn’t have to be so rude about it.”, and went upstairs. I came down with my laundry later and she said sorry about being so rude and it’s “just in her nature”. I guess, but I dont like when she says things like that. Anyways, she said I could paint but I’d have to clean up. I said I’d always clean up and then she passively aggressively goes on to say that I never clean up even though I always clean up when I paint. I expressed this and she said I was making it more than it was. I got mad and snapped and said “you’re the one making a big deal about it!” And I went back upstairs. I heard my mom mutter, “wow” and honestly it just ticked me off. 

 I clean up after myself! It’s my brother who dosent, but apparently me leaving a book or two downstairs on the table counts and me not cleaning up. I mean yeah, she just finished cleaning, but I always clean up after myself, especially when I do something as messy as painting! 

I love my mom, it’s just I felt she was being kind of rude here. Am I in the wrong?

Ps, this is my first post and on mobile so sorry for odd formatting","YTA, seriously. Learn how to live with other people. She just cleaned the entire kitchen, she's entitled to ask (in what sounded like a light-hearted but still serious way, not as rude as you think) you to not deliberately make a big mess with paints.

Grow up, people have conflicts and have to communicate their problems, and that alone does not make them passive-aggressive. Please go apologize to your mother, and thank her profusely for cleaning your living space alone.

2575,"WIBTA for telling my grandma I'm an athiest? On mobile, worry for formatting issues

Some backstory: So I (20F if it matters) am an athiest/agnostic. I was raised religious but not extremely. We went to church maybe twice or so a month and prayed in the evenings and all that. So I told my mom I didnt believe in God when I was in middle school and she... didnt take it well. Crying, saying she felt like a failure, all that. Luckily my dad was very supportive. Eventually she accepts it, though she doesnt like to talk about it still. 
Now to the meat of the issue, my grandma is pretty religious. She goes every Sunday, volunteers and is in church groups. She doesnt know I'm an athiest, I think she just thinks I'm still religious, I just dont like church. She hasn't ever confronted me about it, she made some comments about how we should go to church when I first stopped going but nothing else recently. I am pretty close to my grandma and I wish I could tell her my beliefs, and for a long time I was too scared. I recently asked my mom if I should tell my grandma and she said not to because my grandma would blame her and get upset. I also asked my brother and my best friend and they both said I shouldn't because it will just upset her and there's no point. My friend also mentioned that he has lost family for having similar beliefs, and he told me it's better to just stay quiet even though it sucks sometimes. I understand what they're saying, I just wanted to hear what you all think. I'm leaning to ward not telling her right now but I feel like at some point I will need to. 
Tldr: my grandma is religious and im not, family and friends say not to tell her but I kind of want to

2585,"AITA for possibly taking a PTO date out from under someone, when I'm entitled to it due to seniority? My company just implemented a new PTO scheduling system. Previously, a calendar would circulate around our group from the most senior to the least in rounds, with various rules about how much PTO you could choose at which round. We're allowed 2 people off at any time.

For 2020, the company has an automatic scheduling system, wherein everyone bids for ALL of their PTO online during an open round, and when the round is over, the system then automatically grants two full work weeks of PTO to each person based on the same rules and seniority. Then Round 2 starts, where you can adjust your bids and rankings based on the previous Round's results, and you don’t know if you’ve been granted your choices until the current open round ends and the next one begins. 

This confused my small group, so the 6 of us had a call to go over the process. I hadn’t looked at the 2020 calendar yet, but they all started talking about who’s requesting what, waitlisting one week vs. another, etc.  I’m high in seniority, so I usually can get Thanksgiving and Christmas by Round 2 – I like those weeks because I only use 4 PTO days but get a straight 9 days off work. I don’t have kids or longstanding vacation plans, I just like taking the least amount of PTO and getting the most time away from the office. I said on the call I usually take Thanksgiving and Xmas, but I’m not married to those holidays, and pretty much tuned the rest of the conversation out. I figure whatever happens, happens, the system is automatic, whatever.  My attention finally gets back to the call when I hear a coworker reading out “Okay, Jane and Bob are taking the week after Xmas, Jane wants it because it’s her birthday, Mike and Bill are taking the week of Xmas, Xkisses and Dave are taking Thanksgiving….” And I was kinda surprised because the call wasn’t to “pick” days (the bidding system wasn't open yet), it was to go over the process and clear up questions (I thought). I didn’t say anything in opposition, as I hadn’t even looked at the calendar anyway and figured it would all get sorted come bidding time.

Well, the bid system is now open, and I realize that both Xmas and NYD fall on a Friday opposite each other.  This means if I take the week after Xmas, I only spend 4 PTO days, but I get 10 consecutive days off work. And to me, that makes it the most desirable week of the entire year. The chances of me getting that week are high, but that would mean that Jane’s PTO bid for that week (her birthday, remember) would be denied because both Bob and I are senior to her.  And she wouldn’t find that out until the round closes…she wouldn’t lose her other choices, she would get whatever her next ranked week is.

AITA for wanting to schedule that week, when I didn’t argue against someone else taking it during an informal phone call?","Imma say YTA — but not for simply wanting the week and claiming it because of seniority. That’s your right.

I’m a teenager who really likes my room. Tonight, my mom straight up told me that I would have to give up my room for a whole week to my 64 year old grandmother. I would either have to sleep in my brother’s room on his second twin bed, or sleep on an inflatable mattress downstairs. I would also like to add that the door to it leads directly into the loud living room. I asked if she could sleep on the inflatable bed, as my room is pretty much sacred to me, giving me a place to do homework and play games in peace and quiet. She said that she couldn’t because her toe was hurt a bit, and wanted her to have a good bed. We also have a brand new camper that is so fancy it has couch seat warmers and massagers and even a working fireplace. The bed in it is even bigger and more comfortable than mine. I asked if we could plug the camper into our house to give it running water and electricity, but she flat out said no.

I said that I was didn’t want to give up my room, and there had to be a better benefiting compromise. I hate sleeping with my brother because he practically does gymnastics in his sleep, gets up way earlier than I do, watches YouTube in bed early in the morning, is very loud, and keeps me up because he won’t stop talking to me. If I slept downstairs, I wouldn’t be able to go to sleep because I would be able to hear the TV in the living room constantly. She says that I’ll still be able to use my room and computer because my grandmother won’t always be in there, but my grandmother will use the room a lot.

I would be okay with this if it were another relative, but I don't like my grandmother. First, she hates electronics. She lets us play for maybe thirty minutes a day, and constantly went back on her word, because our parents weren’t there. My brother had a breakdown, as he couldn’t do anything he wanted. When she will be staying, there will be three days where my parents won’t be there, as they will be leaving and letting my grandmother supervise. Also, she isn’t an accepting person. I expressed that I am an atheist, and she said, “No, you’re not an atheist. You don’t have enough experience to make that opinion.” This really angered me. She basically said that I didn’t have enough experience with religion to make my own opinions on the matter, even though I have in fact done research into the subject multiple times, in order to confirm my beliefs.

My mother said that I was being extremely selfish, never thought of others, and couldn’t see past myself. I tried compromise, but she wasn’t open to it. AITA for not giving up my room for a week for my grandmother?

Anyway. I average he takes about 2 days off work a fortnight, his excuses seem to be his kids always having to go the doctors or his wife is suddenly in hospital yada yada yada, just alot of excuses that dont really make sense. Hes also disgustingly lazy and tries to leave early most days.

We have a number of work vehicles and sometimes people will call in sick meaning we've lost a work vehicle. Most of the time we'd just drive over and pick it up, no biggie.

I guess first is that the content: the groups tended to be defined by stereotypes (e.g., tacos and maracas for Latin Americans) or their struggles here (e.g., slavery and the civil rights movement--which is not all there is to African American history or culture). A related problem is that I just didn't think the movie trailer format was appropriate for capturing something as complex as these histories--for example, something like slavery. They used the apple pre-made trailer formats on ipads, so it was stuff like ""horror"" and ""adventure"" and ""Bollywood"" and ""Teen Beach Party"" where it gives you music and you add pictures and the format makes it look like a trailer in that genre. I appreciate that she wanted the students to learn about these cultures, but (1) I'm not sure how much they learned given the format of the project and (2) I'm afraid the format actually encouraged them to have a very superficial ad stereotypical view of the cultures. Especially in a very predominately white school and town.

I was thinking of meeting privately with her to discuss these concerns. If I do, then I guess really it would be in part recommending against this project in the future for the reasons above, or else that videos be made with a ton of guidance and respect and that the pre-made trailer formats are not appropriate. The kids were very proud of their projects, but I really find it problematic. I would go directly to the teacher, not above her head or to other parents.

Edit: The kids are in late elementary school (average 10 years old).

ETA: Just want to clarify that the project is completed. I was a hesitant about it when I heard about it, but I just talked to my kid about what was respectful vs. not (e.g., some kids wanted to use ""Teen Beach Party"" for slavery or genocide, and my kid was concerned about it). After I saw the videos is when I was thought to talk to the teacher.  
Also, I get it's not going to be college level education, but I learned a lot of stuff (accurate and inaccurate) about slavery and the holocaust when I was younger than that. I don't think people would have responded well to kids exploring Jewish culture by making horror movie trailers about the holocaust.","YTA.  I think you are crossing the line from ""concerned parent who wants to be involved in their child's education"" to ""that control freak who never shuts up at the PTA meetings"" stereotype.   If you think your child's project was offensive, then you can discuss it with them/correct them at home.  

Also I don't think your concern about them thinking slavery/civil rights movement is all there is to african american culture is valid - especially with young children, it's only natural to focus on the big historical things, and the rest will be filled in as they progress through school.  You can't condense an entire culture completely/accurately into one project.",1,YTA,,0.0,0
2602,"AITA for wanting to be friends with a guy who asked for my number at a music festival? Context: I (24F) have a boyfriend (26M) and we’ve been together for almost 1.5 years. When my boyfriend can’t come with me to music festivals due to money or work, I go alone. I don’t have friends to go with, and besides, I genuinely enjoy being alone at events. I don’t dance with other guys, I don’t flirt with other guys, I don’t talk to any guys unless they’re not being creeps. My boyfriend has some issues with insecurity and paranoia (and he’s aware of this), so he gets worried and uncomfortable whenever I do go to events. I do my best to reassure him, I text him as much as I can when I’m out, update him on what’s happening, have my location on so he sees where I am, all that stuff.

I recently went to an event alone. Sometime during the night, guy comes and starts talking to me. We only talked for maybe a minute and he asked for my number saying “I’m not trying to hit on you. Just don’t have a lot of friends who are into this music.” So I gave him my number. Couple days later, we add each other on IG. Boyfriend sees this new follow and asks me who it is so I tell him. Instantly gets upset.

Before I continue, I’d like to explain that I’m not the best at making friends. I don’t have a lot of people I consider friends (as in I can count the number on one hand), and I’ve made most of my friends because they’ve approached me first, never the other way around. Also, most of my friends are guys. It’s been like this for years and I’ve never had a problem with a guy friend trying to get in my pants or anything like that. What usually happens is we start talking, I make it clear that I am in a relationship so the most we can be is friends, and leave it up to them if they want to continue talking to me. I understand that it’s not a preferable way of making friends when you’re a girl in a relationship, but I make my boundaries clear early on and keep it strictly platonic.

So back to the present, boyfriend is asking me questions like how long I was with him at the event, what we talk about, how much we talk, etc. He insists for a while that I flirted with him which I reassure many times I didn’t (and no, I really didn’t flirt with him.) He worries we’re getting too close and that I’m flirting with him. I’ve reassured him with pretty much every reply, acknowledging his worries, validating his feelings, reminding him that I will keep my distance and maintain my boundaries. I even sent him a screenshot of me explaining to the guy that I am taken and that the most we can be is friends. Still paranoid, worried, and getting more upset and uncomfortable with every minute. 

I truly believe I’m not doing anything wrong by trying to make a friend, even though I understand the way I do it can be worrying. Maybe in the future I can tell him who I meet before he has to find out himself, but other than that, I’ve been trying my best to reassure him and calm his worries.","FYI Guys will often say, “I’m not hitting on you” when they’re hitting on you.",1,YTA,0.0,0.0,0
2603,"AITA - For not wanting a 3rd kid? My wife and I have been dating for 10 years married for 5 and we have 2 kids. Since even before we had our first one I always told her I want 2 kids and not more than that while she wanted 2-3. After our second was a few month's old we talked about contraceptives and what next steps to take. I told her I'd like to have a vasectomy but she suggested she takes a copper IUD and go for vasectomy after. I reluctantly agreed mostly because the IUD seemed safe.

&#x200B;

A year passes and one night she shows me a positive pregnancy test. I tell her how that is possible and her response is that we must have been very unlucky. I ask her if she's lost the IUD and she tells me it can't be and it must have moved up inside. A few days pass while we wait for the gynecologist appointment all while we mostly avoid each other because I got suspicious that she's trying to trick me. For this part I definitely am an asshole because it turns out the IUD was still inside her and I apologized for that.

&#x200B;

Problem is now what to do with the kid. I told her that we agreed on having 2 kids and that while she was watching our 2 kids and I was the only working part that our savings where hurting a little bit each year. Still enough for 3-4 months rent but if it would go on another 4-5 years we would definitely be in a tough spot. Also I was done with having kids... I was perfectly happy with 2 and just didn't want more. Risking our integrity and forcing our 2 kids to share what we have with another sibling seemed unfair to me.

&#x200B;

Now before I go on with the next part I'd like to tell you a little bit about us. We've been boyfriend and girlfriend since we were 15 years old. Both never had a partner before and we agreed with one another with every major decision ever since. We almost never had any really bad fights so this turned out to be our biggest one ever.

&#x200B;

Nothing that I said seemed to be able to sway her. No logical argument worked. It was like talking to a different person. She said that having an abortion is a horrible experience and that she doesn't want to go through that and that it was her body and her decision to make. Bam.. just like that I'm demoted to a joke... can't leave her because I want to keep my 2 kids - don't want to stay with a person that decided I don't have a saying in this at all. Fast forward a month and I calculated all possible outcomes for this and the only really noteworthy thing to mention is that the kids would loose the most no matter what and I did not want that.

&#x200B;

The number of people of friends family and co. in support of her not going through an abortion outnumber my support for not forcing me to raise a third kid I don't want and risk my family's integrity by 10:1. All this happened about a year ago.

2610,"AITA for thinking the dog getting into some allergy medicine is my girlfriends fault? This just happened about two hours ago. I get home, let the dog out of his kennel, do my usual routine with him and then hop in the shower. Our dog is only about 5 months old so he still likes to get into stuff, and today he got some allergy medicine my girlfriend had left on her nightstand while I was in the shower. Chewed the bottle up pretty bad so I sent her a picture asking what it was so o could take the necessary precautions. Once I realized he would be fine I told her as much and to be sure and put it away next time where he couldn’t get to it. 

She responded by telling me he wasn’t allowed on the bed anymore because that’s how he got to it, so it wasn’t on her. I told her that he would have gotten to it regardless of the bed and that it really wasn’t a big deal. She goofed, which is okay, and now we know what to do in the future. She replied telling me she would put it in her drawer next time but that she still didn’t think it was her fault. 

This is where I started to think this was a bigger issue. I told her that I didn’t really get why she was so hung up on that one part of the situation and how I thought it was weird she couldn’t just say something like “Shit my bad” and move on. I reiterated again that it was no big deal but that it was worrying that her first response was to get defensive about the issue. She said it’s because she’s been trying to keep Bernie (our dog, just gonna use his name from now on) off the bed and since I let him on every once in a while he doesn’t listen to her (personally, I just don’t think she’s good at asserting dominance over him since she’s a pretty shy person in general). She said this was the reason she was getting defensive. 

At this point the conversation and taken a more emotional time. I told her that we could go back and forth over why Bernie doesn’t listen to her but at the end of the day she was trying to argue that fault lies with me or Bernard and not her. I shared my own explanation for why I thought she was getting defensive (ultimately that she cares so much for Bernie that she was trying to convince herself that the potential harm that could have come his way was out of her control) and it devolved into us essentially repeating the same things I’m angrier tones. The conversation eventually ended with me saying that I didn’t care whether or not she owned up to it but that I had expected more of her

Our dog is fine so that isn’t my issue here. I take issue with the fact that she can’t own up to a very simple mistake. It worries me because I grew up around parents that always had to be right and I know how detrimental it can be, not just to her own growth as a person but to our growth as a relationship. I’m just looking to figure out if I’m the asshole for trying to get my girlfriend to own up to what I believe was a mistake. 

TL;DR: Girlfriend refused to admit she dun goofed, I tried to convince her otherwise because admitting fault is an important quality to have in my mind, it devolves into an argument ","I think you're the asshole. Keeping medicine on the nightstand is a very reasonable thing to do, and there is no reason that your girlfriend should have been able to predict the future to know that the dog would get into the pills. She agreed to corrective measures once the problem appeared, and then you appear to have picked a fight over her not apologizing immediately for something she could not have predicted. If she should have known it would be an issue, then by the same logic *you* should have also known it would be an issue and you are equally at fault for not taking preventative steps.

Furthermore, it is absolutely true that if you let the dog do something that your girlfriend is trying to train them not to do, you are making the training that much harder. ",1,YTA,0.0,0.0,0

2613,"WIBTA if I coerced my friend into drinking and breaking a 'no drinking' commitment First things first: My friend is **not** an alcoholic. He does not have a drinking problem in the traditional sense.

My friend recently moved a fair way away and as a result has fallen off the map socially. He's quite isolated where he is. We still have a strong core group of friends in our original city. He's also pretty lazy, he's been that way his whole life. Just the kind of guy you're always going to make more of an effort for than he will with you, but we all still love him and accepted thats the way he is

With those 2 things combined, he never makes the effort to come and see us anymore. We're worried he could fall into some depression as he's always been a very social-able dude, but only when its easy. He started drinking a lot at home alone, but not to the point where he was an alcoholic, but he put on some weight and just didn't like the mini hangovers each morning, so he started a no alcohol commitment until Christmas

This isn't new, he loves attempting and failing these. If its not alcohol, its fast food, or gym, or any other random thing he feels is having a slightly negative effect on his life. He **always** fails. To be blunt, most of them are stupid. He has zero foresight, doesn't see how hard certain things will be and over commits and breaks.

He's actually already broken his 'no drinking' commitment before christmas already about 7 days in when a family member came to his house and has now since restarted it.

So its my birthday. Our social circle are looking for any reason to get him up here just to see him and make him feel alive again, but he refuses all invitations because as mentioned above he's lazy, but he's hiding behind the 'no drinking' commitment.

WIBTA if I guilted him into coming up for my birthday, essentially ensuring he drinks?

To be blunt, I don't take his no drink challenge seriously. He's already broken it once already and is 0% chance to actually last until Christmas. I think him coming up here and drinking is for the greater good. We feel like he needs this. And yes we have all made the effort to go down there, but we can't get the entire gang down there all at once as its obviously a logistical nightmare because of the isolation. Am I an asshole for thinking like this?

**EDIT**: I need to quickly edit an emphasis: If I invite him, he drinks. I don't need to ask him to drink, I don't need to buy him a drink, I don't need to do anything. My choices are don't invite him to my birthday to ""protect him from himself"", or invite him knowing it will cause him to break his commitment to himself","YTA.

The way you talk about this guy is so incredibly disrespectful that I have a hard time believing you are actually friends.  You call him lazy over and over again.  You are convinced he is incapable of keeping any kind of resolution.

2615,"AITA for taking my friend's fears personally? Me and a couple of close friends (4 guys and 5 girls) where hanging out at our friend's house over the weekend. After dinner we all sat down, had a couple of beers and talked with each other, just like we usually do. I noticed that one of my friends (let's call her Kelly) wasn't drinking and it then struck me that I couldn't remember the last time I've seen her drink alcohol. I absolutely don't have anything against people who choose to stay sober, but Kelly had told us stories about her recently getting drunk (without any men present) so I knew that she wasn't fully abstaining from it. I asked her about this and also reaffirmed that I didn't mind it at all and was just being curious. She told me that for the last year or so she had refrained from getting drunk among men since she didn't feel safe doing so. This of course made me concerned. I asked her if there was any specific incident that had made her come to this conclusion, but she assured me that it wasn't. She said it was a decision that grew forth over time from reading the news, hearing stories and things like men groping her at the club.

Now this is where the potential assholery begins. In the group we have all known each other for at least five years and I've known Kelly since grade school. The house we stayed in was out in the forrest, far away from anyone else so we weren't going to meet any other people that night. When she said this I therefore interpreted it as that she didn't trust us guys not to take advantage of her if she got drunk. As far as I can tell none of us has ever shown any tendencies that would support this. We've all gotten drunk together plenty of times and I've never seen any of them make unwanted advances or anything like that. I told Kelly that I understood where she was coming from, but that I felt hurt that she choose to apply this rule even when it was just us guys from the friend group there. During my explanation two other friends, one guy and one girl, joined the conversation and asked us what we were talking about. I let Kelly tell them the story whereupon the other guy reacted basically the same way as I did. The girl however told us both that it was non of our business and that Kelly didn't have to motivate her decisions to us. I handled this the same way I always do when a confrontation is imminent: I told a joke at my own expense and changed the subject. We didn't talk anymore about it, but the rest of the weekend was a little tense between the people on the opposing sides of the conversation.

&#x200B;

In short, my brother was always the nerdier one of the two of us and as a child and young teen, I was a bit of a bully towards him. In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.

&#x200B;

Throughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. 

&#x200B;

I'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a ""weirdo"" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.

Over the last 3 or 4 years, my social group has undergone some morphing and changing. We have settled out into a fairly diverse collection of people in terms of race, age, and activities or interests we pursue (There is only one woman in the group regularly, but more on that later) We do everything from attend protests together, playing sports, concerts, hosting parties, camping, DIY home projects, gardening, home brewing beer, or just sitting down to play card games and board games together. At least 3 to 5 of us get together on a weekly basis, sometimes more. Everyone is emotionally supportive and expresses platonic love without being homophobic or insecure, it's a group I'm proud to be a part of and I have a lot of respect for them.

He's in his 30's, unmarried, successful in his field, owns a decent home and nice car, super funny, nerdy, handy with tools, to top it off he's creative, intelligent, and kind. He's kind of a group favorite and has a lot of social capital within our group. This guy also hosts most of our events, whether it's spontaneous hanging out or a planned occasion. He loves to throw parties, he has a perfect space for hosting, and he's somewhat central to all of our locations. We can all be at his place within 20 minutes roughly. Well, he started dating this woman, and initially she was well received. She seemed articulate, college educated, cares about the plights of others, and genuinely invested in our friend. For the first few months we were pleased our friend had someone, and the minor little social faux pas were ignored as a one off or not that big of a deal.

She's not a mean or rude person, she's moral and genuine, and cares about my friend. \*But her social rhythm is out of step with ours.\* She is the best person I feel the worst about. She's loud, she doesn't or can't engage with the activities we participate in meaningfully (concentration, it seems, is the issue), she invites other people to events w/out asking, she doesn't read the room when suggesting music or entertainment, and sometimes will have such anxiety or discomfort that my friend is required to be pulled out of the evening to assuage her or calm her down.To fend off any accusations of misogyny girlfriends or women are a welcome addition to the group.

2627,"AITA For Not Respecting my GF's culture in relation to our potential kids? My girlfriend (23) is like an eight native American (NA for now). However, she is one of the whitest girls I know. She grew up with her late grandpa teaching her about NA culture where she got a NA ID card and a tribal name. 

I have known her 5-ish years and she never really did seem into NA culture at all. She would even joke about how she got money for college because she has her NA card. From my POV is seemed like it was just a thing that she did when she was young and didn’t care about. She has never shared any of it with me because she doesn’t seem interested. Her mom is a typical wine mom stereotype and has never brought up their NA culture. Her dad (divorced) kind a does NA stuff, but mostly at the casino.

She started her masters at a big D1 school this year, but we went to a smallish college for undergrad. She found a NA club and started getting into the culture more and capped it off with a pow wow this past weekend. 

I want to support her, but this situation seems odd. We started talking about kids and how she wanted to raise her kids in the NA culture the way she was. However, she wants to do more then she did. She says she regrets not doing more, even though this is the first I have heard of this in 5 years of being best friends. I said that I would want my kids to be just Americans because I do not really believe in claiming something that you don’t really belong too. For example, my family is almost entirely German, but I don’t really claim German culture or heritage. Don’t get me wrong, I am fine with exploring your heritage and appreciating it but giving my kid a NA name and taking them to pow wows is too far for me. If they want to know who their ancestors are, I will support it though. 

I said the kids would be diluted to the point where they are not really NA and she called me ignorant. I called her out on how much she has changed these past few months and she said that she used to be ignorant. I told her she was changing in ways that I wasn’t comfortable with.

I am 22 and we both agreed on waiting for kids until 26-ish by the way. 

Anyways, am I the asshole for not respecting my girlfriend’s culture?

Edit: she has a 'normal' name our kids with have 'normal' names. The tribal name is like a secondary nickname type thing.

Throughout the process, my wife (33) has been super supportive, and a fantastic mother to our 2 year old.  Now that I'm poised to graduate, she rightfully wants to pursue her career.  She's determined to be a dermatologist.  However, I voiced some concerns.  Namely, the HUGE time commitment that med school will be.  She seems to brush it off, much to my frustration.  She has yet to start undergraduate school, so that's 4 years.  From what I understand, med school will be an *additional* 4 years, and *another* 3-7 years of residency.   Even under the most liberal estimation, that's another 11 years before she's an MD.   Not to mention that during that time she will basically be MIA due to the demand of med school.  Meanwhile, I will be taking the bar and starting an extremely demanding career where I will be the sole money maker and caretaker of our 2 year old.

I've never said she should NOT go, only that the time commitment is very real, and that she should consider alternatives such as Nurse Practitioner, OT school, etc.  Yet, every time the conversation has come up she gets SUPER defensive.  She's even said, ""maybe we should just get a divorce and I can do what I want.""

I want to be supportive, and honestly, if she already had undergrad under he belt  (as I did before starting law school) I'd be more behind the idea.

2633,"WIBTA for bringing a targeted lgbtq book to a family book exchange with a group of religious conservatives Some back story, I will be gathering with a total of 11 family members for the holiday (out of state) and we all agreed on a book gift exchange instead of direct gifts. However at least 7 of the family are strongly conservative and deeply religious (Christian). 

This past year a cousin of mine came out as gay and the family (who I’ll be visiting) has shunned them, accusing their daughter of sinning, and questioning “how could they do this after being raised as they were”. I am an atheist (not highly vocal to avoid drama) and identify politically progressive, but see myself as a human rights and lgbtq advocate to friends, peers, etc. It bothers me that they have more or less cut off my cousin (likely won’t attend the holidays) and morally I feel like I should be standing up for their lifestyle choices. 

And so rises my dilemma, I could of course choose a normal book and carry on with the holiday as it will roll, or I could go about with my other idea. I have considered instead bringing my book as a “how to integrate lgbtq principles into a Cristian/conservative lifestyle” (“Changing our mind” or “unfair: Christians and the lgbtq question”) to advocate for my cousin and potentially bring my family to accept or understand them better. Would I be encroaching on their beliefs and family dynamics where I shouldn’t be, or is this stirring up family drama where it isn’t needed and could be avoided? Or is this a justified position to stand up for what I believe and advocate for better understanding and acceptance? Of course no guarantee with who ends up “winning” the book and even lesser so that anybody reads it I just feel wrong to sit idly by and do nothing.

2644,"AITA for tuning out when my co-workers start talking about private topics? Hi, so recently I had a bit of a situation with my co-workers that made me wonder if I've been acting rudely towards them without realizing it.

First off, I (23f) should explain that I'm quite a private and generally more quiet person. It takes me awhile to open up with people and I don't like casually discussing my private life at work in any case.

I think the main issue here is that I'm currently working at a really small firm, with only my boss and two other (female) co-workers. There's another woman at the office, a bit older, but she's only renting one of the rooms for her own business.

Another issue is that I personally know the other two girls, because we studied at the same uni. I don't know them well, mind you, I only took 2 classes with them throughout the entirety of my studies. However, they're a lot closer and friendlier with each other.

So the three of us obviously work in a small environment together, have lunch and coffee every day etc. During breaks, my co-workers often start talking about something that's obviously a private topic between them; e.g. recently, they've been talking about some guy one of them met on Tinder. I feel uncomfortable listening to that because I feel like I'm eavesdropping, but if I just get up and leave whenever they start talking to each other a bit more, I'll come off as impolite. Therefore when that happens, I tune out respectfully (at least I think so?) and browse through my phone until they switch back to a more general topic.

However, they caught me off guard the other day, when one of the girls asked me for my opinion about a specific situation with her guy from Tinder. I didn't know what she was talking about, because as I said, I didn't listen to their private conversations since it seemed inappropriate for me to eavesdrop. But my co-workers were kind of surprised, maybe a bit offended, that I didn't listen to them at all. They said they wouldn't talk about that in front of me if it was a terribly private topic. I personally thought they just organically started talking about something between them since they're close, and that didn't necessarily mean I should participate in the conversation. Not to mention I don't really want to.

AITA for this behavior? Like, I'm not sure if someone is an asshole here at all, or if we just had different interpretations of the same situation in mind.","Hmm. YTA - as in, you're coming across as one to those around you, albeit not intentionally.

Your internal reasoning is understandable, but it's just internal to you. Assholery is how you present yourself to others.

To flip it around to their perspective - the three of you are having a conversation (as you're joining in), then mid conversation, you're tuning out, picking up your phone, ignoring them, and then tuning back in later when the conversation suits. If I was chatting with two other people, and one person did that, unless they were waiting for an important message / call, I'd consider them rude.

You don't have an obligation to listen to their conversations, and join in. On our office lunches, people all chat together, but some people sit and read the paper / do the crossword etc.

So as my housekeeper was preparing tonight’s dinner, I was combing my dog’s hair, squatting on the floor near the dinner table. My housekeeper said “don’t comb here, it’s too close to the food” and grabbed me off the floor as she was saying this, and pushed me to the other side. I was astonished that she would push me like that. I asked my sister if I should say anything but my sister just said she’s always been rude and that’s just how she is. 

So I go on to eat dinner, and my parents come home around this time with 2 guests: my moms friend who we haven’t seen in 5 years and my grandma who just flew in yesterday.

My dog ate half a cup of dog food - she hadn’t eaten all day until we were finally home since she only likes eating when people are around. I realized a bit later she had finished the half so I go to put another half cup of dog food in her bowl.

2649,"AITA for forcing another driver to miss their exit? This occurred yesterday while driving home from work.

Now a little back story. I’m driving in the left lane with the flow of traffic doing roughly 78 MPH. As we were passing an on-ramp, another driver (let's call them Otter) wanted to get over to the left lane as quick as possible, but without getting up to speed first. Now there was plenty of room for a car to fit between me and the car in front, but that doesn’t mean it’s okay to merge. So Otter, who just came onto the expressway puts their turn signal on and comes over into the left lane causing me to slam on my brakes and drop my speed to 60 MPH. I was almost touching their bumper. Thankfully no one was close enough behind me or else I think I would’ve been hit from behind it was so sudden. I slam on my horn but of course that does nothing. They eventually get up to speed and we continue on.

Fast forward a few miles; this is where things get tricky because our expressway splits into two different expressways. But before this happens a third lane opens up for people to merge and make sure they are in the correct lane for the split. Keep in mind, myself and Otter stayed in the left lane all the way to this point. Traffic was moving at a normal pace for the split but Otter decides a half mile from the split to put their turn signal on to get over. Clearly they want to go right; however, they make no effort to actually get over. They don’t slow down or speed up. They stay at the same speed as the car in lane next to us. I see this and move over to get behind that car and get just close enough that Otter cannot squeeze in. We make it to the split and they are stuck in the left lane. I see them throw their hands up in frustration. To make it seem like I didn’t do it on purpose I continue to the right and take the other expressway, adding a few more minutes to my commute. I think it was worth it.

2650,"WIBTA if I staged a break-in at my house? Hi reddit. I know this sounds extreme, but I am really sick of this and I want to prove a point. Sorry for the long post. Tell me if I’m an asshole. 

So, we live in a decent area, but there is a lot of petty crime, particularly theft. We have had all of our bikes stolen when the the gate was left unlocked, and we hear reports all the time of minor break-ins to cars and homes. Recently our neighbor had their car stolen. 

Well my mom finally installed an alarm system, but only after a few years of me begging for one. As a girl who used to be left home alone overnight often, I thought it was probably a good idea. The only problem is she never arms it. 

In fact, she often disarms it to go into the yard or where ever after I have armed it, and refuses to arm it again. She leaves the porch door wide open too. 

This all from a woman who in our previous house (with zero crime) told me if kept wearing headphones in the house, someone would break in and kill me (I get it, using fear tactic to make teenager not wear headphone. But really?) 

Anyway, to the incident. Last night when I got home late, she had not armed the house yet. Not only that, she had left the side door wide open. When I armed the house, she disarmed it to get the mail and didn’t turn it on again. So I said “do you not like arming the house?” And she snapped at me to “just shut up.”

Being told to shut up by my parents makes me really fucking mad. So I said something under my breath like “don’t be such an asshole.” Which I realize probably makes me an asshole. For that I’ve been “grounded” (I’m 21 lol) to think about what I’ve done. 

Well I’m thinking. And what I wanna know is if I would be be a bigger asshole if the next time she leaves the door open and house unarmed, I hide something big like a computer or fancy blender or something that she would notice.

For some time now I've been expressing that I wanted to upgrade my PC (the components were aging quite a bit) and so I made a list of the parts I want and gave it to my dad, who sent it off to various family members to contribute. I'd contribute too.

I bought the graphics card and SSD, Dad bought the motherboard and RAM, Aunt got the me the processor and Grandma got me the power supply. (Dad tasked them, I didn't. I don't use Facebook because it's full of Karens.)

Now note that I had given everyone a specific part, within a reasonable price point, and they would get a huge deal on Black Friday, the day before my birthday.

Come my birthday, I turned 18 and everyone was to congratulate me for becoming an adult. Cheers and conversation over really good food was had. It was a great time.

Then I got my gifts. Everyone got me exactly what I wanted, and I expressed my greatest gratitude and thanks, and gave them a hug.

And here comes Grandma, with the power supply unit that she was tasked with.

Now I didn't ask for anything outrageously expensive (like those $200 RGB fully modular 80 Plus Gold power supplies with Japanese capacitors), but I did ask for a 750W supply with partial modularity that was around the $100 price point, and said good PSUs cost a lot.

I get my gift, and it's a unit from a brand I've never heard of called Logisys.

Again, I give my grandma the utmost gratitude, but tell her I am a little concerned. That I've never heard of this brand before and don't see any certification on it, and it looks very sketchy.

Grandma says she got it because it was cheaper and would still deliver on what I needed.

I then calmly explain that she needs to be careful with off-brand power supplies, as a lot of the cheap ones often have shoddy soldering, wiring, insulation and capacitors, and don't have any certification or testing. And if I put this in my system, my PC could potentially be fried.

My mom starts jumping on me and saying ""Stop being ungrateful, she put a lot of thought into getting that for you"" And Grandma and most others take her side.

But a few take mine and I tell her that there's a reason that you shouldn't buy unverified electronics from China, because they're often riddled with problems.

Eventually it turns into a small debate between family members about ""gratefulness"" and Chinese products and ""it's the thought that counts"", which kinda soured the mood and made me feel pretty bad. It only got resolved when dessert and coffee were ready.

Mom and Grandma gave me the stink eye for a moment and I just ate my cheesecake away from them.

Either way now I'm stuck with a piece of Chinese junk that I wouldn't dare put into my build. I think I might get myself a good one from Amazon on Cyber Monday.

Really was I in the wrong to complain about the unit I got? And would I be even more of an asshole if I discreetly recycled it?","10,000,000% YTA. You could have asked Grandma for a power supply and she would have given you a Hanna Montana CD. It doesn’t matter. It’s Grandma.

You shut up, sell the PSU, pony up the difference for the one you want, and get on with your life.

2660,"AITA for asking roommate to eat earlier so that she doesn’t bother my dog A little context because it is VERY necessary. I live in a four bedroom apartment with two lovely gals, one of them is my best friend and the other is a girl we found on Facebook, H. Remember H. 

A few months ago, before we moved into the apartment, BFF and I decided to adopt a dog, thus enters our gorgeous 5 mo husky pup. She is rambunctious but sweet and finally starting to get over her PUPPY puppy stage. H was promptly alerted and showed excitement for the newest little roommate. 

Now we have all been living together for almost a month, but we’ve encountered a major conflict. Pup sleeps in her kennel in the living room at night. She whines in her kennel until the lights are off and she can’t see anyone, because she loves attention. We try to kennel her somewhere between 10pm and 11pm. Seems like a reasonable time to hit the sack, right? Wrong. 

Ever since we moved in, H has been a night owl. But recently, she has been coming home and cooking herself dinner anywhere between the times of 11pm and 1am. Other than the fact that SHE makes a lot of noise in the kitchen (attached to living room, open concept) and wakes me and BFF up, obviously, she also wakes up pup, who barks for attention. 

So in the dead of night, BFF and I are woken up to not only noises in the kitchen, but pup barking until H goes to bed. Obviously we’re all a little frustrated, I hate even thinking about our poor neighbors. 

However, today H asked us to move pup into the spare bedroom because she barks so much while she’s cooking. Obviously since it was our dog who was causing the problem (kinda) we agreed, so we moved her into the dark, bare room. She hated it. HATED it. Which seems so crazy because she usually won’t settle until the lights are out and everyone is gone anyway, but she just really hated this room. Barking and whining nonstop. 

I would also just like to add that this is around 11pm when we are attempting to do this. H isn’t home yet. 

BFF and I waited for about 15 minutes for pup to stop. She never did. So we moved her out into the living room again. Now, of course we would try to move her into either of our bedrooms, but there simply isn’t enough space because the rooms are too small and her kennel is so large. So at this point, literally our only option would be to keep pup out in the living room.

Would we be assholes if we asked H to cook/eat earlier so that pup doesn’t bark in the wee hours of the night? It’s not like we’re asking her to be home and fed by sundown, literally just before 10-11ish so that we can all get rest and avoid possible future conflicts with the neighbors.  People coming in and out of the front door quietly doesn’t not disturb pup and cause barking, it’s just all of the excessive cooking noises in the kitchen and lights. 

BFF and I are at our wits end and trying to decide if our request is reasonable, so AWTA?

","YTA and I’m sure I’ll be downvoted for this. 

You and your BFF got a dog and now expect your roommate to change her night schedule so puppy doesn’t get excited and keep you awake. You got a puppy without  *really* realizing that puppies are excitable and bark and need lots of training to teach this behavior out of them.  The cage you put her in through the night isn’t enough to calm her down and stop disturbing your sleep and your neighbors (god I feel bad for your neighbors) so you need to figure out how to train your dog better. It’s not the dog’s fault because she is a puppy. It’s not your roommates fault because she should be able to cook in her apartment when she wants to and be reasonably quiet without expecting a dog to go off. You’ve got to do better.",1,YTA,0.0,0.0,0
2662,"AITA for telling a masseuse that her fingers smelled like butt? Throwaway because this is embarrassing - not a joke.

So I have a habit of just speaking my mind - I don’t sugar coat anything. I’m not a jerk about it, I’m very honest and proud of that. I also have a bit of a “potty mouth.”

Today I was at the spa having a massage & facial done as a treat. First things first, the masseuse had bad breath. It was kinda gross but since we only talked for a couple minutes before the treatment I decided to let it slide.

Unfortunately during my facial I noticed a bad...odor. Like I said, I don’t sugar coat - when her fingers came by my nose, it smelled like #2. It made me gag.

I didn’t wanna embarrass her so I decided to make a joke out of it, because obviously I had to say SOMETHING. This is what I said (in a jokey way remember): “Hey did your last massage client ask you to finger their butthole or something?”

She seemed really confused and weirded out so I asked again. Finally I had to explain that her fingers basically, to me, smelled like sh**. 

She got upset and went and got her manager who asked me to leave. I didn’t wanna make a scene so I did leave, but I argued with them first - 

1) I was paying for a service 
2) I expect the spa and it’s employees to be clean
3) I don’t actually BELIEVE she fingers peoples buttholes, but what if she went to the bathroom and didn’t wash her hands? I don’t want that on my face.

Anyway my husband thinks I was being rude or whatever - I disagree obviously although I won’t be going back.

2664,"AITA for not calling my father’s mother “Grandma”? Yesterday I shared a post that I started my first day as a paramedic student and my father’s mother replied. Here’s our interaction, I want to know if I’m the asshole, I’m really starting to think I am and I know I could’ve handled it differently. Long post I’m sorry. 

Father’s mother (FM): congratulations! 
Me: thank you (first name of FM)! 💚🎉
FM: isn’t it Grandma to you? 
Me: no, I haven’t called you that since I was about 7 years old. 
FM: you’re kidding of course! 
Me: I’m not - that’s around the last time I remember referring to you as anything other than (first name).
FM: I have heard it since you were seven, and that’s who I am to you dear! 
Me: when I think Grandma, that’s my great grandmother who passed away in 2013. Though relationally that is true, we don’t have enough of a relationship for me to feel like that name is correct. It’s like how I feel with my mother’s birth mother.
FM: Well thank you lady, I guess I do not know you either!!
Me: I hope that something as simple as a word doesn’t hurt your feelings. I apologize if it does.
FM: It does not matter if I had not seen you or ever been around you in 20 years or not   I am still your grandma. You can call me grandma or call me nothing. Get It?

Shortly after this she copied and pasted this exchange in a status on her Facebook, and my cousin replied “what a disrespectful little brat. Delete her Grandma!” And FM replied “thank you for taking up for me! Love you!” 

After seeing this I added one more comment to our original exchange: “I hope you realize that behaving in this way is only pushing me away.”

Her most recent comment is this (I haven’t responded and don’t plan to): “Pushing you away? Isn't that where you are?? You called me grandma till recently. What happened? If I am not your grandma you are not my granddaughter. I do not even know you! Pushing away! Ha”

We don’t have much history. I lost respect for her when I learned at a young age that my father was sitting in his bedroom with a pistol, at the age of 13 crying about wanting to kill himself. She came in his room to put his laundry down, saw what he was doing, turned around and walked away without a word (and no, she never called police or anybody else). Thankfully my dad never did it, but how he held off after his mother treated him that way I’ll never understand. 

She’s Jewish and I’m Christian, and I am more than supportive with her religion. When it’s Hanukkah I buy her gift from our family making sure it’s kosher and gluten free for her diet, and it’s wrapped in Hanukkah wrapping and she gets a Hanukkah card instead of a Christmas one that we send out to everybody else. Only reason this is important is because she’s commented to me multiple times that I’m going to hell due to my religion. 

Every interaction is “I’m holier than thou.” She’s been a toxic person in my life a long time but I’ve put up with it for my dad’s sake. Somehow he’s forgiven her doing that and letting him drink alcohol and smoke cigarettes since age 9 and quit school at age 13... he still got a B.B. pellet in his leg after getting shot by his brother because FM didn’t want to pay the doctor. 
Anyway, I’m ranting now sorry. Am I the asshole Reddit? I just think a name like Grandma is to be earned and isn’t a given right.

2666,"AITA is it a gift? A few years ago, a bit after I bought my Nintendo switch, my cousin who lived upstairs in our 2 storey house, kept asking to play with me, unfortunately I couldn’t really play anything with her because I only had two joycons and not many fun games to play with sideways controllers. So I decided to buy an extra pair of controllers and 2 games to gift to her for Christmas and her birthday (her birthday and Christmas around the same time but I still gave her the presents at seperate occasions) but I’m doing this the idea was for her to play these games with me, which We did do for about half a year, then we started to not really play as much, and she didn’t even play some of the games I’d gotten for us.

About a month later I started getting really into the games we had bought, and while I was still upset we didn’t play them together she didn’t really mind and was ok doing her own hobbies. The extra controllers I had bought, I used all the time with friends at school and a few people who would drop by the house, like my brothers friends or family friends, the games I had initially bought for my cousin I had played a lot and sunk a lot of hours into. I understand that she might not like the game or she’d rather play with other things instead of me.

Now at Christmas my uncle bought a Nintendo switch for his kids upstairs, I didn’t really care as mostly my other cousin was the one asking for it, but I knew that my 1st cousin still wanted one, and that’s fine, the switch is about sharing and local play, so they can all have fun upstairs. However my cousin took the 2 games and the controllers upstairs for their console. 
Now most people’s first thought (including my mother) is that we gifted her the controllers so she can do what she wants with them. But I did buy the controllers for MY switch so she could play with ME, but now she’s taken my controllers and games upstairs, the gift that was originally meant for my switch, not for theirs that they would buy 2 years later.

I’m a bit conflicted about the whole thing, I told my mother about how I could no longer play games with my friends, and now she feels as if she has to spend more money on more controllers, because I have had some trouble socialising with people at my school, and I felt that i was communicating well with people through our love of super smash bro’s and Mario party.

If any one has any advice of perspectives if I am the asshole about this I would really love a comment so I could have a discussion

2668,"Aita for treating my favourite at work differently to other staff Am I TA for rewarding staff I deem to work harder than the people I think are slacking off.

So I work in a busy restaurant, I'm related to the owner and head chef but only work one day a week, the busiest day.

So there are numerous staff that work under me on this day and there are some I think don't work as hard as others, one girl in particular I really like and think she's just damn good.

2669,"AITA for pushing my girlfriend to go further sexually after promising not to. Context: Around a week ago, my girlfriend and I met up and she was in a 'weird mood' (her words). She told me that she didn't really want to do anything sexual that day, and, despite that, I kept trying to ask her and push her towards doing sexual things. Obviously I was the asshole in this situation and I have no doubt in my mind about this. There are more details, but the important takeaway is that I didn't respect her desire to not engage with what I was wanting during that moment. As I touched her I kept asking if she was okay with it, because deep down inside I knew that she wasn't really into it, and so I kept asking her whether she is okay with this or not and she kept saying that she was fine with it, and eventually she said that she wasn't and I immediately stopped right before any clothes were removed. I realized that what I did was wrong, as I was aware the entire time that she was not into the experience despite the mixed signals, and I apologized to her, to which she was so unbelievably amazing, forgiving, and understanding that I was taken aback. She instantly forgave me and told me that she doesn't blame me for anything. Because of this, I made a special promise to her that I will make it my absolute priority to never, ever do anything like what I did that day ever again, and told her that I owe it to her to uphold that promise because of how well she has treated me (I would have made this promise even if she had not been as forgiving, obviously, but because of how understanding she was I made sure to tell her about how much I owe her and how much I appreciate her kindness).

&#x200B;

However, after this, a similar situation happened again. The exact details of what we were doing aren't important, but I was pleasuring her and it was very obvious that she was extremely into it and was having potentially the most enjoyable sexual feelings of her lifetime. We took a short break, and I asked if she wants to go further (e.g. do something sexual which we haven't done yet - we are working our way up towards 'more' sexual things, going from shirt to skin, feeling to seeing, etc. We are both Christians and do not wish to have sex before marriage), and she said that she wants to, not now, but in a month's time, as she isn't ready yet. I asked her if she wants to go further in another way, and she said that she will want to soon, but that she isn't ready to do that yet. She then said that we can move to the next level tomorrow, instead of in a month. I then asked if we can go further in a very small way just quickly today before we take the bigger jump tomorrow, and she said okay. We did, and it ended up going much further than just what I suggested as the small thing, and it was in every way a positive experience.

&#x200B;

Today, I asked my girlfriend whether I had broken the special promise that I had made to her - the promise that I owed it to her to keep. She told me that I hadn't at all because she said yes, but I said that I feel like I have, because she said no multiple times, and each time I asked her if she was sure and if there is no possibility that she doesn't want to do something else. While ultimately there was no harm caused by my actions, I believe that I may have violated a trust with my girlfriend. She had not thought about / realized that I have possibly broken my promise until I brought this up to her.

&#x200B;

Once I realized this, I immediately thought that I am the asshole. However, the idea that I kept to the spirit of the promise, just not the exact wording of the promise, came to my head quickly; in the first example, it had a strong feeling that she did not want to continue, despite her stating that she did. This feeling turned out to be correct. In the second example, I had a strong feeling that she did want to continue, despite her stating that she didn't. This feeling also turned out to be correct. Therefore, I kept the spirit of the promise - I did not put pressure on my girlfriend to go further sexually when I could tell that she did not want to - but I may have broken the wording of the promise. Both my girlfriend and I currently hold the opinion that I kept the spirit of the promise, and there is no dissent between us.

&#x200B;

The reason why I'm posting this here is because I am worried that I am a manipulator without being overtly aware of it. I feel like I am too controlling and manipulative over my girlfriend sometimes, and I worry that I brush these occurrences away via the means of mental gymnastics, as demonstrated in the paragraph above.

&#x200B;

Am I the asshole for pushing my girlfriend to go further, breaking the promise I made, or am I in the right, as I kept to the spirit of the promise and did not try to make her do anything that I knew that she did not want to do? Also, is my justification of my actions an example of manipulation, or is it simply a legitimate way of thinking about a situation in which I was not quite at fault?

Just to be clear that the -special promise I’ll never force you sexually- isn’t some special thing you’re doing as a boyfriend, that is a rule, and a law.

Some background: I suffer from bad memory, sometimes I don't even remember what I had for breakfast the day before or the likes, and I've already talked about this with her. We've been dating for half a year and we'd never had a strong discussion before.

So, my girlfriend (24F) and I (25M) had a discussion yesterday because she was being super distant, sharing heartbroken IG images and not talking at all and stuff. I found it weird because she'd never acted like this before. Long story short we talked after work and she broke down crying saying I'd hurt her feelings and stuff because I never pay attention to her and the things she tells me and stuff.

Apparently, her exboyfriend sent her a message saying he was involved in an accident and had some loss of memory. She asked him what he remembered and he told them lots of stuff about her and their previous relationship (they were together for 2 years and broke up like half a year before starting to go out with me). This is important because apparently I don't remember most of the stuff her ex does (like favorite movie, stuff about her studies, stuff like that which I think is not really that important), and she said it's really hurtful that her ex remembers all of that and I don't.

I've told her that it's not that I don't pay her attention, but my memory has always been bad and that doesn't mean I don't care about her, I just sometimes forget some things which I don't find really important, hell, I sometimes forget my SSN and stuff like that.

Some backstory: I have been talking and getting close to a girl for a few months now, we have gone out a few times and we enjoy each others company. We care about each other a lot. However we are not dating, Im not sure whether I am just not ready, if she isnt ready, or a mixture of both.

Being my teammate a friend he instantly came to me about it as he was worried. Upon hearing that she was talking about my personal problems to someone who I dont know and telling them some of the things I have said I immediately got mad about it and started texting her asking why she would do that using some fairly vulgar language. She didnt respond for close to two hours so by that point I was fairly angry. I told her that I shouldnt have ever talked with her or told her about my personal life.

After that I had to leave to go to a wrestling meet and didnt really talk with anyone other than teammates until it was over at about 10, so thats about 7 hours that I didnt talk to anyone.

She also said that she was disappointed in me for backing out, as well as for promising to be able to go. I have lost their trust, and I know that a screwed them over, but I told them sorry for troubling them many times and that I would pay them back for the costs (should i still need to pay for my part of the airbnb costs?). I didn’t cancel for no reason though.
Recently my close cousin had died from a car accident on a vacation trip to Japan. I have no clue as to how it all happened, and i’m waiting to hear an update. Because of this, my parents begged me not to go on our trip. Because I am still dependent on them, I don’t really have a choice. My parents are super protective of me, as this would’ve my first time on a trip without any supervisors, and it honestly surprised me that they said yes in the first place. I think what worries them even more was they asked me if I had wanted to go on the trip with my cousin. I said no fyi. If it helps anymore, my cousin was very close to us, in that my parents treated him as if he were there own son. My cousin was supposed to fly over to us and go on a road trip together next week as well. I thought I had all the time in the world to spend with him, and now I find out that I can’t anymore. Now my parents are on edge, and worried that I’d get in an accident. I already told them that we wouldn’t be driving, and that we’d be using services like lyft or uber, but even then they are are scared. and now I am too.
To add more to this jumbled mess, they aren’t even my friends. I know only one person in the group who invited me. She invited me on the trip (even though she’s kind of reserved? super nice tho), trusting that I would not cancel. AITA? I said i’d pay them back my portion of the costs.

tl;dr I had to cancel a planned trip even though I committed to going b/c of my parents worrying for me.","YTA... if you don't pay your friends.

2676,"AITA for getting angry at a sales lady for telling me I cant leave my kid at the shop? Im was really ticked off but now that I'm at home I am wondering if I should have gotten angry at her. I have also worked in a customer service industry so I feel guilty and was wondering if i was just being an r/entitledparent 

So anyway, I was at the department store with my 2yo. At this rate she was already quite cranky and we needed to go home. I was in a bit of a rush at this point and when she grabbed a toy to play with I told her to put it down as we needed to go. Cue tantrum. She started to cry and I told her I was going to leave as I am teaching her that tantrums don't get her anything. She's very young and I dont want her to associate tantrums with getting her way. 
Anyway I walk away (3meters) and she is well within ny sight and she can see me too. There are no other customers in the area that she can disturb. My daughter generally knows to come to me when this happens and thats when I talk to her and explain why she cant get the toy anymore.
Out of nowhere this saleslady was like ""excuse me, you cant leave your kid here,"" in a hostile manner. 
I tell her, ""Im standing right here, i am not going to leave my kid by herself""
This goes back and forth a bit and she wouldnt listen to me. 
I told her that I am trying to discipline my kid and I have no intention of leaving her alone and at this point my voice was angry. But she just kept saying I gan leave her there. 
So i just take my daughter and tell her to return the toy and head off.
AITA here?

EDIT:
I was not far from her. I was literally 4 steps away from her and have been standing there for a good minute telling her we need to go. I wasnt threatening her that I was going to leave her there. She normally heads to me straight after she's calmed down. But she wasn't given that time since the sales lady butted in.
I did explain to her that I was trying to disciple my child and was not going to leave her but the lady wouldn't budge.

It is completely reasonable to tell someone they can't leave a 2 year old throwing a tantrum on their own.

However after that we kept talking, we weren't together but as she said "" you were my best friend and while I can't forget what you did I understand"" suffice to say she's the greatest person in the world. 

She never had any family (she was kicked out when she was 15) so she came to me and her other friends for advice a lot, I'd sometimes go see her and we'd talk and hang out like we used to, even though there was always a tension around us we started to rekindle a friendship which is far more than I deserved.

Me and my ex got to talking and it obviously turned to the last year and what happened between us, we were both reminiscing and saying that it wished it hadn't ended like that but then she said ""yeah well it's a good thing you haven't been talking to anyone else since it happened because if you had I'd be absolutely heartbroken, I'm glad you decided to take my feelings into account"" .

2700,"AITA for texting my brother in-law about a facebook post he made? First some background:

About 15 years ago my wife and I decided to adopt a dog. We found the most wonderful cute little pup at our local humane society. She was a 9 week old ball of fur and joy, we'll call her Lilly for this story.

Fast forward 5 years and I was offered a job out of the state and we'd have to move in order for me to take the great opportunity. Along that time our son was having severe allergies that were becoming harder to keep in check, and his doctor continued to recommend not having any pets at home. We weren't ready to let Lilly go, so we just kept them apart as much as possible.

Our home search was pretty tough. We found several rentals, but none of them would accept pets. We finally made the hard decision to find a new home for Lilly. I get to take the job and our son can live freely in the house again.

We decided we wanted her to stay with family and luckily my sister in-law and her boyfriend lived about 2 hours from my new job and agreed to take Lilly in. They've taken really good care of her and we visit every now and then to check in on Lilly and see the family.

Lilly has had health issues recently being almost 15: Arthritis, dementia, vision loss. Sister in-law and husband (same guy, they got married) have taken great care of her medical needs. She got even worse recently, and they'd find her on the floor in a puddle of drool. She can't stand still because it's so uncomfortable. The vet told them that her arthritis had spread to her spine and there wasn't anything they can do at this point to help her. They made the decision to have her put down so we got the kids together and did a video call to say goodbye to Lilly. The next day she went to the vet for the last time.

Ok, enough back story

So, Brother in-law, I'll call him Jimmy from now on, posts on facebook some pictures of Lilly, and some nice stories to remember her by. Jimmy also wrote a pretty nice eulogy for Lilly, but there was one problem in my eyes. Here's a quote from what he wrote: ""Ten years ago I rescued Lilly from the family of my then girlfriend (now wife)"".

I wanted to like his posts, because I love Lilly. But that post, I couldn't like it. To me the phrasing makes me feel like we were abusive and he had to swoop in and save her.

So, I decided text Jimmy. I didn't want go through facebook, this was peronal. I've always been cool with him and he seems like a reasonable guy. I figured the adult thing to do is to let him know that his message made me uncomfortable and sad to think that people reading it would infer that we were poor parents to Lilly.

Recently, I was sitting with my SO (let's call her K) at school, and one of her friends (A), who I don't know very well, came up to us and told K that A's crush grabbed A by the pussy.

I had a very busy day at work yesterday and Tuesday’s I also go to the gym after work. My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he’d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was “go go go.”

Driving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some “alone time” to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn’t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there’s anything else he’d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he’s sure because I’m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. 

FIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It’s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that’s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he’s suddenly asking me if that’s how much is left, and I tell him I don’t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can’t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn’t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it.

After the club, we went skinny dipping. I told my boyfriend before I left for this vacay that the girls we're talking about skinny dipping and that I wanted to join them. As a kid, I thought that's what all the college kids did and I've never felt like it was overtly sexual. Just something that was fun. I knew he didn't like the situation, but after telling him that I wanted to be young and have fun, we dropped the convo.

*EDIT 4: We dropped the convo because he said that he'd be okay with it, even if both men and women were there, under the impression that  we were doing it in the ocean. I thought we were doing it in the ocean as well at the time, but I didn't realize he considered the pool or hot-tub a very different situation.*

Fast forward to the beach house, 8 of us college girls and 2 guys go skinny dipping in the pool and then head to the hot tub afterwards. One of the guy friends is gay, and the other one is getting married (his fiancee was also in the hottub).

When I get back home, my boyfriend is very upset about what happened. He kept going on and on about how all those guys 'didn't deserve to see me naked' and how it wouldn't be an issue if I 'weren't so attractive to him.' He said he thought we would be skinny dipping at night at the beach, not in the light, in close proximity to each other in a hot tub. Before the trip, I thought we were skinny dipping at the beach too.

We calmly spoke about it, and I decided that I didn't like seeing him so upset over something like this so I told him he was right and that I was sorry. He was particularly upset at the guy getting married for getting to see me naked. He kept calling it 'the best bachelor party this kid could get'. I didn't fully understand his beef with the married guy but I guess that's why I'm here asking Reddit.

**A:** I would not be upset if he went skinny dipping with 8 dudes, a lesbian, and a woman getting married with her fiancée present (the reverse situation). Not at all. I judged the situation as being non-sexual. If the group of people consisted of several single, straight men, I would not have gone skinny dipping because that would make me very uncomfortable.

Usually. Depends on the situation, and your situation certainly counts as a sexual situation.

This was also posted on TIFU by my partner in crime! I felt it belonged here too. I've had a few people and family members tell me they think it's a bit out of order and outdated in todays political climate.

Mobile obligatory. This happened a few days ago.
Bit of backstory:
So last week it was my bosses birthday, wasn’t a particularly special birthday but her daughters birthday is the following Sunday, so hers often gets forgotten so we wanted to make her feel special. 

We had it planned for weeks, and all outcomes were considered. She wouldn’t have a meeting when she got to work at 8.30, so she’d have time to set the office straight again, no one else would need to go in, and there was no risk of customers seeing what we did. 

So the day before her birthday, we needed access to her office without her being there. She normally leaves at 17.30, so the other staff were going to let us know when she had left. Turns out she was working a long day, so only left at closing time (18.30).

First fuck up, we arrived while she was still there, so had to drive away and hide down a side street until we saw her leave.

For the next 4 hours we proceeded to wrap ALL belongings on her desk (including but not limited to her satsumas- individually- her glasses, stapler, calendar, box of stationary, whiteboard pens, tea bags, and then her desk). We purchased a canister of helium and inflated as many balloons as we could. She enjoys a certain male actor, so we printed lots of pictures of his face and hid them about the office, including one on the balloon we hung outside. We also called a work colleague to bring us some condoms to blow up with helium, which, along with some balloons, we filled with penis confetti. We also bought her stressticles, a penis headband, and topped it all off by throwing some of said penis confetti all over her desk.

For good measure we wrapped the door. 

So the day dawns, and we’re expecting her to arrive on her own, so patiently we wait to catch it on video.

She arrives and makes her way up the stairs. Unfortunately the interviewee that was meant to be coming in later, Handsome McHandsomepants, was following shortly behind her. 

We feel the need to specify the Unsuspecting male is not only a potential employee, but also a customer.

Her face said it all, her mouth certainly didn’t need to. She was terrified.

We felt the need to warn the interviewee that he may not want to see what was on the other side of the door.  He backed away with a nervous grin.

Our boss had to claw through the wrapping paper to get into the office for some paperwork.  (saving grace, we hadn’t wrapped that!)

Then came the eagerly anticipated, very satisfying, very loud exclamation, “THERES DICKS EVERYWHERE!!” 

Thankfully, both our boss and the interviewee took it in good jest, we still have our jobs!


TL;DR AITA Filled my bosses office with lots of different penis shaped things. Unfortunately, she had an interviewee arrive unexpectedly early.","YTA.

2746,"WIBTA if I spent money on a trip while we’re saving for a house? Using a throwaway so my significant other doesn’t see. Posting on mobile, apologies. 

My (28F) significant other (29M) will be turning 30 this year and my idea for basically the past year and half has been that I want to buy a trip for the two of us to go overseas. There’s a lot of other details involved but the main reason for the trip would be to surprise him with tickets to see his favourite soccer team play at their home stadium. This is something he has only ever gotten to do once in his life. 

This year, we started the process of looking at buying a home. We’re at the point now that we just have to shop around and find one basically, but our mortgage broker has given us suggestions of things to do to in the meantime ie. focus on paying CC, save as much as you can etc. My SO will be paying the down payment as he has the bulk of the savings. He was lucky enough to never need student loans and never accrued any debt, whereas I have and am still paying it off. 

To save for the trip I’ve been putting aside any cash I have (from side projects, holidays, birthdays etc) as well as occasionally taking $50 or $100 out here and there when I get paid. I’ve now saved a couple thousand dollars in a bit under a year. My SO knows nothing about this money as I wanted the trip to be a complete surprise.

I’m really conflicted about this because I know his opinion would be to be responsible and put it towards home savings but I also know that once we actually own a home our opportunities for travel will be few and far between as any extra $ would definitely need to be for the house. 

So, WIBTA if I use the money I saved as a surprise trip for my SO instead of putting it towards our future home?","Oooof- don't do this as a surprise, talk to him about it. This should probably be in r/relationships",1,YTA,0.0,0.0,0

I'm really fortunate that mine is mild and only on my arms, while her's is really severe and pretty much covers her entire scalp and parts of her eyebrows. Regardless, I thought we both had a shared experience with the condition.

We aren't like close friends because she's kind of shy, but it really breaks my heart to see all of my other classmates making fun of her for something she can't control. I've never partaken in any of the bullying and I'm not sure if she's even aware because my classmates at least aren't big enough jerks to make fun of her publicly.

Anyways, one time we were in history class and had a bit of free time where we could kind of just talk to each other.

I wasn't really thinking I guess and I reached up and took it off for her and explained that it wasn't a big deal or anything. She didn't say anything so I thought it was okay. Then a little while later the same thing happened, but I asked her to stay still so I could get rid of it and she stopped me and seemed a bit upset and said ""I know it's there, I can do it myself.

2752,"AITA For not wanting to hang with the crew? Throw away because I don’t want my real account found out.  I’ll try and trim all the fat and cut to the chase. This post is strictly “bro code” oriented, so I’m not sure if it’s the right sub but worth a shot. 


- 2 friends and I are out at a nice bar/club. David – who I’m really close with – and John who I met through David. John’s been out with us a few times. I considered John a bro by default, since David’s my bro and has been friends with John for so many years.

- Another friend of David’s, Will, joins us and decides on his own that he wants to buy a bottle for all of us to share out of his own generosity. We have a table exclusive to us thanks to Will. I’ve briefly met Will before, but this is the first time I’ve actually started to get to know him. 

- While away from the table, a blonde girl in a sparkly dress catches my eye. I set on a stool next to where she was sitting, say “Hi, I like your sparkly dress” with a smile. She finishes whatever she was doing on her smart phone, smacks her hand on my shoulder, says “you’re not my type”, briefly using my shoulder as leverage to get up and walk away. EDIT: Let me emphasise this: ***she laid her hands on me in an aggressive manner.*** It wasn't just words. 

- Whatever, I get it. I’ve got a lot of experience approaching girls and never let it phase me. I know that there’s just some girls out there with low self-esteem and need to put down others in order to make themselves feel a semblance of self-adequacy. 

- I return to our table, and it turns out there’s 2 or 3 girls there, talking to Will and David, and also… The sparkly dress girl, who is a friend of those girls. 

- If I chipped in for the bottle/table, I would’ve told the sparkly dress girl that since I’m not her type, she should take a hike, or perhaps call her out and explain how putting other people down isn’t the solution to a low self-esteem. But since Will paid for it all, and was trying to get with one of her friends, I was put in an awkward spot. I was pissed. I told Will & David that she was very rude to me, and asked if I could tell her to fuck off our table. They shrugged their shoulders and didn’t give any clear answer. In hindsight, I wouldn’t have asked. I would’ve just not been at the table and gone solo for the night at the other parts of the bar/club. 

- Anyway, she got up to leave. However, before she left, John started talking to her, so I decided that fuck it, because: 1. A guy who paid for the table is trying to get with her friend and 2. A bro by default is trying to get with the rude girl, I’m just gonna leave and go to another bar that I actually loved going to and know the staff etc. 

- David & John (who I had now explained how rude sparkly dress was to me) insisted I don’t leave, that I shouldn’t let it phase me, etc. I explained that I’m not mad at the girl herself, it’s just the situation that’s fucked. I don’t wanna fuck anyone’s shit up, but I don’t want to hang with that girl as if what she did was acceptable behaviour or not, I’ll just leave and be happy somewhere else. David said to John that he should ditch sparkly dress, but he didn’t. I told John not to, that it's fine, because I believe a friend wouldn't have to be asked to or explained why to not tolerate disrespectful behaviour towards his friend, he just wouldn't.

- I hung around a bit away from the table but eventually left. 

- Lessons learnt from the night: 1) I don’t consider John to be a friend anymore, as he tolerated disrespectful behaviour towards me for the opportunity to get laid and 2) I’m never gonna let anyone buy me anything again, because it creates unwarranted obligations on my behalf. 

Am I the asshole for not wanting to stay at the table and wanting to leave?

2753,"AITA for wanting our nanny to stay for an extra 2 hours on weeknights, so I can have time for the gym? My husband and I have a 4 year old daughter. We both work, so during the days we have a nanny come in. We still wanted to prioritize family time though.

I have been feeling really drained recently, missing the hobbies I did before we had our daughter. Back then; I'd do kickboxing right after work on Mondays and Wednesdays, and yoga right after work on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

And I realized I could still swing it, potentially.

My time away from home, work and commute combined, is 8:00 am - 4:30 pm. 

My husband is away from 8:00 am - 7:00 pm because he works longer hours and had a longer commute.

If I started going back to working out, I'd still be able to make it home before 6 or 7 every day, and still be able to spend time as a whole family. To be honest, when I have been getting home at 4:30 every day, and taking over from our nanny, all I've wanted to do was zone out. 

So I mentioned to my husband that I was gonna offer our nanny more hours during the week, so I could get to the gym. He went ""ok"" but didn't seem to be thinking about details, and he didn't ask any more questions.

So, for the last few weeks, I've been having our nanny stay till 6:30 every weekday, she's happy to have the extra hours and I'm enjoying getting back to my workouts. Plus I use Friday evening to do some grocery shopping alone because it's a lot easier than doing it with a kid in tow. 

I was casually taking to my husband about our monthly budget, which I manage because I'm better with cash, and how I was offsetting the cost of having our nanny stay an extra 10 hours a week. I had stopped going out for lunch as often, and I'd replaced some of our usual purchases (soap, TP, detergent, shampoo, etc) with bulk purchases online.

And my husband was like ""What, 10 hours? You said you were just going out to the gym sometime"". So I explained my schedule, and he wasn't happy with it. He said he didn't want to be the type of parents who push their kid off on a nanny all the time. Work is one thing, but going out for hours everyday after work was another.

I told him about how it made me much more refreshed and happy, the time I all home. So while I'm decreasing the time I'm home a little, I'm really increasing quality time with my family. Because I feel energized rather than drained. I didn't realize how much I missed working out regularly until I got back to it.

My husband thinks I'm being selfish; he doesn't like that I want so much time to recharge from family time. He thinks it should be fulfilling, not draining. 

And I'm honestly happy it is for him. But I'm an introvert, I like being able to spend some time just focusing on my workout and letting go of stress. And I really don't want to give it up, now that I've been doing it for a few weeks.

But at the time my parents were separated and about to get divorced, it wasn’t until 4 months afterword that everything was finalized. During that period my mom often told my dad that she loved him and I know she really wanted them to get back together so it was kind of weird to find out she had a boyfriend. 

My mom moved in with her boyfriend three months into their relationship and they started saying “I love you” shortly after that.

I ended a friendship with my group of friends a while ago because I believed they were consistently invalidating my emotions. Obviously this isn't the whole story. I'll try to be as honest and complete as possible. There's a TL;DR at the end.

One of my childhood friends (who's currently still part of the group I assume) told me he was going to play D&D with the rest of the group, all of which I also knew personally.

We started playing D&D and I noticed that I started to feel frustrated with how everyone was treating each other in-game.

I voiced these concerns to everyone but they were not receptive and responded with invalidation. Scheduling would be met with the same invalidation or passivity. I got fed up and left.

A few months later I felt that I may have been a dick. I approached one of my friends IRL, apologized and asked if they would have me back. They did, but with reservations.

Their current campaign had kind of bled out and they were gearing up for a new campaign. We started playing some sessions in the new campaign. The same things that were happening before were going on now. They were not playing collaboratively, they were not taking other people's characters into consideration and just doing things how they pleased or as they say in D&D: ""That's what my character would do.""

I yet again told them I was not okay with how we were treating eachother and I was told it was okay to do my own thing. The one time I did that, I did something rather drastic and immediately was met with rather intense discontent about how I was exhibiting ""anti-party"" behavior.

I started a new character with them. A few sessions later, I had an idea of how I (assertively) wanted to make a custom in-game item. That apparently went too far again. They decided that I was no longer welcome as a player in the campaign but they would still consider us friends. I told them I didn't know how I could be friends with people that consistently invalidate my feelings and how I still thought I was right in what the spirit of the game is.

The friendship ended there.

A few months later I came across a thread on a D&D subreddit talking about a similar if not the same situation. One of the comments basically confirmed I was right in how D&D is supposed to be played.

Now the question: *would I be the asshole if I approached one of my friends again and confronted them with literal evidence that I was right and that they were out of line for invalidating me like they did?*

Last time I helped them with a sum of around 25% of my monthly salary, my wife was angry at me. Her main argument is that I'm not saving for ""us"" (we're planning to buy our own flat) and that she doesn't have a say on our finances.

I got really angry because this was not her first time and told her that you'll never be able to manage the money I earn with this attitude of selfishness towards my other family. Also, I told her that even If I decide to donate half of my salary, she should support my decision as long as I'm covering both of us.

- I never said my wife is saving for our flat (it's not exclusively for the flat, but can be)
- I never said that I'm not saving (I'm saving at least twice as her - because of the income gap)
- I never pressured or even asked her how much is she spending/why on her salary. I even encouraged her to help her mom (she also needs from time to time as she cannot work)","YTA.

You suck for:

>Also, I told her that even If I decide to donate half of my salary, she should support my decision as long as I'm covering both of us.

""You get no say in the budget because I make all the money"" is a pretty shitty thing to say to your partner who is supposed to be your equal.

One suggestion I've seen when there is a large income gap is that you each get the same amount of money to do whatever you want with. Save, buy a car, home theater, whatever. Might be something to think about.

2772,"WIBTA if I read someone's private diary (sexual) without their consent? Lately, I've found myself in a tricky spot. I (f 26) am friends with this couple, let's call them Arielle (f 22) and Belle (f 30) they were together for two years, lived together and even got pets. But their relationship was so unhealthy and Arielle finally broke up with Belle about ten days ago. Well, Belle didn't take it well. She says she never saw it coming and is begging Arielle back, saying she's her angel, she'll change, and just focuses on Arielle instead of her own problems (one major reason for the break up, Belle couldn't get her life together). I'm trying to help both of them and want to stay friends with both, but a I've realised Belle's behaviour is very unhealthy and they still share their flat, which makes every conflict ten times worse.
So just now Arielle texted me. Apparently Belle left out her private diary and Arielle read all of it. She's panicked and saying how Belle's going crazy , obsessed, watching her in the flat while relieving er... certain intimate moments  and how she doesn't feel save anymore. I immediately asked her to come over and spend the night and... she send me pictures of the diary. Up until now I tried to stay nutral and told both of them that I want them to be happy and I think it's better for them to be separated. What Arielle talks about sounds like abusive behaviour and I think in that case she need someone to support her completely. On the other side, I don't want to betray Belle because I wouldn't want anyone to read my intimate diary , I know she isn't in a good place right now and I don't want to judge her on that, especially since she's in therapy and trying to get back on track.

I don't understand why she's held onto it for so long; she bought her new car three years ago and this old one has been molding in our yard ever since. Nonetheless I'm grateful we still had it around! My brother (17) was supposed to get it when he got his license, but because I also needed a car, the two of us were sharing it. In order to get it running, he spent $170 at the mechanic and I spent another $80 getting it tagged & $120 on an alternator, and $100 on a new battery. My lovely friend & I put in 5 hours getting it running. My brother and I paid for all gas and the insurance. My mother has done nothing for that car in years.

Fast forward a month: the car gets rear ended when my brother is headed to a friend's. It's the other parties fault; the car is totaled. Insurance offers my mother $2100. She's going to give us back the money we put in it, but my brother and I think that since we had done all the maintenance to it, we should get it. I should mention that my father was previously the one who bought new tires, a new radiator, changed the oil, and did all the maintenance for the entire life of the car up until now and he also argues that we should get the money.

I have two adult children who are close in age (my daughter is three years older than my son). When they were growing up, my son was extremely sensitive. His father always tried to toughen him up and make him act like a man, which I thought was horrible and sexist. I couldn’t reason with him, so I tried instead to nurture his sensitivity and treat him with a lot more comfort and gentleness than I would otherwise treat any kid.

I homeschooled both kids. My daughter was always very academically gifted, and also three years older, so she was usually a lot further ahead than my son. My son was often jealous of his sister and felt badly about himself because he couldn’t compete. To try and curb this, I gave him extra praise whenever he did a good job on something, and I downplayed my daughter’s achievements, telling her not to make a big deal so that her brother didn’t feel bad.

They are both adults now and I have a great relationship with my son, but my daughter doesn’t speak to me anymore.

Since I have been here (about 6 months), the fridges have been completely dysfunctional. No rules, no set spaces. People just throw what they want in there, wherever there is space. Things are rotting in all three fridges. Half empty bottles of sauces clog the shelves. Empty pizza boxes. Honestly, it's embarrassing. 

I have no stake in the fridges; I decided early on to live out of my own minifridge which has suited me fine. The few of us who care keep trying to get people to clean out their stuff so we can establish rules, but it has been impossible to get people to move their stuff or label it. Some roommates we don't see for weeks on end too, so it's tough to coordinate. The end result has been dysfunctional fridges for months. 

I finally got fed up with it this week. I put a page-sized note on the fridge last Wednesday telling people to move their things out of the fridge by Saturday or it will be thrown out. I posted on our FB group saying the same thing. I talked to all the roommates I could warning them about it (maybe half). Most didn't even have anything in the fridge, all were happy that I was going to finally do something about it.

He told me that he was busy and that he didn't want to. I asked him to at least show me what was his so I could stash it aside, but he refused again, this time saying that he wasn't exactly sure what was his.

2806,"AITA for unintentionally letting my mom think my cousin is into pegging? **TLDR: I told my mom that my strap-on dildo belonged to my female friend. I didn't know my friend was dating my (male) cousin. AITA for letting my mom continue to have the wrong idea about my cousin's sex life?**

I (19F) started college this past fall, and have been hooking up with girls for the first time, though I'm nowhere near ready to come out at home. (My parents are religious but fairly accepting.) One girl, Bella, and I thought it would be fun to try a strap-on. I ordered one online in December with the slowest shipping option since I wouldn't be back in the dorm for awhile anyway.

A few days after I got back to school in January, my mom called with a very serious tone. She told me I received a package at their house with a return address she didn't recognize, and she opened it to see if it was something important. She paused to consider her next words, and my heart dropped--it had to be the strap-on. I must have put in my home address out of habit.

I panicked and told her that I let my friend Ashley use our address to order something she didn't want her mom to see, and I didn't know what it was. Ashley made sense as a panicked answer: She went to high school with me and stayed home for college; everybody always assumed she was a lesbian, though I never knew her to date anybody. I told my mom that Ashley didn't want ""the package"" anymore anyway, so just toss it and please never tell anybody.

My mom agreed that she wouldn't tell anybody, and ""certainly not Aunt Carol."" When I was confused why Aunt Carol would care, my mom sounded surprised. ""You didn't know Ashley is dating Matthew now?""

*Apparently,* Carol's son -- my cousin Matthew (20M) -- had a class with Ashley last fall. He's our family golden child -- athlete, honor roll, active in church, etc. Importantly, he's very much a male, and straight. My mom just sort of let the implications of what I said sit out there, and I ended this awkward conversation as soon as I could.

A few days later, I was telling Bella why we didn't have our toy yet. She said I was wrong to say it was Ashley's, since it could have been dangerous for her, and I didn't even know if she was a lesbian. And she said it was even worse to let my mom continue to think that, because either she will have some wild ideas about my cousin's sex life... or about Ashley, including whether Ashley is leading some kind of double life.

I think she's right that I was wrong, but in my defense, I was caught super off-guard and panicked. I said what I said because the alternative (coming out) seemed much worse and scarier. When I said it, I thought my mom might never even see Ashley again. And now that I have said it, I can't exactly correct it without coming out *and* admitting that I lied.

I don't think my mom will ever say anything to anyone, so to me, there's nothing really to ""fix"" here and only massive downside for me. But Bella is really bothered by it still, and it's been eating at me as well. So, Reddit, what do you think? AITA?","Yta.

2814,"AITA for wanting to help someone my girlfriend hates? This may be a bit long but thanks for reading. 


I (20s/M) have been with my girlfriend (20s/F) for two years. 


While she was in school, my girlfriend was bullied by someone we will call Kyle. My girlfriend is of Rromani descent, and Kyle would make racially charged statements about her, like she was poor and trashy, she got around with the boys and call her the g-slur (g*psy). He was generally horrible to her, and even outed her as bisexual in the ninth grade and caused her to lose a lot of her friends. 


I joined the school a bit late, and I was friends with Kyle. I didn't know about the bullying until after graduation and I was horrified to find out, but I still wanted to remain friends with him. My girlfriend didn't approve and wanted me to cut him off, but put up with it anyway. I kept asking her if she was willing to make friends with Kyle and put the past behind her but she said that she didn't want anything to do with him. I did tell Kyle off but he hasn't properly apologized to her yet. 


A few days ago, me and my girlfriend got into a huge fight. It was about Kyle. Me and Kyle were very close, and in the last two years of school, he confessed to me that he was a female-to-male transgender. I promised Kyle that if I had the appropriate funds, I would pay for his gender reassignment surgery as I knew him and his family were in a financial struggle. Yesterday I asked my girlfriend (who earns more) to allocate funds for his surgery and she blew up on me. She was furious at Kyle for being entitled to her money despite the fact that it was my idea, and she refused to give him anything. I begged her to change her mind and let go of her grudge and said that Kyle was a different person now, but she got even more angry. I told her that while I don't excuse Kyle's actions towards her, he was a good friend to me and I owed him a lot, she began screaming and now she won't talk to me. 


I don't know what to do. Kyle was always there for me in the dark times and I made a promise to him. He doesn't deserve to suffer like this. But my girlfriend doesn't want me to forgive him or even interact with him. 


TL;DR I found out that one of my good friends was formerly a racist and homophobic bully to my girlfriend, I promised to help him financially and my girlfriend says that she will leave me if I give him as much as a dime. ","Massive YTA.

2819,"WIBTA if I gave a B&B host a bad review? So me and my girlfriend are traveling in Europe and so far had great hosts wherever we went.
We slept in many different places and in some places the hosts asked us in advance to know when we will arrive specifically, because they don't live close to the B&B.

Regarding the place in question, we spoke with the host 3 days prior to our arrival, to ask general questions, and she asked us when we will arrive, to which I replied around 18:00, and just to be clear I didn't think any of it, since the check in time in her booking page is set between 14:00-19:00.

Today we arrived to the place after a 4 hour drive at around 17:00. No one answered the door so we called her asking where she was. She said that no one is inside and that because we said we would come at 18:00 that's when she will be there. We were confused because we trusted thr check in time written on the web page. She suggested to just wait an hour. This made us a little bit mad but there was nothing we could do so we made some errands and returned to the apartment after she told us she arrived at around 18:15.

Shortly after she showed us the room and place, she said that it was our fault that we didn't send her a message about our plans, and it was too bad that we just waited for an hour and it was our problem at the end. I told her that we just trusted what's written on the web page and it's not really only our problem because it affects the review we give her at the end. This made her angry and she started arguing with us that's it's our fault and that we are in the wrong. Basically I told her that even if we are in the wrong she shouldn't be talking that way because it just isn't good hospitality.

They have a maid who comes and tidies up for a bit every day. 

My family isn’t broke, but we’ve never had people working for us, and it made me super uncomfortable. Like, who am I to have someone serving me and cleaning around me while I sit there? I can’t imagine if my mom were witnessing that. She’d flip. 

So I got up and started to help her tidy up. She thanked me for the help and told me I really didn’t have to worry about it, but I told her it was no trouble (it really wasn’t, we were just sitting watching TV.) 

Later that night my girlfriend’s parents asked me not to help the maid clean because it was a boundary thing and her work was her work and guests are guests. I told them it made me really uncomfortable to have someone clean around me and they just said not to worry because she’s paid well and has been with them a long time. 

The next day it happened again and it made me so uncomfortable I said “hey let’s go outside” to my girlfriend but she was busy on her laptop. So eventually I couldn’t help it, I had to jump up and help her out. 

Her parents walked in and looked pissed and my girlfriend finally clued in and ushered me outside. 

I’m still so confused by the situation. I’m not sure if I was in the wrong for helping her clean or if I’m in the wrong now for not helping her. 

My instinct is to help, but when I do people get pissed, so, if you understand the dynamic better than me, please clear this up. 

Am I the asshole for helping her clean?","You're not really a true AH (just more naïve by the sounds of it) but for this sub and this situation, yeah YTA.

**Her parents asked you to respect their boundaries and you proceeded to actively disrespect them.** Which definitely makes you look not that good in your girlfriend's parents' eyes. For many reasons. You probably (read: very likely) also made the maid feel uncomfortable. Also honestly, wtf, why would you not respect your girlfriend's parents? 

It's her job, let her do it. She likely has a system for how she does things and you more than likely disrupted that.

Just because you think you're helping, doesn't mean you actually are.

You wouldn't get up in a plane and start helping the air hosts? Or hotel maids? Or anyone in the service industry?

This is how I felt when working in the restaurant industry; Lots of customers would try to ""help"" in different ways, such as taking drinks off my tray and passing them around. However I would balance the tray in a certain way, adjusting it to how I took items off. Suddenly taking the drinks off would cause an imbalance, and most likely result in spilling the rest of the drinks over someone, or at the very least me having to suddenly get rid of what was in my other hand to prevent the tray from tipping. Then I have a new mess to clean up.

You are causing an imbalance at her work. AH move, even with your ""good"" intentions 

Another scenario; if her parents invite you over to a catered dinner, would you try ""help"" the caterers? (I hope your response is ""of course not"")

Also why did you girlfriend have to leave with you?

But it would help you if you tried to get used to it, as well as help your relationship with her parents (which obviously would help your relationship with your girlfriend).

ETA Also this is all coming from someone who gets it. My family is very frugal, and everyone needs to pull their weight. However, my parents started earning much more and being home less in my early teenage years. Household help was the best solution, that way they didn't have to stress about basic cleaning etc. When they were home they could focus on just enjoying family time, instead of stressing about chores. Reduced stress for not only my parents, but their children as well. Having household help allowed us to spend valuable time with each other. They were always really friendly with the people they employed, even going as far as to help with their medical costs, social security etc. It took me a while to get used to it, but honestly it just comes down to accepting that all people have different jobs, and respecting that.

Edit #2: clarifications

Edit #3: your actions more than likely sent the message to your girlfriend's parents that you don't agree with them having household help. Even further disrespecting them.
Get used to the fact that all people have different jobs. Respect your girlfriend's family, and their employees.

2842,"AITA for rounding up the neighbors vines that were taking over our property? My neighbor caught me this morning walking out of the house to politely ask that I did not spray round-up on the vines that were aggressively taking over our property. The vines were coming on our property enough that I had to trim them back multiple times because they were tangling up my lawn mower and weed whacker, while also aggressively wrapping around my utility trailer to the point I had to cut back everything to even move it. Vines are fairly aggressive, I lightly sprayed them with round-up to hopefully stunt their growth for the rest of the summer.

The neighbor has a big koi pond that he apparently breeds his own koi. It is close to the fence on his side maybe 2-3 feet back. I know this and always have known this. He reminded me of the pond and the cost of his fish ($10,000). I know the cost of pond fish especially the large ones like he has. I took special care to not get the round-up in his pond. I didn't spray in the wind, and I didn't spray directly on the fence but instead at an angle. He mentioned that some of the vine died on his side of the fence. I can't see really his side but I have no reason to think he lied to me.

He then look over at our property stake (put in a couple of weeks ago.) and mentioned the fence and the vines were still all on his property and that I should simply enjoy the flowers. He did not become rude or aggressively and in fact was friendly the entire time. The concern was mostly around the pond and the fish.

I feel that maybe I was an asshole and should have trimmed them instead of spraying them. I only spent a few seconds spraying in that area. But I also feel that he could maybe better maintain the vines which would've prevented this entire situation. I do not like vines and I don't care for the little flowers that they put off (they haven't on my side.). It caused me nothing but a hassle every time I cut my grass.

He also mentioned that he watched me spray the round up. If that were the case why not come out and mentioned something to me?

Edit: Just to note the fence runs along my back yard and is maybe 1-2 inches from my property line. The pond sits back maybe 2-5' or more from the fence, best guess. The vines are definitely in my yard.

Reddit, AITA?  


UPDATE: Thank you Reddit for the opinions and discussions. I'll talk to the neighbor and figure out how he wants to maintain it. According to Google maps the pond sits back 10', way more than I originally said.   


I think the best solution is for the neighbor to maintain on his side so that it doesn't over take my yard. Either way, I'll have a discussion with him and we'll resolve it in a civil matter. Thank you and have a great day everyone!","Roundup can kill the entire plant, not just the part of it you spray. That's what it's designed to do.

You could have talked to the neighbor asking hi to cut back the vines. You could have cut back the vines more agressively. YOu needn't kill the whole plants. Especially if you're risking property damage in the process. 

And lastly, the vines were all on his property anyway? None of your business if they are.

2843,"AITA for only wanting a biological child? Wife and I have always been on the fence regarding children but now that we are both in our mid-30s, with established careers and all, we are slowly swinging towards the ""yes"" camp.

I would very much like biological children. My wife, on the other hand, is strongly against this: she says it's either adoption or no children at all. It's not an ultimatum, she just says she doesn't want to go through pregnancy (I'll elaborate on her reasons below) and if she had, she would rather we not have any kids. For me, it's the same thing: I either want children that are ""our own"" (not that an adopted kid would be anyone else's) and would rather not have kids, if we had to adopt.

My POV: I want them to look like me and my wife, I want them to share our genes and be our ""legacy"" in a sense. We both have some shitty genes, but nothing out of the ordinary (I've got bad teeth and they run in the family and my wife's entire family has some sort of near-sightedness - from 0.5 to around 4.5 diopter). She's 32 so age is not a problem (her mom had her at 36, her grandmother had her mom at 34, they're late bloomers).

Wife's POV: She has tokophobia (doesn't like the thought of pregnancy), is scared pregnancy will ruin her body (her mom had terrible vomitting and was on bed rest since 1st trimester), and has environmental reasons (over-population, taking an abandoned kid in, etc.

I'm aware her reasons sound far more ""morally just"" than mine. But I don't think she's taking into account complications of adoption, e.g. if we go for open adoption, we have to essentially maintain contact with the parent/other family, what about half-siblings, adoption can be expensive and time-consuming, we might have to financially support a lot of new mothers only for them to bond with and decide to keep the baby\*, etc.

\*On this note, my wife actually wants to adopt a toddler/a young child. She is worried a baby would have a devastating effect on our relationship and an older childer may make for an easier transition, given that none of us would be a SAHP (we will do flexible work arrangements with half-days, 1 day from home, babysitting, etc).

She says I'm TA because in the end, it's her body that will need to be sacrificed (pregnancy, breast-feeding, potential complications) and her career that would be on the line (as a baby, especially a biological one, would require much more investment from both of us and naturally, as the mother, she would be expected to do those sacrifices). I think I'm NTA because, for me, biology is the dealbreaker - I want a mini ""us"", and yes, it's selfish, but I think I will connect better with someone who shares my genes and the genes of my best friend (my wife in case there's any doubt).

P.S. I know surrogacy is the logical solution here, but unfortunately, we don't have the funds for a surrogate, but most importantly, where we live this isn't really done (so it will have to be done illegally, which is scary, dangerous and not something we are willing to risk).","YTA based on the fact that you called tokophobia not liking pregnancy, that is the understatement of a century. 

You want bio kids, have them with someone else. Because with bio kids comes the risk of your wife dying. Your wife is correct, it's her body and it's her life she will be risking. You do not get to demand she has bio kids.

My grandpa is an old man in his mid 70s. In general we get along very well. He likes westerns, i like westerns, so one day we started talking about the movie 'Tombstone'. Spoilers below.

He is convinced that Doc Holiday lived through the movie. 

Doc Holiday clearly died in said movie. Bedridden and dying of TB, he tells Earp to go on and live without him, then repeats his final line ""This is funny"" then breathes his last breath and stares blankly into the camera which fades out. These were the real Doc Holidays last words and manner of death.

My grandpa is convinced that he lived in said scene, stating his eyes never closed and references an earlier scene where Doc runs out of bed to help Wyatt. This is an earlier scene, yet he thinks its after the previous scene and that Doc lived to the end.

I show him Doc death scene and the wiki page on the real Docs death and his last words. His response is ""WELL SO WHAT, ANYONE CAN SAY ANYTHING."" which makes zero sense.

I am pretty worked up and press him about it and he says ""I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. IVE SEEN THE MOVIE."" I respond ""IVE SEEN THE MOVIE TOO AND HES DEAD GRANDPA!""

Recently my girlfriend had asked me if we could go to our local shelter to look at dogs, we both love dogs and we were thinking of getting one In the future after we were better established, as we just moved into our apartment which before we lived in our apartment we lived with our parents. 

But anyways we went to the pet adoption agency and decided to adopt a pit bull named billy who is absolutely the best dog ever, when we saw him we knew how amazing of a dog he was but because of this I feel like we made a knee jerk decision and decided to adopt him. 

We have gave it some thought after we adopted him which we only adopted him 2 days ago and with our college schedule and our work schedules of varying hours to the point were one of us is always going to be gone or both of us at the same time, as well as our college schedules coming up and the fact that we live in a small apartment where he has almost no space to play and roam and have fun. We just can’t figure out if he’s suffering or he’s okay with it, and we don’t know how it’ll be in the future for him. 

At this point we have decided that if he continues to live with us he may end up suffering more than being with a family that has a yard and he’s such a sweet dog I don’t think he’d have any trouble finding a good family hopefully.  Me and my girlfriend are just so scared of psychologically scaring him and him going to the wrong family.

 HR and I have always been kinda close even when they were dating we were all best friends. At the time i kinda had romantic feelings for her but they weren't strong enough for me to like do anything about it and since they were dating i was like duh no chance but i was fine with that because I was doing my own thing and exploring myself I wasn't in a state to have a relationship at that time but do keep in mind I was not the reason they broke up.

Now I told some people in our friend group and was met with immediate backlash with them saying how awful I am, that I shouldn't be doing this, and how that I'm only doing it to cause drama which is not the case.

I like to have some quiet time with a cup of coffee and catch up on the news/reddit/reading before I have to talk to people.

Once in a while, if we’re staying with people or have overnight guests, I’m happy to have breakfast all together. The issue is when we visit my boyfriend’s family for a longer period of time (4-5 days, or in the case of Christmas, 10 days). 

They have breakfast together every single morning. His mom and her partner will get up at 6am, put breakfast things out on the table, and wait for us to get up at 8-9ish. If they can’t wait, they eat and then come back to the table to sit with us while we have our breakfasts and boy are they chatty. 

My family tends to have the view that everyone gets up and gets their own breakfast on their own schedule, since everyone gets up at different times. Same thing with lunch, except if we’re all ready for lunch at the same time (my boyfriend’s family will again all sit down for lunch together every day).

Over Christmas, I felt really worn out from the constant socializing and feeling like I had no time to myself, and a lot of that was having to go straight into socializing when I woke up.

Every month we see each other less and less. Christmas is coming up and I wanted her to come over to meet my extended family and have dinner that sort of thing. She was down. But I didn’t have a present for her yet. So I asked her what she wanted. She didn’t know and couldn’t really think of anything, so I suggested that we could go out to the mall and look at stuff together. Then after awhile we split up and buy each other something. Again she was down. We decided to see each other the day after she finished exams, because at this point I hadn’t seen her in a month and just needed to talk to her.

Well time goes by and it’s the day before we’re supposed to go. We hadn’t really talked about how we were going to get there (we both can’t drive yet). So I asked her about how she wanted to get there. No answer for awhile so finally I decide that maybe tomorrow isn’t the best day.

She then immediately says it’s fine that we can’t go tomorrow. So we decided to go on Saturday instead.

She then acts like it was her idea to go out even though it clearly wasn’t. I tell her this and she apologizes saying that her brain is fried cause of the exam. Fair enough. So I tell her it’s ok and to go to bed when she gets home so she feels better tomorrow. But she can’t, because she had already made plans to go out with a friend after the exam.

For context: I am currently in Africa doing an internship and my sister is in our home country and has been mentally unstable for about three years now. All of our contact has been through messages sent back and forth. We both handle our problems very differently. I am a person who will apologize quickly, so I lash out once I truly lost my patience and she is more the person who will wait until something blows over.

So we have had a small argument about something insignificant a few days ago. I decided to swallow my pride and apologize to her. I thought I did so in a very carefully constructed way, telling I should not have done the things I did and that I was sorry. She did not respond. It might have been her way of handling the argument we had. Cooling down before sending a message, so that it would not be written out of anger. I decided to text my mom asking if I had done anything wrong.

As time went by, I was getting more annoyed, since I was the one reaching out and swallowing my pride. I did not want to show any of this anger to my sister though, since we have always been very close and me hurting her might sent her back into mental instability. I ended up venting a lot of my anger towards my mother and saying that I want my sister to apologize to me. She managed to calm me down and I went to sleep. 

This morning, I saw that my sister had sent some messages and I was secretly hoping they were apologies. However, These messages were just to show her side of the story and telling me she does not want to include our mother in our arguments. Then there were some casual messages afterwards to try and end this entire situation. This almost broke my patience, since I felt the only reason I included our mother was to protect her from myself. Additionally, she still ignored the apology message I had sent the night before. I sent one message saying that I did not like it that she ignored my apology, because I had to use a lot of self-control to type it. I think it might have been her way of putting this entire situation behind her and moving on. I feel that I need her to at least say that she appreciates that I apologized.

2876,"AITA for buying a spite dog? Recently I lost my cat. He was the first big “standard” pet I’ve ever had for myself. I raised him from a baby. There was a bad flood here recently, he got outside, never came home. I was devastated. I decided that I should get a new pet, but this time, I wanted a dog. 

I share a 2 br apartment with a married couple. They knew about my cat when I moved in, and I paid a pretty sizable pet deposit. Our initial agreement re: bills was that I would pay for half of everything, until the main roommate’s husband could get a job, at which point he would pay for his third of the bills. The unemployed husband spends many months out of the year working in his home country.

So, I tell the roommate who has a job that I’m going to get a dog. I let him know as a courtesy, not to open a debatez He tells me that he doesn’t mind, but his husband will. He tells me, over several occasions, all the ways and reasons why his husband will have a problem with me getting a dog. I tell him that his husband doesn’t pay any bills, and isn’t here over half the year anyway, so I don’t care to involve him in this discussion. This exchange happens several times over the few weeks to a month I am waiting to adopt one quiet, elderly Pomeranian. This doesn’t work out, and my roommate’s husband takes him on a week-long vacation to Las Vegas. As my roommate gets on the plane, he sends me a long text, essentially telling me that I am not to have a dog, and that once his husband starts paying bills, he will have much more to say regarding the dog situation.

At this point, I am absolutely livid.

So, I leave work early, and head down to the humane society.

When I say that meeting my dog was love at first sight, it feels like an understatement. I assume this is what other women feel like when they hold their newborn child for the first time. My dog immediately took to me, and I to him, and I spent several days having a grand time with him.

Then my roommates came home. Obviously they were upset, but the husband never said a word to me and the other roommate sent me a text letting me know that what I had done was unacceptable. I explained to him once again my earlier points: I was letting him know I was getting a dog as a courtesy, and it had not been open for debate. I had already paid a pet deposit. They had already signed the lease with me when last I had a pet, and they did not dictate what I was allowed to do with my own space within the apartment. That was the end of that discussion.

2879,"AITA for withdrawing financial support for my daughter's college plans as punishment for stealing from us (her parents)? My daughter (17) has an unfortunate history of stealing money from her family.  As far as I know she hasn't done this to anyone outside of our home.  It has escalated over the years, despite punishments being handed out (taking away car and phone privileges).  She has taken cash that's been left on the kitchen counters or my desk.  She once swiped her younger sibling's Christmas present, a target gift card, and emptied it.  She took the money that another sibling earned for a school fundraiser and had set aside in a separate envelope.  Essentially we've learned not to leave cash out in the open.  Every time she's accused of taking money, she initially denies it but then eventually owns up, apologizes for her behavior, and pays it back.  We don't really know why she's taking money that doesn't belong to her.  She has a part-time job and all of her school and extracurricular expenses are paid for.  I am 99.9% certain it's not anything drug-related.

Today while going through our main bank account, my wife discovered that she had somehow written three checks ($200, $300, $300) to our daughter over this past month and that she had deposited them to her own checking account.  When she examined the transactions, she found out that our daughter had taken the last three checks from the checkbook, wrote the amounts to herself, and signed my wife's name to them.  I don't know why she thought we wouldn't find out.

Her phone and car are gone, for sure.  Her social life is over.  On top of that, I just don't feel like doing anything to help her with college applications.  She has pretty much burned away any desire or motivation to help her out.  No money for ACT and AP testing and test prep.  Nothing for college application fees.  We had plans to visit some of the schools that she was interested in.  Not gonna happen.  She has been taking voice lessons and acting classes to prepare for auditions (she's planning on majoring in voice performance or theater).  I don't feel like paying for it anymore.  My wife is concerned that she won't earn enough from her part-time job to pay for everything she'll need for a competitive audition portfolio and application fees, and that we would be sabotaging her chances for getting into the college of her dreams.  She feels that it's only my anger talking and that the usual punishments are enough.  I, on the other hand, feel extremely disrespected.  My daughter has not wanted for anything in her life.

He explained that it was gutted and cleaned and roasted over a fire with spices etc. I understand cultural differences but I told him that he would be better off not bringing stuff like that at work as it could raise issues for the more sensitive people or at least if wants to bring it cut it up in pieces and leave the head at home. He wasn’t angry but he did bring up he saw people bring in whole roasted chickens without issue and he thought it would be OK (I’ve seen it too but I’ve never seen anyone bring an entire roasted chicken with the head attached).

2881,"AITA for calling my 4th grade student immature and calling her out on her other behavior? I’m a fourth grade teacher, and one of my students is very intelligent but a bit needy and always needs assurance. Her parents are really demanding in the academic sphere, and so she often asks me how well she does on tests and if I can check her planner to see if she’s missing any assignments that should be written down (missing assignments are penalized harshly points-wise in my classroom and she doesn’t want her grades to slip). 

Recently I’ve gotten really annoyed that she needs so much assurance as well as the fact that she’s always near me. I told her on Friday that I wasn’t going to check her planner and called home about her neediness and clinginess. The student told me that her mom yelled at her and said that “[the student] didn’t need to win [my] heart so she should stop acting like a pansy.” Okay. But the mom’s words have had no effect and the clingy behavior has continued, even during a field trip we had to a history museum. 

For example, she and her best friend picked the seat closest to the front where teachers sit, and I told her, “Great, you must be so happy that you’re sitting next to me all the way.” She kind of grimaced and started talking to her friend after I said that, but at least she didn't interact with me much at the museum.

My class has also recently discussed immaturity and behavioral issues, and after that lesson, this student came up to me and asked if she had ever behaved immaturely with a written note. I replied, “Sometimes.”

After that incident, she started crying and legitimately hasn’t spoken to me in days, making it really hard for me to interact with her as a teacher and for her to get any work done in my class. She's actually had 2 missing assignments recently despite her parents being harsh about grades and now has a B+ in math because of it.

To be honest, I’ve tried really hard to connect professionally with this student and get through to her. I know her favorite foods, songs, and hobbies and also know that she often argues with her mom and doesn’t have a good relationship with her mother.

My wife and i had two sons before we got married. we were both in our early 20's when she got pregnant with my oldest son. At the time she got pregnant we were in a ""friends with benefits"" stage as we had split up. Before either of us new she was pregnant i decided to leave the country and Travel for a year. It happened very quickly, from the date i decided to go to the time i left was less than  months. She was extremely upset when i told her i was going but we weren't together and were fighting a lot at the time. I really didn't see a future for us. When i was a few days from leaving she told me that she could tell me something that would stop me going, however, i never found out what it was.

&#x200B;

Turns out she was pregnant. I had been gone about a month when i found out she was pregnant. She told me to continue my travels and enjoy my year that the child would be there when i got back. I thought about it for a few days and decided the right thing to do would to be come back. So a few days later i was on a flight back. To this day i do not in any way regret coming home. We talked when i got back and decided to try work things out for the sake of the child. In fairness it was me who ended the relationship as i was going through a lot of things mentally (I had a horrible childhood), so i was happy to give it another go. Knowing i has a child on the way i went full steam into finding a way to provide for my family.  I got a job and fast forward a few years later i have had several promotions and was making good money. I was providing for my now two sons and wife but i was deeply unhappy. 

I was working 50-60 hours a week to make sure they needed for nothing. Then in 2016 my mental health issues spilled out and i became suicidal. I look back now and see that it was always there from my childhood just below the surface. I ended up leaving my job cause it was killing me inside how much i hated it. My mental health got worse and i was hospitalized for my own protection. After a very long stay in hospital and a lot of counselling and hard work plus medication and now i m doing a lot better. I know for those 2 years i was sick i put my wife through hell, her not knowing if i would take my life was extremely tough on her. She became the provider for the family while i was unwell and she still is to this date.

So now my issue (finally!)

&#x200B;

In September of last year i went to university to follow a dream i had since my childhood. The degree i am doing has a big workload. I had consulted my wife about this before i took the course and she agreed i should do it that we would make it work for the 3 years. Since i have started i constantly get pulled away from doing college work. I barely get the chance to stay late to study as my wife keeps taking overtime so i come home to take care of my sons. Once at home i try to study but the kids are constantly needing attention. They are both between 8-11 so they are big enough that i don't need to keep my eyes constantly on them but not old enough that they can mind themselves. I am barely getting a chance to study and i am exhausted trying to balance everything. As a result i am failing my course. I want to tell my wife she needs to put me first and do less overtime. She also constantly goes over to her sisters house leaving me at home saying the kids are in there rooms so i should be able to study. My sons been the age they are constantly fight so i do have to stop them and cant get to study constantly for a few hours.

I constantly gave up things i was interested in, went without so my kids could have whatever they wanted. paid all the bills so my wife could mind the children. I think it is time for them to give me the freedom to do the degree.

We recently had a chat about it, and I was told that my level of remorse and interest were null, and here I quote (not in english, but a translation) my dad saying “you simply don’t care that we arrive late. When prison inmates spend half their sentence, they get interviewed to check whether they feel any remorse for what they’ve done, or if anything has checked. You simply don’t care.” 
He then was about to mention something about drug dealers, which I then just said that I didn’t think the comparison was appropriate at all, and that if he really was comparing me being late to an act punishable by prison time.

To make the story short, I agreed that I could improve my interest in preparing and getting ready, but the choice of comparing me and my behaviour to a prison inmate in such a scale was a terrible choice of wording.

One of the main things she does is she coughs a lot without covering her mouth! When she does this, a lot of residents get very noticeably uncomfortable, especially when it is flu season or any kind of illness is going around. A resident cursed her out the other morning because she was doing it around their food.

Ms. Green has good intentions but yesterday she opened the door for a resident who isn't allowed outside. Some residents have on ankle bracelets that trigger an alarm if they go out the door. They can't go out because there's too much of a chance that they'll wander down the street and end up getting killed. Residents aren't supposed to be messing with the door controls anyway so that ticked some of the staff off.

Ms. Green also ticked off the administration because she contaminated the ice machine. In the employee break room is the ice maker that we use to supply ice to the whole facility. She went in there and stuck her bare hands into the ice machine. Maintenance had to come in, empty the whole machine, and sanitize it before we could use it again. This took a long time to do. The resident that saw her do it publicly told every other resident why no ice was being passed out so the residents went from being annoyed to being furious. These people love their ice.

Towards the end of 10th grade he started fucking up again. We took him to see a psychologist who was the biggest moronic the world. He said that Brian was just going through puberty and nothing to worry about. It wasn’t like he was using drugs.


As it turns out, Brian was smoking pot and popping pills. We pulled him out of his school and into a private school by his moms work. He thrived and got a partial scholarship to UCLA. He even got a job at a bike store.


He started slacking off again. He dropped out of school and quit his job. We cut him off financially but he always seemed to have money. One of his friends parents told us he was selling drugs at the skate park AND our home. We tore his room a part and found shrooms and pills. We kicked him out. We said we would be open to helping him if he wanted to and the ball was in his court. His last words were “fuck you.”

The next couple of years was his couch surfing and god knows what else. Currently he works as a seasonal mechanic at a resort.

To me, posts like these seem a little self-indulgent.

2910,"AITA for keeping using tinder in a relationship Edit: it was very useful to have a look from another perspective, thank you all for comments and questions to think about! App is deleted, conversation ahead

I (26f) met my boyfriend (27m) in Tinder like a year ago. For some first weeks I didn't really think this will work, so I kept using the app but soon just stopped swiping. We have also agreed on the concept of exclusive relations, as would feel uncomfortable in any kind of open ones. 

Apparently it became obvious tinder is a very good antistress: once I got mad at him or upset or something, I open the app with the initial idea ""oh, dear, you're not the last man on earth"" and close it soon with a great relief that my relations are actually very good and I don't need to go through exausting small talks and first dates again. Of course, I never try to match anybody or do it in front of him, only when I'm alone. I also share some nice guys with my single friend. So far it all looked as an ideal scheme to calm down and express my feelings in a constructive way.

But last week when we were in a journey, I showed something on the map from phone and Tinder sent push with some advertisement (you are in a new place, explore it! or smth like that). He looked upset for a moment but made some jokes on it, I've explained I sometimes discuss guys with a single friend (so, that's stupid but true) as I obviously can detect a nice guy, and we moved on. 

I wasn't feeling I was wrong until then. It looks like everything is good now, but I feel very bad as if I were him I would be upset too. Some part of me says I should stop doing it, but another is saying it's wrong as this thing successfully worked.

Ps I also feel this is kinda childish","YTA

2912,"AITA for dodging forced introductions to my family? Here’s the deal, I’m almost 40. I spent a lot of my childhood moving around until parents thought it was time to “put down roots”. My aunts and uncles having young families during that didn’t visit as a result I didn’t develop relationships with them or my cousins. There is no bitterness or anger here. However, there’s a big IDGAF about prioritizing “family” because we are related.  I’ve built a family out of friends and coworkers that has always been my core support group. My relatives do not reach out and neither do I. It’s been decades since I’ve talked to some of my cousins. This is Ok.

My mom however feels the need to interject me into every event. Here’s Cheerio! Ugh. It’s not fun. This often becomes a thing when I visit. I’ve expressed these boundaries and she ignores them. During a recent visit one of her 2nd cousins was in town. I’ve never met her in 40 years, but since Cousin has moved to my town recently we must meet! Keep in my mind visits home are generally overnight, and full of plans with as many people I can see.  There have been ample opportunities in the past to meet Cousin, but it’s just never happened.

So Cousin’s Aunt is on the phone with Mom and suddenly “Cheerio could stop by for a bit and meet her”. Aunt lives a few blocks away and Cousin is staying with her.  I asked why? Mom says she lives not far from you and she wants to meet. Today? I have lived in my house for almost two decades. Come on... “we’re practically neighbors so we should meet”. Needless to say I didn’t go over because I had wanted to spend time with my parents as I had plans in the evening.

Unfortunately next morning we run into Aunt and Cousin at one of the few breakfast hot spots in town. Greeted Aunt generally and kept moving as the hostess took us to our table.  I was reading on my phone and chatting with my parents when of course Cousin appears. And stands there like “Here I am!” I didn’t even look up. Continued reading while Mom chatted. Eventually Cousin said her goodbye and left. My Mom said it was awkward after. I put my phone down and went about breakfast.

2914,"AITA for not wanting to give back some items to my ex? I broke up on relatively good terms, as good as they can get I guess, with my ex in August. During our relationship we bought some stuff together:
- plates/bowl which are part of an ensemble. My ex also received a blanket as a gift, by me I believe, or my family.

After we broke up the stuff stayed at my place, and she didn't mention anything about it. 

There was other stuff as well, but I basically gave it all to her. I only kept a book and a drawing. They remind me of the happy times and I like to reminisce. 

So since she never came to pick them up, I started using them.

Now she messaged me saying she wants the blanket and the part of the plates/bowls she payed for (or that I have to pay for them).

That did it for me. I had been super nice about basically everything, and now after 3,5 months (and like 1month of relative silence) she comes back to collect the stuff. So I said, baffled, ""I find it quite ballsy that you ask me this now. I don't understand how you can care for this stuff if you only mention them now after such a long time"" and hurt I continued with "" if you still want the stuff I won't stand in your way, but if you do want to get them please buy my part of the ensemble because I think it shouldn't be separated. ""

I understand that the items are technically hers, but it somehow feels as an intrusion. In my eyes she had quite a big window to come and get them or talk about it, but she didn't. It's as if a stranger would walk into your room and claimed stuff you grew attached to. 

Now she isn't answering. So I was wondering if IATA in this story.

But one thing that’s gotten to be a little overbearing is her absolute obsession with her college football team (I’ll leave the school out to avoid any bias).

Besides music, sports are what I live and breathe for. Just like her, I take a lot of pride in my team and consider myself more than just an average fan. But last night we got into an argument when I invited her to go visit my friend and his wife in September and she said she would have to check to see if there’s a home game that Saturday. I expressed my concern that she wouldn’t be willing to miss a single home game (there are 6 in a season) for something I wanted to do together and she got extremely upset and said I was being too controlling.

We’ve both been out of college for 5 years and her old campus isn’t even nearby... it’s in the next state. I totally understand being a die hard fan of your team because I am one. But at what point in your life should you prioritize that less than your relationship? She says going to those games is a tradition among her friends and they always went in high school and college. But my thing is, yeah so did everyone else who went to a major school. She definitely holds her fandom over my head as if I don’t understand (even though my team has 8 championships and hers only has 2 or 3, but they’ve been more recent - just sayin). I’m rambling a bit so I’ll just cut it off. But I’m seriously struggling here because we didn’t really resolve the argument that well and it’s still bothering me.

Also you’ve only been dating for 6 months, asking her to change to plans and prioritize your relationship over her hobby leaves a bad taste in my mouth. 6 home games in a season isn’t a lot really, people who play D&D or are part of guilds in World of Warcraft end up with bigger time commitments then that realistically.

2918,"AITA for refusing to wash cause my parents keep asking me to do it? So obviously I’m a teen 15-16 and this is throwaway account cause I don’t want a friend of mine to see this. English is also not my first language so I’m sorry for the mistakes.

A bit of background:
I used to have a problem where I couldn’t feel when I needed to go to the bathroom. So imagine still being 12 and peeing in your pants and my parents never wanted to take me to doctor that’s specialized (idk what it’s called). I’ve also never really learned to regularly  shower, cause my parents never “forced” me too. 

Now, my parents have been contacted before by my previous school and now they’re constantly bugging me about. (Btw. my current school has not contacted my parents, because I’ve not smelled bad)  I get that smelling bad isn’t really a good thing. But they say: “You know that if you smell bad, people will think we’re abusing you”. It feels like if nobody would mention it too them they would give a shit about it. I ,ofc, shower and the basic hygiene stuff, but every time they mention it too me I don’t shower. Enough so they will smell, but not enough so deodorant can’t shield the smell. It’s gotten to the point that they expect me to wash every day. I find that stupid, cause they complain when I “waste” clothes. But I’m not allowed to wear the same clothes twice after washing. 

My parents tell me that I’m insensitive and that I’m just being rebellious cause I’m a teen (they might be right, but still). I should also do it so they don’t get in trouble. I’ve always been insecure about BO, but this just hurts more. I know this is kind of petty, but it feels right too me.

I'm a single parent, no other parent in the picture. My mother, who lives across the country, is very ill and go home to care for her and make final arrangements. I'll have to be there for about two months and I have to obviously bring my daughter with me.

I can't homeschool with this small of a gap. I've managed to negotiate with the rest of her subjects to get work to bring with us, but one subject is posing an issue: science. We'll be gone for the entire length of the school's science fair. It's not possible to just do a project from home, and completing a project in the fair is approximately 50% of the science grade. Going on this trip means that she WILL fail science. 

She's an A/B student, and was looking forward to a specific high school program that would let her graduate with an associate's degree and take special classes. The teacher can't do more than bump her grade to a D without the fair, which means that her grades won't be good enough for the high school program she really wants to do, but she won't be at risk of repeating a grade.

I feel sick about this but I don't really have a choice. I don't have friends that could just take her for that long. I can't homeschool.

Your mental illnesses can explain some behaviors,  and can be a push towards those behaviors

A mental illness does not excuse the behavior, make the behavior ok, or reduce the hurt that could be caused by the behavior. 

It may make sense to do something during a depressive episide- or even feel like you have no choice BUT to do that thing- like isolating.... that's depression, it happens.

2924,"AITA for turning my family against my sister before her wedding? For some background context, I (22) have a blended family with one bio sister (20), two stepsisters (25 & 28) and a stepbrother (30). My mom & their dad have been together for a majority of our lives (15+ years) so growing up we all became very close, spent all our holidays & vacations together, etc. I truly don’t consider them “step” siblings - although we’re not blood they are my family.

This past fall, my stepsisters got engaged. The younger sister chose me, my little sister, my step-sister, and her closest friends to be her bridesmaids (no MOH). However, my mom was the one to inform me & my bio sis that we wouldn’t be in our other sisters wedding even though she chose TWELVE bridesmaids - including her new boss, a distant cousin, and a college friend she hasn’t seen in years (her bio sis is the MOH). Although I’m closer to the younger sister, I was genuinely hurt that my oldest sister picked twelve bridesmaids but didn’t include us. My other siblings also thought this was a terrible move on her part.

Admittedly, I became a bit passive aggressive whenever the wedding was brought up. For example, my mom said I needed to wear a more formal dress for the wedding because “we’re family so we’re expected to be more dressed up than the rest of the guests” and I responded by saying “if my sister wanted me to be more dressed up than the rest of the guests, she would have made me a bridesmaid.” My mom & step-dad get upset whenever I say anything remotely negative about her wedding, but I think they’re reacting this way cause they were also hurt that my sister didn’t include us.

A few weeks ago, my other sister got married. At the reception, family members asked if I was excited to be in my oldest sister’s wedding a few weeks later, but I awkwardly had to tell them me and my little sister were not asked to be bridesmaids. A lot of them were shocked and genuinely upset that she isn’t including her stepsisters in her wedding party. Our grandmother (my step-dad’s mom) was especially upset since she considers us all family & didn’t understand why she would pick all those other people over us.

I’m not sure if anyone’s actually told my sister how upset they are, but I do know my mom & step-dad are pissed at me. In my mind this was a complete slap in the face and has permanently damaged my relationship with my sister (though we clearly weren’t as close as I thought in the first place) and I have a right to express my frustration and disappointment.

2925,"AITA for pushing my student with a phobia of swimming out of her comfort zone? So I teach swim lessons for kids, and the class I primarily teach is geared towards 4-6-year-olds who are ready to learn how to swim, and the end goal for my level is for the kids to be able to swim on their own for about 5 yards.

There is one girl, we'll call her Nora, who is 9 years old and in my class. Which does happen, as some kids that age just don't know how to swim yet and need to be in the lower levels to get started. So the first few lessons, I note that Nora is pretty scared of swimming. When I take her out kicking to the flags, even when I hold onto her, she'd close her eyes really tight and grip onto my arms instead of the kickboard if she felt like she was going to go down.

After a little while, I spoke with my boss and it was clear to me and the other instructors that Nora wasn't getting anywhere. What made matters worse was that her parents spoke to my boss after Nora's sister had been moved up from the level 1 class to my level 2 class. They basically told my boss that Nora shouldn't be in the same class as her sister because they feared Nora would become upset. Nora definitely wasn't ready to move up to the next class, but we couldn't just pretend like Nora's sister wasn't ready for the level 2 class either. So now the pressure was on me to get Nora to swim on her own and move on. I figured out some little steps in my head to get her started for next lesson.

Long story short, it ended up being a disaster. She was never in any real danger whatsoever, but she was absolutely terrified. I would hold her by my side a few footsteps away from the wall and tell her, ""Alright, you're gonna scoop and kick really hard to the wall now, okay?"" And she would dig her nails into my arms and refuse to let go, refuse to do a few scoops and kicks and make it to the wall. She was yelling, yelling for her parents who were watching, and it was a sorry sight. Trying to get Nora to do a back float was the worst part of it. I was holding onto her back, saying ""Nothing bad is going to happen to you. You're going to be alright. You're doing a great job right now,"" And she just cried. She was floating, but I knew I could not loosen my grip on her because she would start to panic and the situation would get even worse.

Class ended, and by that point, I made the realization that Nora had a straight-up phobia of swimming. She ended up calming down afterward and played with toys, and was generally in a happy mood when she got out of the pool, but I just feel so torn with myself. I feel like I've traumatized Nora, but I also did what seemed to be the right thing to do and I just don't know what to think about myself right now. I've never had an experience with a kid who's got a phobia of the water before.

My older sister (29) dated a guy when she was 18 years old. I didn’t know much about the relationship (while it was happening) other than the fact that they moved in together and that it was kind of a crazy relationship. I think they were together for a little less than two years and I didn’t hear much about him after they broke up. 

About 4-5 years ago she asked me to follow him on Instagram to see his posts, he messaged me and basically said he knew that I know her from my posts, that she is satan, to tell her to stop stalking him, and that she needed to move on. Then he blocked me and she just kind of laughed it off. 

Last summer she found out he passed away from a drug overdose and she didn’t really seem upset, just more of a “wow that’s crazy”.  It’s important to note that my sister is an extremely emotional person, and does not hide it. Then this year on the anniversary of his death she posts a collage of pictures of them together while they were dating with a caption on how he was so special to her and kind of acting like they had  still been close. It kind of made it seem that  he was still relevant to her life. This really caught me off guard because I would just never post about someone that I wouldn’t post about while they were alive if that makes sense, and I thought they weren’t cool like that because of the way he reacted when I followed him. 

Aside from her never expressing those emotions before, it holds true to me that it’s inappropriate to post about someone who dislikes you or you no longer are close with, so I asked her about it out of genuine curiosity thinking maybe they had reconciled since the time he had sent me that message on Instagram. She got defensive and said that “he was the love of her life (news to me?)” and he only hated her because she broke his heart. She had never told me she was the one who ended it before, and I didn’t get that impression from him. I don’t think it’s odd that she is sad he lost his life, just to post about it publicly came out of left field and I was wondering where it came from because she never talks about him and like I said she is not shy about her feelings.

2947,"AITA if I don't replace my brother's coat that my son lost? I know how it sounds from the title, but hear me out. 

For background, my son (13) has ADHD. Not the hyperactive type that people associate with it, but the lack of concentration/attention span that would have previously been diagnosed as ADD. It means that he has memory issues, and struggles with forgetting/losing things. And no, this is not going to be an ""I shouldn't have to replace it because of his ADHD"" kind of post. I would never let him use his diagnosis as an excuse for things. That would definitely make me the asshole. It's just relevant to what happens next.

Onto the story...

For Bonfire night, my family decided we were going to see a fireworks display. The day of the event rolls around and my train home was delayed so my son was asked to get himself ready by a certain time. He was told to put a coat on, but in the rush to leave the house, I didn't notice that he'd put on a hoodie instead of a coat.

By the end of the fireworks display, it's started raining. My son is getting soaked, he's miserable, so my brother lets him wear a coat of his. Said coat is North Face, so cost my brother £100ish. So not something cheap, at least not to me who is used to paying high street prices.

We leave the venue, everyone says their goodbyes and I tell my son to take the coat off. My brother said no, he could wear it home as we had to walk for a while in the rain.

I told my brother not to do it. I warned him that my son couldn't be trusted with it, that if the coat was left with him, it would be lost. I'm 99% sure I even said something along the lines of I would not be taking responsibility for anything that happened if he took it home. I made it perfectly clear that it was a terrible idea. My brother insisted, said my son would try harder to look after, as he knew it was his uncles. I tried to tell him otherwise but I was overruled. 

My son came home with the coat. Which has now gone missing. Despite being told in no uncertain terms that it was not to leave the house, my son took it to school. He insists he remembers wearing it home, but we've turned the house upside down looking for it and it's nowhere to be seen.

My brother is furious and wants it replaced. I have no problem with that. My brother was going to give me money towards my son's Christmas present; it's now coat money. My son has £20 which he can have. But that still leaves us short. My son doesn't get any pocket money or I'd have offered my brother that too. I'm happy for him to have money my son is given in the future.

But I draw the line at paying for it myself. While I'm not struggling, I definitely don't have the money that my brother wants this side of Christmas. While my brother's belief is that he is my son therefore my responsibility, which in most cases I would agree with, he was fully forewarned of the consequences, and chose to lend my son his coat. So I feel that my responsibility ended when he decided not to listen to me.

AITA if I don't replace his coat?

ETA: The coat wasn't left in his charge, which a lot of people are assuming. It was put on a coat rack. Admittedly it was an oversight not to put it in my room, but it wasn't left with him.

ETA part 2: OK you guys, jeez. I get it, most of you think I'm the asshole, no need to downvote everything I reply with into oblivion!

Also, a lot of the comments have mentioned that I should pay my brother back myself ASAP and then recuperate the money from my son. I will definitely consider doing that after my next payday, but until then I just don't have the money. It's not a case of ""if I do it I won't be able to afford nice things"", it's a case of ""if I do it, I won't be able to afford basic essentials"".","YTA.

One of my employees (Dale) is pretty racist against Asians and Hispanics.

Other coworkers have complained about his comments such as ""hey hurry up, this chink ordered a burger"" or ""I'm tired of these people speaking mexican in here"" among other similarly racist comments. I've told him to stop countless times and he hasn't. He rants about how immigrants are ruining this country and asians and hispanics are stealing our jobs and look weird and so on. He usually keeps this rhetoric to the staff but a few times he's gotten into altercations with customers who've then complained to me. He almost got into a fight with a hispanic customer after saying wetbacks should be deported and sent back to mexico or something like that. I had to intervene to stop the fight from happening.

Yesterday he told an old vietnamese man that he should stop blocking the doorway or he'd pour some agent orange in his next cocktail instead of politely asking him to move.

35 year High School Class reunion was not planned 4 month into the new year, so on the old 30 year class reunion Facebook page I asked if we could start planning one. I have always lived out of town & never could attend one, until now. The original 2 woman who planned the 30th reunion stepped up and agreed to help; and 2 other woman from my class volunteered. We held meeting at my store, but not all showed up ( which was OK since we all group text after every meeting), I suggested getting donations from other business like my own to make gift basket & auction them off at the Friday night meet and greet at a local bar. I thought the money could be donated to our old high school. I contacted a local bar (which we agreed on) and even gave them my credit card in case someone walked their tab on that night, so that part of the reunion was planned by me. I put together from my store a $287.00 basket. The next meeting the original 2 planner of 30th, pretty much glossed over the whole idea and wanted to keep it simple.

I was forced to close my store & move to a new job offer out of state. I group texted, I needed someone to pick up the basket I made. I told them in detail on how to go about it; I even called the bar to make sure a small table & table cloth was put by the entrance, all my fellow planner had to do was bring paper, pen, a vase and the gift basket.

Now, this is not a topic that I’ve broached with him before.

However, it came up in conversation today with my stepdad. He claims that I was being rude by stating my opinion that there aren’t enough pigs in blankets. That I was out of order for not keeping it to myself, and that I clearly lack empathy and that’s why I can’t see it’s rude.

Now, I am socially inept and maybe I am totally wrong and I was being rude. But if I was, I don’t understand, I didn’t say it in a rude way.

We married, and are living very far from our families. Everyone here knows us as husband and wife, which we are enjoying. I found work. Both our jobs are very international and we are relieved that our marriage ensures us staying together is taken seriously no matter which culture we are in. Our parents still refer to us as boyfriend and girlfriend, which feels a little strange by this point.

&#x200B;

We've been married over 2 years and together almost 3. Lee's parents don't care at all about marriage, but my parents definitely do. They've been asking incessantly if he is going to propose. My mom is so excited for the wedding, is saying she has dreamed of my wedding since I was born. Originally I was counting on my little brother to fulfill her wedding dreams, but she now says it's ""not the same when it's your son. The wedding is about the bride."" We are feeling guilty (we didn't think weddings mattered this much when we did this), but also so thankful because a wedding sounds horrible and stressful (we are very very introverted), and the benefits of being officially married are coming to us.

&#x200B;

We talked before about holding a ""fake"" wedding, but we would hate it so much and it's a waste of money. We could tell my parents but my mom might be more upset than we originally expected about ""not being invited to her daughter's wedding"".

2979,"AITA for unintentionally spreading false rumours about my crush? This is probably going to get pretty long and convoluted, but bear with me. So I (14 yrs), for about half a year have had a big crush on a girl, let's call her Jennifer. So, I've never really had the courage to try and talk to her more often, I'm not the best in social situations, she's in the other class, and I've only been at this school for a year. But in the past month I'd started getting a bit closer to her, since she's really good friends with a friend of mine (let's call him Aiden), and we got along pretty well. So, a week ago my entire year group had a 3-day trip to a youth club in the mountains, and I kind of hoped to use this to become friends with her. But well, things went pretty bad.

Me and 3 others were having dinner at one of the tables, and for lack of something else to talk about, we started talking about the people in our year, and soon Jennifer came up. One of the guys at my table, I'll call him Tom, had only just come this school year. And he told us about a sleep-over party he'd gone to about a year back. By coincidence, the party host was also friends with Jennifer, and had invited her too. At the party, they'd played truth or dare, and Tom was dared to kiss all the girls in the room, including Jennifer. Then, later on, while he was trying to sleep, he saw a perfect view of Jennifer's nipples beneath her pyjamas.

He told us all this, and we just joked about it for a minute. Problem was, the other table overheard us, and Tom had to explain it to them as well. I didn't really think much about this, until an hour later, people came to me saying that Jennifer wanted to talk. It turns out that someone told her I had shouted out to everyone near, that William had kissed Jennifer and ""seen her tits"", something I never did. So I got pretty flustered, apologized, and then tried to explain it to her. It turned out that nobody had kissed her at the party, and that she probably went to the toilet during the truth or dare. She talked about this with Tom, and they said it was a misunderstanding and nothing more.

I went to bed feeling pretty shitty about myself. Even though I hadn't shouted out, chance was that the other table had overheard me first, meaning that I'd helped spread false rumours about her. The next day my friends said it was nothing to worry about, and I kond of forgot about it during the weekend. My first day back at school though, she didn't sit on my table in Maths next to Aiden, supposedly because we hadn't defended her seat. But then next lesson Aiden told me she didn't want to sit near me because she was pissed about what happened. I got kind of depressed for the rest of the day, and when I got home I texted her saying I hadn't shouted it out, and that I'd only heard the story from Tom. We sent a few messages back and forth, and the next day she didn't seem at all pissed with me.

But it hasn't really left my mind since, and I just want to know if I was being an asshole or not.",[deleted],1,YTA,0.0,,1
2980,"AITA for not wanting my fiance to go to thanksgiving? I am a 28 yo M, and my Fiance is 39 yo M. We've been together for almost 4 years. We fight sometimes, but not often and not like how we are over this. 

We both live in a city with no family around, so we didnt have any solidified big plans for Thanksgiving. On tuesday night a friend asks over text if we want to celebrate Thanksgiving with them they are thinking about hosting. We both decide it would be ok and say most likely yes. Well turns out they cant have an early afternoon meal like around 4pm because of working night jobs. So I find out today they are starting at noon. I work a retail job, and will not be off until 3:30pm. So who is the asshole... me for not wanting my fiance to celebrate Thanksgiving without me... he says just show up at 4pm... or is he the asshole for not backing out of plans for Thanksgiving knowing hes basically leaving me to miss the meal and celebration when we could just to have a great meal together at night after I get off. 

Hes asking me to show up 4 hours after the start time and one of the hosts will already be gone to work. In my head it seems like I'm showing up at wind down.

We just fought and during this he says ""do you really just expect me to sit around until 3:30?"" I think that seems reasonable considering I'm lucky I'm able to get off still so early from work.

2984,"AITA for not telling my housemate that one of my friend has pissed on her bed? Top 


So... we had a NYE party at our house with my long time friends. People attending to the party were also my housemate’s friends since we went to the same high school. 

My housemate (I’ll call her Sera from now on.) went back to his hometown so she was missing the party. People came, drinks were drank and people were drunk. Still everyone is in the living room and it’s not a whole house situation. Time gets and late and people are getting sleepy. The sleeping arrangement is three people on my bed, three people on Sera’s bed and another three at the couch. 

The pissy guy (Tyler) decided to sleep. Went to Sera’s room and falled asleep. Time passes by and another friend of mine that is going to sleep next to him decides to sleep aswell. He goes to the room, comes right back and tells with a shocked face “Tyler is pissing to bed.” Me thinking I would find a guy pissing on his sleep, instead I see a guy standing, dick pulled out, fully(?) awake guy.

We all rushed to the room, shaked him told him to go to the WC and he decides kitchen is the WC. We all go there aswell tell him to come back to his senses he insists he is already at the toilet and shows the bin trying to prove he is there. 

Anyways he goes back to his place we gather around the bed brainstorming about what to do, we pour flour and baking soda to the filthy places of the bed. Since we were also half drunk not realizing the side of the bed also was pissy so we pour it and go back to sleep. After we wake up we check it and the bed has turned yellow on the places he pissed. We vacuum the flour and baking soda and to our chance most of the yellow comes off with them but the sides are still yellow.

Let’s come to the AITA part. I don’t plan on telling my friend about the incident because it might cayse her to get mad (rightfully) and cause her to to ask me not to call my friends again. There’s not much marks left on the bed itself and I already washed the sheets. Still, there are yellow marks on the side and if we flip the bed I don’t think she would notice them. Also after the night Tyler apologized and said he can cover the costs of professional bed cleaning but the cost of it is roughly the same with a new bed therefore I don’t want him to pay that much. So if I don’t tell her what happened would I be the A?","Nobody is that dense, are they? YTA. Massively. Sera doesn’t deserve to sleep in a pissy bed.

2993,"WIBTA for asking my stepdaughter to give a curtsey knock before she walks into the house Quick background.  My husband has two children (stepdaughter 15 and stepson 13) with his ex-wife and she has two children from a relationship before she met him.  My stepson lives with me and my husband and my stepdaughter lives with her mother.  We get stepdaughter every other weekend. 

Ex-wife’s oldest son (OS) got his license about six months ago and ever since, he and stepdaughter have taken to driving around and stopping by our house randomly.  They also are doing all the pick-up and drop offs for ex-wife when it’s her weekend to have stepson.  The problem is that OS and stepdaughter never knock when they stop by.  They just walk into the house.  They have almost walked in on my husband naked (stepson was at a friend’s), did walk on me wrapping stepdaughters Christmas gifts and have scared the crap out of me several times because I walk into people just standing in my living room when I thought no one else was home.

I want to ask my husband to have his daughter at least knock to let us know someone is there before she walks in.  I’m nervous about it because in the past he has accused me of not understanding what it’s like to have divorced parents (true).  We got into a huge argument when he went behind my back and gave stepdaughter a key to our house several years ago.  My thought process was that she had no need for a key because there has never been a time that she was at our house with no one home (husband always picks her up for his weekend visits).  Also, ex-wife goes through a lot men and they always wind up living with her for a while.  Before OS got his license, these random men would be the ones picking up and dropping off stepson to our home.  I didn’t feel comfortable with a key to our house being accessible to these people we didn’t know.   Husband said it wasn’t fair that stepson had a key (he lived with us and needed one) and stepdaughter didn’t.  It was her house too.   I still don’t think “fair” is a good enough reason but whatever.

Now, I just want to know if I would be as asshole if I asked my husband to talk to stepdaughter about knocking first.  I don’t mean that she has to wait for us to answer the door, but just as a warning that someone is coming into the house.  My husband is very sensitive about anything to do with his kids.  If the consensus is that I’m an asshole, I just won’t bring it up at all and avoid the conflict.

Being a stepparent isn’t always easy, I don’t want to be the “evil” stepmom but I also think that it should be ok to have boundaries.

My brother is an alcoholic, and has been in and out of rehab for the last 4 years. It started when he got divorced and it has completely ruined his life. My parents support him financially because he often can't work, so when he is not in rehab he lives in an apartment owned by my parents close to where I live. My parents don't live nearby but phone him at least once a day to check on him. I am quite often sent to check on him when they are worried that he may have been drinking or anything. I have found him drunk many times and a lot of them my fiance has been there with me and sometimes she even goes by herself if I can't. Because he is drunk he has said a lot of rude, hurtful things to me and my fiance, including some creepy sexual comments about/to my fiance.

3002,"WIBTA if I told my friend to euthanize his cat? I have a friend who lives well below the poverty line and, due to having grown up with parents who kind of didn't bother, has pretty limited practical life ""adulting"" skills or knowledge. He readily admits this and often reaches out to me for help and advice that most people get from a mom or dad figure instead of a pal.

In the past my partner and I have also helped this friend out financially because through inexperience and poor decision making he has gotten into bad financial situations and was literally not eating for days because his food stamps were gone and the next check was a week away, that kind of thing. 
 
My friend is childless but has a cat that he refers to as his child. He babies it and talks about it like an actual child. This makes me kind of uncomfortable because, while I understand really really loving a pet, they aren't human children. They just aren't. 

Recently my friend contacted me for help and advice because he is in the hole to the tune of thousands of dollars (and counting) to a vet for emergency life saving surgery for his cat. The cat isn't recovering as hoped and fees are continuing to mount. More than I can help him pay and he's borrowing from everyone he knows as well as one of those veterinary line of credit things. Meanwhile my friend is not even living paycheck to paycheck because that suggests a paycheck would last him a whole 2 weeks without running out and it definitely doesn't. 

I understand how awful this is because I had a cat with a medical emergency that could have been treated by surgical intervention. I chose to have my cat euthanized because of the expense of surgery and the other financial obligations I had. It was gut wrenching but I just couldn't afford the cost of the veterinary care.

I feel that it is irresponsible of my friend to commit themselves to the tune of thousands of dollars they don't have in order to prolong the life of a cat when literally they can't always even pay rent on time and don't have money for food. However, my friend is justifying this on the basis that this cat is his kid and deserves the treatment he'd give a human kid. 

To me, the responsible and humane courses of action are either to have the cat humanely euthanized or to give her away to someone who has the resources to care for her medical needs. But if I tell my friend this, I'm pretty sure it will end our friendship. 

He has medical problems that make it a necessity that he eats daily but he is blowing that money on the cat instead. I feel like as a loving friend I need to make sure he doesn't starve and get even sicker than he already is but tbh I'm pretty tired of buying groceries because my friend won't do the adult thing.

Anyway, it has ALWAYS been like this but it really only started bothering me now. my friends looooove taking pictures of themselves and having these photo shoots whenever we are out. And I don’t mind a group photo or two but this is like a 30 minute affair with single shots and then group photos which take forever to organize and if we pass an attractive looking area we stop again for more photos. And it’s not just the photos, it’s the phones in general. We will be sitting at a restaurant and all you see is camera flashes and everyone down in their phones looking at the photos and choosing which ones to post on instagram later. Well, I started saying stuff, refusing to take more than like three photos,  trying to hurry the photo shoots along and asking for people to put their phones in the middle of the table while we eat and stuff just so we can talk.

Edit: Capitalization 

Edit: I think i should clarify that this issue of them taking pictures is not the most important thing in the world.

The problem came up when we were having a converstion and the topic of sexuality came up.  She mentioned she was pan (we werent the only ones talking, I already knew), and I asked ""so you're into everything?"" and she said ""yeah kinda"". the following went as shown:Me: Well do you like girls?

Me: What about guys

Her: no, not really. but im pan so i guess i do.

Me: Oh. (at this point i was confused.) Well what about gender fluid?

Her: What's that?

I then explained what gender fluidity was, and asked if she was attracted to other genders, such as non-binary. She told me she didn't know what any of those were, and lauhed at the description of them as if she didnt believe they existed.

Again, My problem isn't the fact that she isn't straight, it's the fact that she's most likely a lesbian (or bi), and she refuses to say so. It's not because she's ""testing her personality"" or whatever, she's been 'pan' for two years now. I know tons of people at my school who are bi, gay, pan, or otherwise. but the kids who are gay/lesb are generally accepted and whatever, while bi/pan people are bullied and sometimes harrased. i dont think she should be claiming to be pan when she isn't, and whenever she talks about it she always mentions how she's unique because of it, as if it's a quirky little personality trait. it's as if she's only pan so she can be different than other girls.

3013,"WIBTA if I sneak onto my sister's laptop? Sorry in advanced if this is poorly written as I don't use reddit very much.

For the past week or so I've been asking my sister for the family photos she has on her laptop because she is the only one who has them. I've even offered that she can just email them to me if it's easier for her. However she just keeps saying she will get around to it and check how many she even has. Now, she works full time so I understand her being busy, but I know she has had about 4 days off since I first asked (we live in the same house). 

I've been wanting the photos to have a xmas gift made for our mom and I'm getting worried that if I don't order it soon then I wont have enough time in case something is wrong and needs fixed with it. So I was gonna just get on her laptop and copy them onto a flash drive while she was at work.

I wouldn't snoop around and I know exactly where the folder is since I helped her transfer everything from her old laptop a few months ago. I'm just afraid that it will be invading her privacy too much if I do this.

So.. WIBTA if I get on her laptop to get the family photos?","YWBTA that’s an invasion of privacy!

Basically, I have this friend, we'll call her Cat, she is an army cadet and I think she's beautiful, smart, and the usual spiel that's guys say. We often play fight, mess around, she takes my hoodies, etc, and not to brag but majority of our class mates consider us the two smartest students.

In person I am an asshole I try to be nice but my anxiety and people skills literally make my flirts or jokes come out as insults but my friends understand this, and know that even if I do hurt them if it's intentional I apologise and if I don't they tell me and I do.

Well either way back to cat, she's just amazing, I haven't had a mental or physical connection like ours before (I have had past partners, I am not a ""nice guy"", I just, genuinely like her) and I, well I shot my shot. Of course due to my severe anxiety I did it over text at the end of our semester, that way if I got rejected I didn't have to act strong in front of our friend group.

Welp, she just, hasn't replied, when I text her about soemthing else or how she's doing, she replied and bam, we have a normal chat but when I bring it up, I get left on read and unanswered at first I thought ""maybe she's busy?

3022,"AITA for ending a friendship over a ride to work? I had a friend, Maggie, for several years in college. We had similar interests and would often hang out; I’d say we were pretty close.

One day in February we were getting coffee, and she mentioned that she worked at 6am the next day. Her weekend job was about a block away from my job, which was across town from where I (and she) lived. I drive a stick shift car that doesn’t have winter tires. It’s awful in the snow and my street was one of the last in the city that the snowplows went through. On this particular day we were getting warnings on warnings about how much it was going to snow overnight. We were supposed to get 10-14 inches, and I knew that my street wouldn’t be plowed in the morning, and that I wouldn’t be able to drive to work at 6am.

I had already asked my roommates and coworkers if they could give me a ride, but it wasn’t feasible for any of them. As soon as Maggie said she worked at 6am, I knew I had to ask her. She drove a small SUV and lived less than five minutes from my house. She worked a block away from me and would be heading there at the same time—there was no reason to say no to giving me a ride, especially because I had no other way to get to work and I absolutely needed to be there. 

Anyway, I asked if she would be able to give me a ride to work the next day, and she said no, because she didn’t want to add the time onto her morning.
This hurt and upset me, because I know I would’ve done it for her in a heartbeat. It wouldn’t even occur to me that I COULD say no to a request like that from a friend, because I’ve always assumed that friends do favors for their friends. 

I took some time to calm down (I assumed I was being irrational—who gets that mad over a ride to work?), and I didn’t really reach out for about a month or so. I didn’t explain how I felt because it seemed like it wasn’t a big enough deal to have an in-depth discussion about. Then, she invited me to go out on her birthday and I bailed at the last minute. I just didn’t want to see her. She moved away and I also bailed on seeing her before she left. I feel like I might be the asshole here, but my subconscious (which has never wanted me to end a friendship for something so petty in my life) is screaming that I’m right for not wanting to be in a friendship where the other person wouldn’t be there for me if I needed them. 

Should I be feeling more guilty than I am? I normally value my friendships really highly and wouldn’t do something so final or sudden. AITA?

We're now in crunch-time and the report is due in about a month. I've been fortunate that in my position I've had enough time to focus on this project while others on the team have been bogged down in other projects. As a result, my contribution to the report has been more or less completed for a few months. I've gone through a number of rounds of edits from the project leader and I thought my section was pretty squared away.

On to the story: I gave my section to the project lead and my boss a couple of weeks ago for a last round of edits. Last week, I got called to a meeting with the project manager and my boss. The project manager, whom I've become close with and I've never had a problem with him, starts saying that my section is incomplete, that I have ignored his edits, and that it's not right that he is editing the entire document and that I'm not seemingly taking his recommendations to heart. My boss is a perennial fence sitter, says basically nothing throughout the meeting, other than more communication is needed from both sides. I got rather upset because it wasn't clear that these edits were ""do or die"" edits and that they had ample time to discuss missing elements before now. Now, I'm stuck doing more research and adding additional content with the deadline right around the corner.

I will admit that there are parts of my section that I did not agree with edits on or thought they were addressed in other places, and I agree I should have communicated this more clearly. What I don't appreciate is the accusation that I flat out ignored his edits and that I wasn't as dedicated to the project and that he felt the need to bring all of this up in front of our boss instead of coming to me 1-on-1.

That was longer that I thought it was going to be. I try to not hold grudges, but when a person questions by character and work-ethic, I find it very difficult.

My child is 6. Suddenly she laughed and pointed at one of the houses. Inside there was a completely naked woman leaning down to pick something up right in front of the window. We could see everything clear as day. 

I know the woman, she is one of my wives friends. I laughed along with my kid as she clearly wasn’t bothered but inside I was a little WTF. 

I saw her at a coffee and cake morning  at school a few weeks later and she and my wife and I happened to sit on the same table. I tried to be as tactful as possible towards the end and say hey, Sophia and I kinda saw you naked a couple weeks back, maybe since you’re near the school it’ll be less awkward to just draw a curtain? 

She was very offended and told me I was being inappropriate and I was floored. I was even more floored when my wife agreed with her. I told my wife later that if it was a naked dude all hell would have already broken loose. She wants me to apologise to her friend. 

AITA? Am I going nuts?","I’m Scandinavian, so... prepare for some super european opinions, i guess.

this woman did NOTHING wrong. she’s allowed to be naked in her own home. blinds and curtains serve our desire for privacy in our homes, they’re not an obligation to be unseen. she’s fully allowed to be naked with the blinds open. if you have a problem with what people wear or don’t wear in their own homes, don’t look in their windows.

your daughter also did nothing wrong - curiosity is a cornerstone of childhood, and pointing and laughing is a pretty natural and innocent response from a 6-year old. she saw a naked woman. that’s totally natural. i guess america is different, but growing up, i saw naked women all the time! on the beach, in changing rooms, tanning on public lawns, and so on. it’s just... truly not a big deal. there’s nothing inherently sexual about being naked, and kids won’t see anything wrong with it unless you teach them it’s wrong.

you didn’t do anything wrong in letting her know - but i think the important thing for me is what you were hoping to achieve. did you truly just want to give her a heads up? or were you actually trying to say “The Children shouldn’t have to see that, close your blinds so i don’t have to bother teaching my kids that looking in people’s windows isn’t super appropriate, and can mean you see unexpected things”?

if you genuinely just wanted to let her know, so she could prevent it from happening again if SHE so desired, no assholes here.

They’re given for their looks or personality. For example, I am animal due to my crazy red hair. Anyways, he have this laid back dude we call Kermit since he’s full of wisdom, the leader, and cool. He recently got a girlfriend who is really sweet and she joined the group almost immediately. The problem came during lunch when we deemed her worthy of a nickname, so due to her dating Kermit, we called her Miss Piggy. When we told her she started to cry and asked why we were calling her fat. We didn’t know that she had body issues, which is what Kermit told us. So she thinks that we called her fat and refuses to speak to any of us, especially me since I first called her it. We didn’t mean it to be mean.

So are we the a-holes for calling her that, even if we didn’t mean to be rude or mean.

UPDATE: Kermit just texted me and updated me. He chased her down and explained to her about how everyone in the group has been nicknamed after the Muppets and that Miss Piggy is Kermit’s girlfriend.

She and I went to the same high school and had mutual friends but never actually talk to each other. She posted a picture of her and her friends in a group Halloween costume which I thought was very nerdy and cool, so I started talking to her. 

Our conversations went from cold and very one sided to very personal and we happened to talk almost every day, so I began to develope a crush on her. I knew she liked a guy beforehand, so I never tried a single move on her. Not even once. My crush on her wasn't so big of a deal after all. 

So, fast forward to this year. We have become good friends, and I helped with her Halloween costume and party, but then, in the middle of the party, I had this thought: Why am I friends with her?

She said I wouldn't like her answer, and that ""it would change the way you see me, which I would deserve"", and ""to think that it can continue happening in that way"" (that's her exact words, I didn't understand either), but that conversation happened in august and I let it go.

However, she managed to pry in and figured out what I was doing, which infuriated her. 

The reason why I never told her was that I wanted to keep my donation more anonymous and discrete. My wife likes to talk to people about what she's doing, to gain recognition about what's she's trying to do.

Before you go on, I didn't do this to simply one-up her. The supplies I saw in the store were on sale, and I was simply inspired to do something too. That's all. It wouldn't have mattered anyways since no one would have known.

I wanted to simply drop the supplies off and have the principal do what they wanted with it.

I have already asked some friends about this, and they are split 50/50. I am pretty comfortable with the idea of applying for “Arab descendent” scholarships, because I am a direct descendant of Syrians and Lebanese people.

EDIT: Thank you to everyone who responded! I’ve decided I will stick with Arab descent","Do you actively identify as Asian in your daily life? If so, go ahead.

But if you don't normally ID as Asian, in my opinion, YTA (or rather you would be TA) for claiming it.

The purpose behind scholarships for specific demographics is to give people a helping hand who are less likely to come from privileged or wealthy backgrounds and more likely to face educational and professional hurdles. If you don't normally identify as anything that the Asian scholarships specifically cover then you'd be gaming the system to apply for it when there are other scholarships you could pursue (as you mention above).

Being genetically 1/4 near-Asian isn't the same as having Asian upbringing or culture. Syria and Lebanon are technically in Asia but are as close to European as one can get given that! They may, or may not, be within the purview those scholarships were designed to cover. The same goes regarding your connection to those roots.

Since you say there are similar scholarships for women and disabled and queer people, these make a lot more sense to me for you to try for, alongside any other major portions of your personal experience (such as the Arab descent one, as that is definitely accurate).

However, this year I wanted to stop giving to other who can give to themselves. I adopted a family for Christmas and will be putting all my holiday money into that family in need. 

My SIL is a planner and loves to plan everything. She is the matriarch of the family. When I told her what my plan is, she told me I am alienating myself from the family and that I do not have a choice.

3044,"AITA for smelling like weed in a movie theater? On mobile, you know the deal.

I should start off with that I live in a Canada and weed is 100% recreationally legal. Also no ones ever said anything to me about smelling like weed or even gave me a side eye, its a complete non issue I'm just curious if I'm not being respectful of everybody else around me.

Me and my friends regularly go to the movies, around 3-4 times a month and we will always smoke a fair amount of weed before the movie.
We do our best to not hotbox the car and not absolutely stink but its weed, there's no way were gonna smoke and it wont smell but we do everything we can. When we're done the movie is normally starting in 5-10 minutes so we go straight in.

I dont know if this information is relevant but we also try to pick showtimes and days where there wont be a lot of people at the movie so even if we do stink there's not a lot of people around any ways.

The main reasons I'm asking this is because me and my friends have tickets to see Avenegers Endgame on opening weekend in IMAX on the first showing of the day in the best seating area in the theater so it's going to be absolutely packed and I was wondering if me and my friends would be assholes if we showed up smelling like weed.

3045,"AITA for not cleaning up the house for my wife's party? I also didn't change in time. This is my first ever post on this sub and I figured it's probably a good idea to use a throwaway so I don't give my wife another reason to be pissed at me. 

She was hosting a party at our house on Saturday. It was honestly more of a work event and she was super excited about it because she wanted it be our first ""mature"" party (meaning their were cocktails/wine as opposed to a keg, little sandwiches as opposed to pizza and our new hot tub was off limits so no bikinis either...I was joking with her that it sounded like the ""no-fun-arty"" which she found mildly amusing the first time I said it but the next 10000, not so much). 

So she got home Friday and worked until almost 2AM preparing and storing all the food she wanted to serve. There was some sort of work emergency at 7AM so she had to go in and I didn't even realize she was gone until I woke up at about 10. She texted me at like 5 and said she was having the most awful day ever and said she was thinking about cancelling the party. I told her that I would help in whatever way I could. She said it would be awesome if I cleaned up. 

I know me and my wife have very different cleaning standards but I very honestly did the best I could. I cleaned up all our mail that accumulates, cleaned the bathroom to what I thought was spotless, wiped down the kitchen and even started to warm up all the food she prepared. 

She ended up getting home at 6:45 and jumped right in the shower. Guests started showing up at 7 and it didn't even occur to me that I was still wearing my dirty cleaning clothes as I was greeting and chatting with her guests.  

She came out and in a stern ""mom voice"" she demanded to talk to me in the bed room. She laid into me like no one's business. I mean a brief laundry list of all my offenses: 

1. not wearing appropriate clothes. She didn't give me credit that I had been cleaning right until 7 because:

2. There was dog hair apparently everywhere, including the couch and there were piles of where it builds up next to the furniture. I had completely forgot to vacuum and everyone was getting dog hair on their clothes from sitting on the couch. 

3. I guess I missed some huge pee spots on the toilet.

4. I had missed her text that I needed to go get ice. 

5. I guess instead of warming up these salmon/cream cheese wheels I was just supposed to take them out but I put them in the oven and ruined them. 

6. and she reminded me of no-fun-arty.

Even with all that, the party went off just fine but it's Wednesday now and she is still made at me and says that my behavior and the jokes in the weeks leading up to the party show that I didn't even care how much it meant to her and my behavior that day makes her think I don't even care about her.

3046,"AITA for telling a co-worker to f*ck off after I told them I don't want to talk about work stuff during my unpaid lunch? So I was taking my lunch break at my work's break room when my co-worker stopped by my table to discuss the upcoming presentation we have to give for our project. I told him it can wait until after I'm done eating and we'll have a team meeting to catch him up on what he missed (he was on sick leave for a week).

He insisted on asking me questions and started showing me work related stuff on his laptop. I told him I don't want to talk about, much less think about work during my lunch break but he persisted. So I sorta raised my voice and yelled at him to stop.

He finally stopped babbling and obviously dismayed about it. I told him he better walk away now or I'm going to have to report him for harrassment. He let out an exasperated sigh and told me that I didn't have to be an asshole about it. Then I responded, ""if I was trying to be an asshole, I would've told you to fuck off the moment I caught a whiff of your tacky cologne heading my direction.""

He was taken aback by it and told me he's going to resport me to HR for hostility. I told him, ""fine. I'll come along too and I'll report you for harrassment and being under the influence whilst at work."" (He's a big weed smoker too. We live in Texas so it's a big no no.)

He just walked off after that. A few hours later I got an email from my supervisor that one of my teammates requested to transfer to a different team and that he's okay with it if I give my sign off on it. 

Yep, it was that dude. I signed off on that transfer request the moment I downloaded the PDF.

So am I the asshole in this situation?

Edit: Just to be clear here, I gave him three(3) chances to drop it but he didn't. I barely sat down when he approached me and I already wasted 10-15 minutes of my time telling him I don't want to talk about work during my lunch break. Based on the initial reaction from y'all, I guess three chances is nowhere near enough and that I should be a saint and waste my break just to humour the other guy.



Here's my response to that:

>Thats the thing though. I divided and delegated his duties to the other team members so he didn't have to be backlogged. We have a summary ready for him to read and the team meeting we're having was specifically organized to catch him up on what he missed and where we need him to pick up so we make the deadline. I told him this but he insisted that I show him then and there. I think me blowing up was warranted.

3049,"AITA for leaving my girlfriend at the mall? A little of the back story...

We made plans to go to the mall, and the first issue started when...
1.She knows I dont like going to places, and she asks me ""What mall do you wanna go to?"" I responded with a close one because I rly couldn't care less if it was something close, and her answer was ""But there is nothing there"" at the moment I snapped and said ""If you not gonna be happy with any of the mall the I choose wtf are you even asking me and not choosing one?"" And she proceeded to choose a mall that is 1 hour away, btw I am driving...

2. I am a very punctual person. I rather be early than late, that is one part of my personality and on top of it, that is something which the military always enforced. She is late by one hour, throwing my mood and patience out of the window.

So, we get breakfast and head to the mall, and we get there she starts shopping doing her own thing, and I am just following. I am not in a good mood, and there is absolutely nothing she can do change that after being late. After some time I asked how long are going to spend in the mall, and she replies she is planning to stay at least for 3 hours in total(2 more hours at least), I look at her and tell her that i am not spending that long in a mall, I dont have the patience to. She refused to find a middle ground, and she gets annoyed, tells me I can go home alone... I tell her ok, and gtfo. One hour afterwards when I get home she texts me and say ""did you abandon me at the mall?"" And shit just goes down afterwards. 
One thing that I dont get over is, why the fuck would you say what you dont mean and then think it is my fault?

3052,"AITA for calling out my friends wedding invitation? So my two longtime friends, one for 20 years, sent out their wedding invites which I got yesterday. Simple invites, addressed envelope with a simple single card inside. I happen to have a gf of almost two years. Both of my friends know her, have hung out with her, been to parties, dinners, ski trips, etc. My gf does not live with me. So I get the invite and its addressed to ""My Full Name and Guest"". The inside card was not addressed. This seemed odd to me, so I checked a bunch of wedding sites and they all said that couples invites should have both names, whether they live together or not. Or you send and invite to each person if you know both of them well.

So I text my two soon to be married friends, I thank them for the invite, tell them how excited I am, and then say that I was disheartened that they didn't include my gf's name on the invite. They are not apologetic. At all. They say that they meant no disrespect but that was the way they were told to do it by their wedding planner, that it makes perfect sense to them, and they see nothing wrong with it.

Fair enough, I respond that based on what I read I still think it should have both our names. The whole time I'm just picturing what would have happened had my gf come over the day I got the invite and seen that she was ""and guest"". I mean would anyone NOT be a bit bothered by that?

So my one friend responds again that it was so rude for me to even bring this up, and shes so upset that she's shaking. They also say a couple times that I was the only person that even got a +1 (we don't have any other single friends even dating anyone) and seem to imply that  I'm being ungrateful for the +1 by even bringing this up. Again, I just think of how my gf would feel being referred to as ""and guest"". I apologized to them again and say I meant to offense, and left it at that.

Alright so this whole story started about 3 months ago, in late september, in a night I was going out with 2 friends and 2 acquaintances (which were and still are friends with Janet, one of the two friends i went out with that night).

So later that night, my other friend, Maxime (which is btw Janet's boyfriend) and Simon, one of the acquaintance want another beer but are a bit short on money, which is totally normal as we are students. The beers are 6€60 (rather expensive but they tasted great) each, and i happened to have a 20€ bill, so I paid 3 beers for each of us, therefore lending them some money. The rest of the night went fine

The next time i went out a night with them was 6 weeks later, didn't really had the money to hit the bars before that. I kinda want my money back, since 13€20 is actually a fairly big amount for me (as a student, I mean). So I tried to make them pay for my drinks, and tease them on that since I thought the situation was rather funny, and Maxime went along with it. Simon, though, told me he was broke so he couldn't afford to pay me stuff. He bought drinks for himself tho, so I wasn't trusting what he said. In the end I only got 3€ paid back from Maxime and nothing from Simon.

About 3 weeks later, we went out again, and since Janet told me to insist to get my money back from Simon, I asked me rather quickly if he could buy me a beer (at 3€ a pint, what a deal). Once we all finish our beer, we move to a mojito bar, we all buy ourself a mojito, then we hit another bar which has a formula of 12 shooters for 20€. Once again I happen to be the only one with a 20€ bill so I buy the formula for all of us (Janet, Maxime and Simon). I tease them a bit about the money they owe me as I did last time as we play cards against humanity (for some reason the bar had this game). Then it's about 1am, so the public transports are about to stop till 5am, so we just leave the bar and go home. Janet and Maxime leave together since Maxime's flat is near the bar we went to, so I found myself alone with Simon. He wasn't my friend but I was like : alright, let's try to small talk with him, so we ended up talking about his flat, which was rather shitty (9m², common showers and kitchen). So I asked how much he paid for it and he told me he didn't really wanted to talk about it with me. I was rather confused by this answer and asked what he meant, it turns out he didn't feel easy talking about that topic to someone ""that close to his money"". Considering I was lending him money since more than two months and he was the one relucant to pay me back, i took it pretty badly and stopped walking and let him outdistance me to put my earphones on to listen to some music, and then I messaged janet and I was like : woooow drama, I think Simon really doesn't like me, and then i basically explained what happened. I talked about it a bit with Janet in class the day after since we are classmates, and since then, Simon doesn't really get invited to social events anymore and it kinda is my fault.

So am I an asshole because of that or no, it's been 4 weeks and I still feel bad about it","booze, and to a lesser extent, dinners, are sort of a special exception when it comes to exchanging money.  buying someone a drink isn't a loan, it's a shared experience.  there's not supposed to be a running ledger, it's more of a *you win some, you lose some* arrangement when it comes to nights out.  people who are constantly scrubbing drinks get called out eventually.  people who are known for their generosity receive their own rewards.  it's like you're trading money for social interaction, or lubricating that interaction with money, if that's more palatable.

you don't want to develop the reputation of miserly drink lord who remembers two pints bought and then one returned so weeks later you're still owed one.

I know in europe it's more common to do rounds, or at least in ireland, I don't know what the tacit drinking rules are for your area, maybe things are different.  but unless it's a huge violation of your local drinking customs, since it seems like you can't afford to spend more than for your own drinks (and there's no shame in that), I'd make it a personal rule to quietly just do it that way, and stay out of the rounds.

I tell her I like her

She tells me she lives really really far away.

I say AND I QUOTE ""I'm fine with just being friends you know?"" 

I tell her this again when she calls me. 

She continues to talk to me about whatever for a day or so.

Finally she says ""Where do you see this going""

and I say ""uh no where because we live really far away and this can't work""

She tells me to fuck off and that I'm a horrible person.


Now I feel terrible if she genuinely thought we had something but it's like WHAT DID YOU EXPECT WE LIVE SO FAR AWAY!? I probably shouldn't have flirted with her but I didn't really think I was you know?

I feel horrible but I want the honest truth did I fuck up?

3074,"AITA For Refusing To Get Off An Elevator? For background, I live in a medium sized but very dog friendly apartment complex. In this complex there are only two elevators and they are extremely slow. Not only that, but one of the elevators was currently broken at this moment so it took a long time for an elevator to arrive.

Now onto the story. So it was time for my two small dogs to go to the bathroom and I live on the 8th floor. I call the elevator to bring us down to the ground level since they are tiny dogs and going down 8 flights of stairs with them is pretty difficult.

The elevator finally arrives and there is one very large/ obese man standing there (for context , he was easily over 400 pounds ). He looks at the dogs and says, “sorry but you can’t come on, I have a dog allergy” 

I told him that this is a dog friendly apartment and there are dogs everywhere . If he really has an issue where he can’t be in the presence of dog hair then he shouldn’t be on the elevator period. He asked again saying that the allergies are severe and he has asthma . At that point I had had enough and told him that I am getting on with the dogs and they won’t go near him but if he has such an issue, he can get off and take the stairs . 

He was visibly upset by this and ended up staying on the elevators with the dogs until the ground floor. Once we were outside, we exchanged some choice words with each other and went out separate ways

For further context , I grew up with terrible animal allergies and have had to be hospitalized for them in the past. However, that was always around prolonged exposure of direct contact so I kind of doubt this guy was telling the truth .

Either way, Am I the Asshole?","YTA.  

Doesn't matter how fat the guy is. His allergies are apparently bad enough that he spoke up and expressed his concern with your dogs getting on the elevator. Maybe not in the best way, but nevertheless.   

The example of your own personal past experience with animal allergies is not the be-all end-all. I've got a friend who breaks out in hives if they enter a house that has a cat in it. Like instant reaction.  

Another person I know gets asthma attacks around dogs and cats if they're indoors in the same space for more than a few minutes. They've got a puffer they can take to avoid this but they need to take it half-hour to an hour in advance of the place they're going. 

You could have waited, or you could have picked up your dogs and taken the stairs. Getting on the elevator even when the guy spoke up and asked you not to and gave a reason why makes you an asshole. Asking HIM to leave the elevator he was already on makes you an entitled asshole.",1,YTA,0.0,0.0,1

This all happened a few years ago. Wife left her job and started at a start up. Fran was one of her old co-workers, and my wife brought her to the new startup,  they have since become great friends (part of our bridal party).

We just moved to the US this year and it is my son’s first year in school here, all of our first Halloween celebrations. 

My son is in third grade and has been excited to celebrate Halloween. I bought him a costume and we decorated the house and drew on pumpkins, I thought that was enough for him to feel he’d participated. 

I didn’t realize trick or treating was so widespread and thought he’d realize it was a tradition for some families but not ours since we don’t eat much candy, it is raining here, it is a school night, etc. 

Plus I am not very keen on his approaching the neighbors we haven’t met and running around the neighborhood after dark, even if I am with him. 

I told him tonight was not a good night but I’d go to the store and he could pick any candy he wanted. He is *hysterical*. I have not seen him this upset in a long time. 

He went to school and discussed this with his friends and five different moms called and offered to take him out. 

I didn’t want him eating a lot of candy and being exhausted tomorrow so just said “thanks but no thanks” and they were all very surprised and several asked “oh no is he sick” or “did he get into trouble” as though it was unthinkable he wouldn’t go out for this tradition.

So, I work at a hospital and was told that if I clock in up to 7 minutes after my start time, the clock would ""round down"" to the correct time. This is true. However, the manager did not tell me that -- even though I am technically on time -- I am still counted as tardy if punch in even *4 minutes* over the time. For months, she was silently recording my 'clock in' tardy times.

She pulled me aside to talk about an incident where I couldn't show up to work -- that happened once. She mentioned my tardiness, and denied that the clocks round down. But they do. She also didn't say she was officially tracking each one and building a case against me. Still, after that meeting, I always clocked in earlier (no problem for me...

3108,"AITA For Pausing The Wifi Preemptive TL;DR: I pause the wifi to convince my parents to replace their router because it inconveniences me.

&#x200B;

# Background:

I have pretty standard boomer/gen x parents (54 and 50) who don't super understand the whole internet thing. 

&#x200B;

I used to pause the wifi when my dad would try to send emails and complaints the to local public works dept, since I clear their snow while I'm home from college, and the plow drivers who receive the aforementioned complaints know exactly who is sending them, and which driveway to block in completely.

&#x200B;

After setting up parental controls for when young family members were visiting, I left them on the old router, where some devices would have free reign with just a popup on my phone, and others would be blocked completely. I left it on by mistake a year ago, and saw that my dad is a pornhub **fiend**. Particularly at 12:30am when my mom is finally asleep. He was blocked from the site by mistake on his ipad and went ballistic about me ""breaking"" the router.

&#x200B;

Turns out, I made the right call, because my old man thought that anything Apple was completely safe from every virus ever. For context, this is same guy who offered to match my savings for a college laptop, then took the money out of my account and got a macbook that was old even then, insisting that it was what all the colleges required. I installed windows on it within a month of being at school. 

&#x200B;

But, he got a virus, and it was far from his first. I realized that, when he ordered another new router, all the different ones we'd had were the result of viruses and his accounts being hacked, which he blamed solely on the router.

&#x200B;

The most recent router is my issue. He had geek squad choose and install it while I was away, and it is terrible. While before I would get something that was pricier, since we would have at minimum 7 devices all connected between just my parents, it was usually a good call, everything loaded and nobody was waiting for their netflix. This most recent router was a ""home system"". Not only does my dad insist in keeping the main tower and modem in the far corner of the house, but the range extender nodes are both too far and lose signal.

# Assholery:

Now, while I'm not a huge gamer, I do play ones that require a solid connection, such as fighting games, and I do stream on twitch as a hobby, and my only source of income until I find a position in my fields. If I had a dollar for every time this new router had decided to drop dead on me, I'd have enough to move out today. So, in an attempt to convince my parents to actually upgrade with the next router, I've begun pausing the wifi on them throughout the day.

3109,"AITA for writing a song dedicated a college coed who went missing in our town a few years ago? Using a Throwaway because contrary to some of the allegations that have been leveled against me I am not doing this for self promotion. I will also not name the girl because while it’s been very public I don’t want to bring attention to her family.

So several years ago a 20-year-old coed went missing in my hometown, well there have been several semi breaks in the case nothing has ever come of her disappearance. I always thought she was a beautiful young girl in the case deeply affected me because it was so close to home.

Maybe a year or so ago I was  up in the middle the night and sort of inspiration hit me and I wrote a song about the disappearance. I think it’s very good and very genuine and if nothing else it brings attention back to the case and it seems like it’s stalled out. I sent a copy of the song to her family and they basically responded with “we appreciate your effort’s but this is really not in line with our values but we appreciate you bringing attention to the case.” I figured that was fine enough and they’re the the family.

I took the song around to several radio stations and created a YouTube channel and really didn’t get any play out of it which is fine, if people don’t like it they don’t like it. 

Well for one reason or another my YouTube channel got a little bit a buzz recently and it’s been extremely negative and people are really making fun of me. In fact so much so that a lot of times I go out in town people will quote lyrics from the song to me and it basically makes fun of me. Well this buzz also got the attention of her family again and they sent an incredibly nasty email tell me telling me to drop it that they warned me once they werent appreciative of the song and if I kept it up, they are going to have to “take action.” I responded to the email and said I was sorry and I was just trying to bring attention to the case and this particular family member just replied with “you’re a fucking creep, let it go.”

I’ve deleted my YouTube channel since obviously my message wasn’t getting across, but I haven’t slept a wink since the exchange with her family member. I am wondering if I am the asshole for writing that song?","YTA. Family said they didn't like it and you still went on with it. Also it's creepy how you refer to this missing woman.

A month ago, I met up with him to do a final review before my exam. After our session, we started talking about our personal lives, like what we were doing in the summer. He said he will be doing a research job at the hospital which I will also be interning at. I thought it was such an awesome coincidence and said, “So, maybe we can hang out a bit during the summer then?” He replied, “Yeah, that’d be great.” So I felt very confident and said, “If you’re free tonight, maybe we can go for a drink or something?”

He then said, “I’m actually engaged.” There was an awkward silence. We said goodbye and left. Now it’s the summer, and I just started interning at the hospital. I saw him last Friday doing an orientation. I went over and said Hi to him, and he said hello back. We had a short conversation, and I asked him if he wanted to do lunch on Monday. He said he will “get back to me” by the weekend.

Well the weekend passed and he didn’t say anything. I figured his fiancee didnt let him attend. Kind of controlling but whatever. I saw him again this morning, and asked about lunch. He said he can’t make it because of a “prior commitment”. I laughed and joked, “Your fiancee doesnt have to know.” He did not find it funny. He then made an excuse to leave and was kind of rude about it.

One morning I'm sitting in class (about 8am) and my teacher is asking questions on something we know almost nothing about.  He hasn't taught us the subject before and is just now teaching it even though we graduate in a month and are supposed to be ""certified"". Nobody could answer his questions and he got mad and assigned a 5 page paper on the subject due Monday which we just started working on yesterday.

3114,"AITA for telling teenage boys that its okay to think periods are gross? Alright reddit, hear me out.

I'm a student studying computer science at a local university, and I help run a robotics club for young teens at a local rec center with two other college students. The club is very chill, and I feel as though I mentor as much as I teach. It usually runs pretty smoothly.

Here's where the problem starts. From what I understand, one girl, Faith (11), who is generally quiet and introverted, got her period during club time and quietly asked another student, Alicia (12), if she had any pads. Alicia, then yells to the crowd (about 20 students + 3 college kids), ""I need a pad, who has a pad!"" Alicia is very outgoing, and I'm pretty sure she was genuinely trying to be helpful. Ben (12) (Alicia’s good friend) quickly shouts back ""Ew, Alicia, that's so gross, now everyone knows you're on your period!"" Ben is also outgoing and clearly thinks this is a funny joke judging by the grin on his face. Now, these two joke around a lot, and I don't necessarily think this is a problematic joke between friends who are both comfortable with periods; However, someone in the room said ""yeah, that's kind of gross"" in a non-joking tone. Someone shot back ""No, that's dumb, they're not gross,"" and the whole room erupted into debate.

After about 30 seconds of this, I was able to yell to the crowd to quiet down, and I gathered them all in one section of the room to resolve this issue. This is what I said (not word for word, but pretty close);

""It's okay to think periods are gross, but in the same way that blowing your nose and pooping can be gross. They're all normal bodily functions. Yes, these things can be gross, so we have solutions to make sure we stay hygienic. When your nose is running, you use a tissue to clean it up, after pooping, you use toilet paper. When you're on your period, you use a pad or tampon or other product. It's the same thing. No one should be ashamed of having their period just like no one should be ashamed of having to blow their nose. It can be gross, but it's okay. The front desk has pads and tampons if you need them. Does that make sense?""

Everyone nodded and seemed to think that I gave an appropriate explanation. One boy even said that was a good way to think of it. Everyone went back to their respective corners of the room and I thought I did a good job of resolving the situation. However, my two teammates came up to me later and said that it wasn't really cool to tell pre-teen boys that periods can be gross. They thought I was setting these boys up to be sexist in the long run because they won't remember my reasoning, they'll just remember that I said periods were gross. I don't think that's true, but several of my friends agree with my teammates and think that I shouldn't have even said periods can be gross at all.

3119,"AITA for telling people they shouldn't have dogs in a mall food court? Around here, dogs are everywhere.  I generally like dogs, but I do know a number of people that are allergic to dogs, afraid of dogs, etc.  My feeling is that people taking dogs where they shouldn't are abusing the general non-confrontational behavior of people, staff, etc, while stepping on rules.  

I see a couple in line at a food court restaurant in the mall. It's something the size of a German Shepherd, and on a leash. I say to the guy holding the leash, ""Dogs aren't allowed in the food court.""

He looks at me and just nods. 

So I say, ""That is a dog. This is a food court. Your dog is in it.""

He just nods, smiles, gives a ""yep."". The woman he was with says to me, ""You need to step back.""

So, I leave. 

My issue -- the mall is apparently dog friendly. Indoor food establishments in California don't allow dogs, but there doesn't appear to be a sign. 

So, am I the asshole?


Edit:

So, good news!

Thanks to everyone saying I shouldn't try to enforce the law, and instead find someone in authority, I found out that I could get a reward of up to $100 for reporting just this one incident.  And if they find it's a common occurrence, I could end up with $5k!

If that happens, r/RandomActsOfPiizza will have a very good day.


Edit:

For the record, I did get a note back from the department of health:

""I am at the mall conducting inspections at least once a week and have noticed the same issue. The only dogs allowed in the food court and dining area/terrace are service animals. Per ADA service animal law, no identification or vest is required to indicate proof of a service animal. The only legal questions may be asked:

Is that dog a service animal?
If so, what services does the animal provide?
Emotional support is not considered an approved service for service animals. I have included some handouts on service animals. Unfortunately, when I ask the above questions, majority of the time the public states the dog is a service animal and gets very upset when I try to ask the second question. I simply provide the information to those I see with dogs and let them know only service animals are allowed and no pets. There are signs posted throughout the facility, however I have told mall management to provide bigger signs or have security monitor the food court more. Anytime I see an animal and it has been confirmed that the dog is not a service animal, I report it to mall management to have security handle the manner. If you would like to put in a formal complaint, I will be happy to take care of the complaint and sit down with mall management.

The walls between our rooms aren't well isolated so she claims she can hear every single word I say. She also says having PDD-NOS (a form of autism) on top of it makes it very hard for her to focus. I can't say much about the volume of my speech since I don't think it's loud, but she says it is. However, I'm willing to lower my voice when she's studying but that won't do. 

I agree that her education is more important than my entertainment, but I also think I can do things like this in my room in my free time. She refuses to get noise-cancelling headphones or earbuds (something that helps me preventing outside distractions with my ADD) and I don't have the impression she will change her mind anytime soon. What she does want is forbidding me to talk whenever she's studying every day. She does this in the middle of the day/evening which is also when I talk and she'll want me to be silent for four hours. 

I do have to mention that my calls are usually pretty lengthy. This is why it's inconvenient to interrupt a call only to continue it four hours later, or wait four hours with starting a call. Doing something else than talking in this time obviously is the best option and it's what she wants me to do, but this voicechatting is my only way of communication with my best friend.

3126,"WIBTA If I left a note for my neighbours with couples counseling resources and anger management info? My backyard faces a bunch of other backyards-One of my backyard ""neighbours"" have an extremely volatile relationship. Every other day all anyone hears is him SCREAMING at his girlfriend. Fuck this, fuck that, fuck you, etc. It can go on as late as 2am and start up as early as 5am. My bedroom happens to face the backyard so I often wake up to his aggressive screaming, and try to sleep through it. 

I suffer from PTSD due to past abuse, and his screaming (I cannot stress how loud it is) causes me severe stress and anxiety, especially waking up to it in the middle of the night. I am in therapy and using my coping skills to help me handle the emotions that come from being forced to hear it, but being woken up by screaming and swearing takes me back to an unsafe space in my mind right away before I am awake enough to realise what is happening.

I never hear her, only him, and a lot of his language is on par with that of an abuser - ""you're the reason I have to yell at you like this"" and ""if you hadn't burned dinner I wouldn't be so angry at you and have to scream"", basically blaming her for his inability to control himself. I have called the police once because he was practically breaking the patio door down to get in. The yelling somewhat died down for a week but picked up again over the last 2 weeks.

WIBTA if I left a note on their door saying ""We can all hear you and it is impeding on our sleep and general comfort of home. I have attached some resources that might help. Please either get the help you need, or kindly keep it down."" And attach some free counseling resources, and a list of free classes offered at a local community center, including couple’s communication, anger management, and relationship skill building.

I am really struggling with what to do - moving is not an option, I don't know either of them personally and don't want to provide domestic abuse information because that can be dangerous if he finds it first. I can't know for sure if physical abuse is taking place, but I do know that emotional abuse definitely is and know first hand how damaging it can be.

Someone suggested a note saying ""break up or shut up"" but when I was in her shoes, breaking up wasn't really up to me once he had worn down my self worth. I also don't see the benefit to shouting ""shut the fuck up"" out my window as some other people have.

I don't feel that calling the police will do much unless it is a physical safety issue like when he was breaking down the glass door and I'm worried if I do it too often, they will either tell me to stop or they will stop coming.

She's been hospitalised twice in 6 months, and 5 times this year. We've tried everything, from keeping the dogs as away from her with air purifiers to sectioning off areas of the house. Nothing has worked.

Allergy shots aren't an option for medical reasons. BM got the judge to agree that she can't live in a house with dogs, and it is abusive and harmful. It could literally kill her. We would legally be charged with her death if we keep the dogs and the worst happens.

My two dogs and my husband's dog are our babies. My husband is willing to re-home his dog, but I can't do it. They're 4 and 6 and won't be able to be adopted. They will be put down if I surrender them. I'm sobbing just thinking about it. We just had a baby, so me moving out with the dogs isn't really an option. 

We've had to settle on moving to every other weekend with my husband taking SD to a hotel for now. I feel horrible about this but I don't know what option we have. I can't risk my dogs' lives, and I can't risk my stepdaughter's life. BMs friends and family are gloating that they were right to tell BM that 50/50 was just a temporary inconvenience she'd have to deal with. DH is incredibly down about this and feels like he's abandoning SD. I'm trying to justify it by reminding myself that we live two hours away, so by the time SD was school age, someone would need primary custody anyway, but it's not helping.

Edit so that I'm not ""arguing in the comments"": 

We didn't know SD existed when we married, and paternity wasn't confirmed until she was a little over a year old. BM was basically a friend with benefits. I did not go into marriage knowing I had a stepchild or would be a stepparent.

She was hospitalised 5 times this year, which I'll admit was a lot. BUT, we didn't know exactly why. The first time, we just thought it was a bad attack. BM started screaming about the dogs, but the allergy wasn't fully confirmed, and I'm not going to immediately put down my pets on the word of a stranger who has every reason to lie. After visit 2, we confirmed the allergy, and we were making steps to reduce allergens AS RECOMMENDED. After visit 3, we doubled down and tried making the dogs outside dogs, but it didn't help and wasn't viable as they bark. After visit 4, the court summons happened. Visit 5 is very recent.","YTA. Very much so. Getting rid of a pet is hard - I won’t argue otherwise. That being said, this is a very easy decision. She’s been hospitalized multiple times. A fucking judge ruled you would be responsible for her death. You don’t care though; her life doesn’t mean much in comparison to the dogs. That much is clear. Not only that, but you’re forcing your S/O into a fucking hotel every other weekend (don’t even get me started on the financial aspect) and you’ve considered moving out before you’ve considered giving up the dogs, so I guess you don’t care about your relationship either. I feel sorry for your baby; god help them if you ever have to choose between them or the dogs.

Edit: didn’t know about the stepdaughter being hidden when this was first posted. That definitely makes this a far more sticky situation than it appeared at first. Undecided about whether or not the OP is actually the asshole.

Sunday we were reaching our final event and I looked on the preregistered attendees and noticed a regular, let's call him Matt(names changed). Matt is at our store at least twice a week, overwhelmingly kind, courteous and genuinely a great dude. Matt is in a wheelchair and has limited use of his hands but has a contraption you can place cards in that fan them out so he can see, he just needs someone to physically move them for him.

Matt arrives at the tournament and lets us know he brought along an aide to help him play and cleared it with his opponent for the first round, everything was perfect.

His aide unfortunately had a sudden emergency come up and had to leave leaving Matt without a person to help him play. He asked me if I was able to find someone to sub in for his partner. I voluenteered to help without a seconds thought. My coworkers were more than happy to let me play as his hands, so I went into the back and cleared it with a manager and he also said it was fine. Perfect, everybody wins. We play three rounds of the game, lose, but there's always next round. 

Between rounds the manager says he spoke to the higher up managers and said that if i were to keep helping Matt i had to clock out or else he would be disqualified from the tournament. No explanation given why me being paid for it wasn't okay but not being paid was. 

Now, Matt isn't competitive. But i didn't think it was right to DQ him over the fact the aide he brought had an emergency. I'm not a very confrontational person so I nodded, told my manager that i would clock out for final round. 

So, round three, i clock out, sit beside Matt and help him have the most fun games he had the entire event. Once his games are over i clock back in and go back to busy work. 

The more I sat with the idea the angrier i got though. I sat and thought about it and redrafted my resume and started handing it out to everywhere that would accept it. Once i am hired at a new workplace I am highly considering bringing this forth to the better business bureau or something similar. I'm still on the fence about telling Matt about the possibility of them trying to discriminate in the future (I am also worried about hurting his feelings so I probably won't) but it's his right to know.

But what irks me is that it’s like she regresses when she gets around her parents. I don’t know how to even articulate it. The lap thing though is the most obvious example. If I’m being frank, it weirds me out. I thought it was just me but one time at a birthday party for another family member, my own mom actually asked me about it. 

Basically my wife will sit on her dad’s lap and cuddle with him. Often put her arms around his neck and rest her head on his shoulder. I guess I just didn’t grow up in a house where people did that past like age 7, I don’t know. 

ALSO her dad still buys her presents that in my mind, are a bit much. For example, my mother-in-law told me that he’s planning to give my wife some kind of diamond pendant for Christmas. I guess it’s nice but also...why...

I spoke to my wife about the lap thing because I thought it was the most concrete things I could mention. But she got all defensive and irritated. By the end of the conversation she just goes “Fine! I won’t do it anymore!” 

I know she’s pissed at me now. But was I in the wrong? I mean is all this stuff normal and I’m just missing something? 

(Originally posted in the advice sub but someone pm’ed and said it might be appropriate here too). ","YTA. Just because you find it weird doesn’t mean it’s bad.

I distinctly remember him yelling at my brother for not doing the multiple different tasks assigned all at once. He still does this and it makes me very angry.

Today whilst in a Laboratory class we had small worm specimens (no nervous system, the length of a fingernail). We were told to carefully move the specimens to the middle of our dish and create a current with a pipette. I was doing this when I look over a couple of seats next to me to see two girls being very rough and disrespectful to the dish/specimen. I get up to see what they are doing (it's pretty common to just have a snoop at what everyone else is doing). They are a bit rude when I approached them, being quite cold. So I walk away back to my table as they continue to abuse the worm (I know they don't have a nervous system but they were being pretty disrespectful). So me being the loud mouth and stupid person that I am (also a bit angry from their cold reaction towards me) I called them ""retards who need to calm down and have more respect"" to my friends. Of course they heard me because I'm a loud mouth. I then see one of the girls look quite upset and they both kind of quiet down.

I know it was completely wrong to call them 'retards' because that is just not okay to use. But was I wrong in thinking that they were being disrespectful? I in no way thought they were harming the worm because these guys can be chopped up into 50 pieces and regenerate.

Jane-a girl i meet through my cousin at his high school, and my biggest crush yet.

Lois-Janes' BFF and a friend of Gary, met her while meeting Jane, we don't really like each other.

After having a crush on Jane for about a month Gary tells me that Jane is gay. Since i'm insecure and i thought i was going to get rejected anyway, i don't really care. However, since i like to get rejected to move on more easily, i decide to confess anyway. While Jane sounds very supportive in her response, and actively wants to be friends with me anyway (even tho i don't really want that, because i being friends with someone you like isn't very pleasant), she doesn't reject me, or even confirm her homosexuality. Another two weeks pass, and Lois texts me (which is weird, we only talk when Gary and Jane are around) and tells me i'm the only one out of the three (Gary Jane me) that can give her advice. She tells me she's been friends with benefits with Gary for about a month, but she likes him and wants something more. I engage Gary and ask him where is his asexuality exactly, to which he responds (paraphrasing) ""I've been sleeping with about 5 girls at the same time for a month now, ain't i awesome?"". Me, being a strong believer in monogamy, i ask what the fuck is wrong with him, and cut him off, coincidentally cutting of Jane and Lois as well. After two months (summer holidays) pass, i decide i shouldn't have cut Jane off, since i liked her, and she wanted to stay friends, so i text her, and we meet up a couple of times. Then the topic of summer comes around, and Jane tells me that: during summer she had a romance with Gary, and a pretty spicy one at that, but after the summer ended, he wouldn't even mention anything that happened. So then she and Lois got suspicious and it turns out Gary had been basically cheating on them with each other for the whole summer. When they confront him his response is ""i couldn't believe you were this easy to manipulate"". 

At this point, i realise that I've been (in a sense) betrayed, by the only two people who knew i liked Jane, and that the person closest to me, did it just because he felt like manipulating someone. I decide that even if i could i don't want to be in a relationship with Jane, and i definitely don't want to be her friend, so i cut her off once again.

Personally I don’t see the point in keeping it, I’d rather hold onto the memories of her and the ring would just be sitting in its box on my dresser for the rest of my life. 

I’m a broke university student so in my head it would make sense for me to sell the ring and use it for something that would mean a lot to me. I could use it to a) pay off my student debt b) go travelling or c) use it as saving for a downpayment for a future house. 

To me selling it and using it for that would have much more value and whichever I choose would allow me to remember my grandma how I would personally like to.

My dad told my extended family about me considering selling the ring and they all lost their shit. They genuinely seemed disgusted that I would even consider selling something so valuable to my grandma and grandad (both deceased) and they kept saying its not what she would have wanted me to do with it. Now I do agree that my grandma probably wouldn’t have wanted me to sell it as she was very materialistic and her jewellery meant a lot to her, but she left the ring to me and the ring has little meaning to me.

3186,"AITA for telling my wife she cannot get a tattoo? I’m 32 M and married to 26 F. We’ve been together 6 years. 

When we met, it was obvious we had some differences of opinion on certain things. My wife loves tattoos and piercings, I hate them with a passion. I have some very strong opinions on this stuff. She expressed an interest in getting her nose pierced but I managed to convince her it would look unprofessional (her career is very important to her).

She stopped mentioning tattoos / piercings for most of our relationship. Today, January 1st, we’re talking about resolutions. My wife said she wants to be a little more adventurous and get a tattoo.

Long story short I obviously hate the idea and made that known. Of course I can’t FORBID it, but she knows how I feel about it and that it would definitely affect my attraction to her. I just think they’re ugly, end of.

She’s upset because she says I’ve always known she likes this stuff and she’s held off this long because of me. I say this has come as a shock because I thought she gave up on the idea.

3187,"AITA for not giving my sister a +1 if she's my maid of honour? For two reasons really but my main reason is potentially AHolish. I've tried to compromise that he just comes to the reception but she's really upset that I didn't want him there at all.


1. I don't like her bf. I've had to pick her up crying at midnight because of him and when something like that happens she says he's abusive, and when they're happy again she says she was just exaggerating. Not just that though, I just don't like him, there's just something off about him and I really don't want him there at my relatively intimate ceremony. My partner and I are paying a lot of money per person for ceremony (with limited capacity) and wedding breakfast attendance, and it would mean someone we actually want there wouldn't make the list.


2. If she's my maid of honour she's supposed to be helping me, checking my hair is still in place and makeup isn't on my teeth, and would likely be running around sorting out last minute things to keep me less stressed on an already stressful day. So he'd just be there like a lemon on his Todd all morning. And if she has to babysit him as well she wouldn't be focussed on me like a maid of honour would be. I was so torn between my sister and best friend anyway and my best friend would most likely make up the slack but without the recognition which I think is unfair to her. My mum doesn't like the idea of me having a head bridesmaid and a maid of honour as well. So I've said if she really wants him there she can't be a bridesmaid let alone my maid of honour.


Am I being a bridezilla if I want my maid of honour/bridesmaids focussed on me for one day whilst we're doing wedding party things like photos and getting ready? 

We're sisters so we fight and make up but this has hurt her feelings. However, I don't feel like I should compromise much more and have to invite someone I don't like to my wedding. AITA?



Edit: we're operating generally on a kind of ""no ring no bring"" type situation. I didn't know that wedding party members were supposed to have plus ones - I think that might be an American thing?

Edit 2 for info: they've been official for 6 months.

Edit 3 verdict: turns out I'm an AH. I've discussed with my partner about giving wedding party +1s and we'd rather be AHs together about this. Funnily enough the reason most people think I'm an AH (the secondary reason) is the reason that my parents thought made the most sense, since they're of the mind I should just suck it up and invite people we don't like.","YTA. Your reasoning is super controlling. If it was strictly money concerns, I’d vote differently

Being a maid of honor is a privilege but it’s also a job of sorts. Acting like she owes you 100% of her attention to the point where she can’t bring her own partner is shitty.

3190,"AITA for paying my rent *too* early? I moved in to a new share house. It is a fairly casual arrangement with just a verbal agreement. I pay rent fortnightly, and I get paid forthrightly. I moved in just over a month ago, paying two weeks in advance.

It is a 6+ person household, and rent is a bank transfer to the one person on the lease. 

I got paid a few days after moving in, and I paid the next fortnight’s rent at that time. I included in the payment description the dates that this covered for (the following fortnight). 

A few days later, the person on the lease asked me if I was aware I paid rent “waaaaay in advance”, and mentioned they normally expect the payments to all come in the day before rent is due, so they can keep track of it easily. I responded that I prefer to keep my rent paid in advance, and that doing the transfer on payday helps me organise my money so I don’t overspend, or forget (both of which happen to me regularly - I am bad with money). 

They then mentioned that they were confused when it came in, and they don’t want to have to worry about keeping track of people’s payments if they all come in at different times. I responded semi sarcastically with “Well that sounds a lot like *your* problem.” (Semi sarcastically and as a bit of a joke, but the joke did not land.)

We haven’t discussed it since. When I got paid I was still stressing about it, so I decided to think it over. I ended up completely forgetting about it and had a massive panic yesterday that I missed rent, and I did the transfer then (it turned out I was still about 5 days early).

AITA if I continue to pay rent on my payday? If I continue this way I will never be more than one fortnight ahead at most. Please note I know my “joke” was a bit of a TA move, and I’m not asking about that.","YTA. They clearly ask you to do it X way, and if you go against their wishes because you're ""bad with money,"" that just means you're putting your own feelings ahead of theirs.

That being said, this arrangement is a legal disaster waiting to happen. What happens if they just take your money and tell you to get out?

I don't frequent many subs and I love /r/AITA and thought maybe I could get an opinion on whether I'm doing the right thing (NTA) or wrong thing (YTA). If the mods don't want it here, I understand if it's deleted. Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I'm 38M and I have two daughters, 10F and 8F. I'm not with the mother, but I have shared custody. Since we live so close, it's a matter of ""where do you want to spend the night"" to our girls because schools are equidistant between us, etc.

I think I'm going insane. For the last two weeks, I've noticed my state of mind has changed dramatically. I don't know what's wrong with me but I'm going to see a doctor soon.

What's wrong? It feels like my senses are warped, specifically my brain and thoughts. I lose track of time (long stretches of time at that), I'm having a very hard time seeing anything, sometimes I just see lights. It's like my brain has too much stimuli and it's overflowing or causes glitches in my senses. I'm doubting my sense of reality.

Here's two examples: the other day I went for a walk to the store to pick up a premade salad and some olives. I walked to the store, stood outside in the rain for allegedly 30 minutes before an employee asked if I was okay. I didn't know where I was, why I was there. But I did, I just couldn't connect the dots in my head. I knew the answers but my brain's voice made me think I was lying or remembering incorrect and instead I was just lost. I don't even remember how I got home.

Three nights ago I was driving and I got an overwhelming feeling of dread. Like death is a second away at any time. To an onlooker, it might have looked like I was drunk. I couldn't focus, there was just too much visual stimuli. I even swerved off the road to avoid what I thought was an oncoming car in the wrong lane yet it was just a stationary street lamp. What was a 20\~ minute drive felt like 20 seconds.

I gave a friend my car keys and vowed to not drive anymore. I even went to a police station and asked about that night if there were any accidents on the roads I took in case I hit someone and didn't realize it.

I'm thinking of surrendering my parental rights to my kids because I fear for their safety. I fear for my own safety. I don't want to see my kids anymore because of the state I'm in. I feel like I'm going to die at any moment, and even if it's an unreasonable thought, it's just how my brain is working right now. I barely have control anymore. I don't do drugs, I don't drink, I'm not stressed out with anything except this situation I find myself in.

Am I wrong in wanting to give up my kids? I don't know if I'll ever see them again. Their mother is a good person, and even if we don't see eye-to-eye on parenting, she's pure and I know she'd take care of our children in my absence: temporarily or permanently.

I am sorry for the long post.","This isn’t the right thread for this. I’d say go to an ER immediately.

3196,"WIBTA for not letting my roommate’s boyfriend sleep with her in the bunk above me? Context: I live in a suite of four people with a common room and two doubles with bunk beds. Sexy, I know. One of my suitemates has had an SO stay over (without having sex) in her bunk while her roommate (my other suitemate) slept in the same room. The latter had consented to this arrangement and there were no problems.

Previously, I had had someone stay over for a few days in the common room, and he would occasionally sleep in my bunk while I wasn’t there. All of my suitemates agreed to let him stay, and I had given them the option to say no when I asked if he could come over. I didn’t, however, ask my roommate if he could sleep in our room (but my bed). This is important.

All of this is to provide some context for the dynamics of our room. Now we get to the situation at hand: earlier tonight, my roommate asked if her boyfriend could stay the night in our room with her. She made it clear that nothing would happen while I was in the room, but to be honest, I’m not entirely comfortable with the idea of having this guy sleep above me. We don’t know each other very well.

3203,"AITA for asking for my money back? Hey,

So it was my birthday about a month ago and I decided to have a small gathering at a Korean BBQ restaurant. After compiling the list of people I wanted to invite, I told them that the price of the food would be $25 a person which everyone agreed to expect for one person. That one person, lets call her D, privately messaged me telling me she would reconsider coming since the price was so expensive and she was saving up money to go to school in France. I told her that's fine and decided to venmo her $10 to help her out to come as I was hoping for a full attendance. Let me preface this by stating that this friend and I haven't had the greatest of relationships as I was at the time dating her best friend which I caused some conflict.  Aside from that, she came asking me what gift I would want which I responded to with ""whatever you think is best""

So fast forward to the dinner, everyone showed up and is having a great time... Except for D who is complaining about the food and how you have to cook it yourself etc. Along with this, she didn't bring a gift and even though that does not matter as much to me, it still felt weird that I was helping pay for someones dinner even after the behavior they exhibited. So the next day I decide to text D politely asking for my money back as I just felt like it wasn't deserved after the behavior she had brought the night previous. To this I got a barrage of messages saying that I shouldn't ask for my money back as it is now hers and is rude for me to ask for it back as I already had sent her it.  I just told her to not spend it on drugs as that is a hobby of hers and at least to save the money for college.

So my quarrel with myself and others is that many have told me that I am TA for asking for my money back while others think that the behavior which she brought to the dinner was enough reason to ask her to send my money back.

EDIT: So I did mention how this person is saving for college but I will go more in depth about it. She has told me multiple times about how cheap her college is (800 USD a year) and honestly uses the ""broke"" statement as a way to hide the fact that she is ""good with her money"". Given her family's financial situation it is far from the truth to call herself broke as she constantly shows off her dads Audi on snapchat

3210,"AITA for logging into other student's portals and checking their grades/personal information? This happened in eighth grade and for a majority of my high school career.

&#x200B;

Up until the last few months of my senior year of high school, everyone in my school district had the same login info (by default) to view grades:

&#x200B;

Username: Student ID number

&#x200B;

Password: Birthdate

&#x200B;

Obtaining this information was not very difficult for me. Every student in the entire school district had a Google account - [studentID@districtname.org](mailto:studentID@districtname.org). If I went to the ""Google Contacts"" page while logged in to my school account, I could search someone up, and find their studentID within their email address.

&#x200B;

Finding their birthdate for the password was a bit more tricky. I'm an introvert and don't talk much, nor do I have much friends. So I couldn't just ask, ""Yo, when's your birthday?"" or they'd know something's up.

&#x200B;

Instead, I made an Instagram account under a fake identity, followed a bunch of people from my school, scrolled through their profile to find posts which they made during their birthday, and noted down their birthdate information.

&#x200B;

Then, I proceeded to login to see their grades and who their family members/doctors are + their contact information, etc.

&#x200B;

Some students had changed their password, but many still had their default password and this method worked. Keep in mind, I didn't see other student's grades and personal information to hurt them or use it against them, but rather to compare myself with them and feel better (or worse) about myself.

&#x200B;

I never changed their password or fiddled with their settings, or changed the courses they had signed up for. I just saw their grades (and their personal info if it was my first time accessing their portal) and then logged off. I really just wanted to see out of curiosity how other students in my school were doing academically, and in the case that we were in the same class, how our grades compared.

&#x200B;

Yes, I did feel pretty shitty sometimes because some people had a better grade than me in some classes, but that was to be expected.

&#x200B;

Once again, I had no means to mishandle or misuse what I got out of logging in to other student's portals. It was just done out of curiosity. None of the people whose accounts I logged into knew what I did. There is an IP log in the portal, but no one really reads that tbh.

3212,"AITA for telling the hosts of our D&D game that their baby is an issue? I've been a part if a grop of adults that get together to play DND every week for about 3 years now. We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.

A little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. 

Now to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.

I am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. 

After a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like ""so I can't play ever again."" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.

I would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. 


TLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?

Edit: I am not a part of the game night where the issue was brought up so I can't be sure exactly what was said. Also, I am female. I told her yesterday that I feel like shit about the situation because I loved having her join the game. The baby was putting more stress on everyone including the parents than it would have in an every day situation. My financial situation hasn't been the best in the past but I have a much better job now, I'm going to try to get the group to pay for a sitter because both parents deserve some time to relax. I always try to bring snacks to share as well, in the past ive just brought something like a bag of chips because again, my financial situation was not the best. 

I don't think that hosting elsewhere would be a good solution. That would still feel like we're kicking her out of the game deliberately which we are not trying to do. I realize now how it came across to bring up the issue especially because she just joined. 

To everyone calling me an asshole, don't worry, I 100% feel like one even as I wrote the original post. This is something that we will have to work to solve as a group, starting with a group apology and clarification. ","YTA if you expect to continue having game nights at their home.

3221,"AITA for being disappointed/pissed that my best friend started watching my favourite show with her boyfriend and not me? So I know this is incredibly childish but please bear with me. 

I've known my best friend for over five years now. I don't have many other friends so I rely on her a lot, but I try not to pressure her too much. She on the other side is very """"""popular"""""", has many other friends and goes out almost every week. 

She's been with her boyfriend for almost a year now and yeah I admit it, I'm a bit jealous. I mean, she kind of replaced me and does everything with him now, I'm basically just in second place. I've talked to her about this before but it it didn't lead anywhere so I just left it. I mean I can't force her to spend more time with me and less time with him. 

We still see each other about every 1-2 months and text almost every week. I'd like to spend more time with her again, but alas, she doesn't have the time. 

That's all the background info, now about the situation. 

I've been trying to get her to watch my favourite show for MONTHS. 
So when we saw each other last time I asked her if she started watching it yet. 

Her response was something like this: ""Oh yeah! I've started watching together with [boyfriend] and he loves it too! It's great!""

So that really hurt me for some reason. I didn't really respond to that and just switched the topic, so fyi, I didn't lash out on her or anything. 

I'm just really not sure if I'm justified about my feelings. The logical part of me knows of course that she's an adult and can do whatever she wants, I don't own this show, etc, but I'm still kind of disappointed. 

I was hoping we'd watch some episodes together or at least she'd watch it alone. It feels like she took another thing from us as best friends and gave it to her boyfriend. This could have been an ""Us"" thing. 

Now the feelings have been festering as a mixture of hurt, guilt, dissappointment, and shame and I think I need some input.

3225,"AITA for convincing the captain of my debate team to deliberately stress out someone as a test? Seeing a lot of debate related posts on here recently, thought I'd add my own to the pile. This happened last year, and while some people consider me the asshole in this situation, I disagree. 

So last year I was a junior, and I moved schools. I've always been big on debate, and my goal was always to become president of a team. This of course is much harder to do when junior year you have to move halfway across the country. I joined the team at my new school, but ofc nobody knew me, so they were far less likely to vote for me. 

There was one kid, Sam, who was projected to be president- the way I saw it, he wasn't great at debate and most likely the greatest at leadership either, just popular. I knew I couldn't really waltz in junior year and match the relationships he had been cultivating for a while. So I figured, the best way to win would be to show that he would be a terrible leader. To do this, I convinced the president at the time to test his leadership abilities by allowing him to essentially 'be President' for two weeks. And if it got out of hand, she could step in. She agreed, and as I predicted, he collapsed under the pressure: being president of the team meant loads of paperwork, constantly dealing with issues, mediating drama, etc, and he failed so bad the president had to step in half way through.

Nobody was willing to vote for him anymore, so I managed to win. He thought I was an asshole for putting him under that position. I disagree: he wanted to be president, and as president he would face the same pressure on a daily basis. I was simply seeing if he was up to the test. I did it with selfish intent, but at the end of the day, I proved that he would be a shitty leader and I would be better.

Given this I’m one of the members with the most authority when it comes to making decisions. So a few months back I brought into discussion the possibility of making the auditions much more stricter, also suggested the idea that then older members would mentor the new members. They agreed

Now here’s the issue we had our last cycle of auditions and a team member brought a person she handpicked lets call him A. Now this is the part were I might be the asshole but from the moment I enter the room I’m judging the new students, from how they greeted me, how they were dressed, how they approached others and how they reacted to others approached. Why? Well because in these types of debates the person with the most facts don’t always win, we need people who are charismatic, appealing, to a certain degree attractive, who have a good voice and are able to catch the public’s attention. 

So as I approached A to give him a cordial handshake he couldn’t even look at me straight in the eye and didn’t have a firm grip either needless to say he was rather shy and quiet. after the formalities and introductions the auditions started A didn’t have proper posture, had a monotone voice and frankly his speech was a bore even with good evidence his speech didn’t have any emotion or passion it felt as if he was forced to give said presentation.

After this we sent him away and started to discuss  about A to which I immediately said no and that’s when arguing ensued, I’ll try to keep it short but most were shocked at my judgement and told me he made a good speech when it came to content and that his flaws as to presentation can be worked on and I just said that he had too many flaws not just presenting but also he just didn’t seem a good fit for our team as we’re very loud and social then they told me that we can get him out of his shell and I simply said that it wasn’t our job to which I received even more backlash, so I then asked “well if you all want him so much who’s willing to take him in and mentor him?” And that’s when no one raised a hand (not even the person who brought him in) except one girl we’ll call her B. B said that she was willing to take him in and train him but then I said that she couldn’t because first I brought B in the team meaning I’m her mentor and she was new to the team and I told her that I appreciated her initiative but that she was in training herself and couldn’t take anyone at the moment, needless to say she was furious at me.

I’m printing something for a project for my final and it’s 2 parts. The first part finished earlier that day and the second part is a 26 hour print. It had been printing for 8 hours by the time everyone was over. 

We are all standing around talking and she gets near the printer walking backwards. She’s been over numerous times and while the printer isn’t loud, it’s not exactly fucking quiet.

I was gonna say something but I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt that she knew it was behind her.

Then she stepped on it. Now it’s not in an enclosure but it was printing on the front of the bed so she didn’t damage anything that I know of.

She apologized and I said it was cool. I checked the print and it was a little wonky, but figured it could have been like that. 30 minutes later they leave to run to the store, and I check the print better. It caused a significant shift in the layers, so the print is ruined. 

She wasn’t there anymore but I was complaining about how that was 8 hours and material wasted. I was upset, and I feel that’s a normal reaction to this. My roommate started telling me to chill out, which made me even more frustrated. He took the part of the counter and threw it away.

I grabbed it out of the trash can and started seeing if maybe I could still use it somehow. I decided to Atleast see how my diaroma will look with all the parts, so I start cleaning the supports off the failure.

A few weeks after moving in, everything was going great. We decided to go out with some mutual friends. When we were walking, he was running around like crazy, so I jokingly said ""down dog!""

I also know other women within my outer friend circle he had slept with, and mutual friends have told me he has women he sees frequently in destinations he visits for work. This didn't bother me as I had recently got out of a long relationship that was sexually unfulfilling, so I wasn't looking for anything serious - I just wanted to have fun, and we always used protection.    

&#x200B;

After that week together, we texted non stop for about a month, then I slowly stopped hearing from him. He let me know a couple months later that he was in town, and we hooked up a couple times. Over the next year he would come by every few months and we'd have a lovely time. My best friend is aware of all this and there isn't any ill will between us. We go to shows, take trips together, and we are each other's confidantes. I know that my friend and and my FWB follow each other on social media, but they don't really have contact.   

&#x200B;

So the current situation: He and I have been texting regularly over the past two months; at least 3-4 times a week. A few days ago he told me he was going to be in town this week, and we've both expressed how much we are looking forward to seeing each other. Except today, he DM'ed my friend sort of suggestively in response to her Instagram story, trying to initiate conversation. She told me right away, and she made brief small talk with him to see if he would try anything, but she eventually just stopped responding. Am I the asshole for being super pissed and wanting to blow him off this week? I don't expect a lot from him, but I feel disrespected.

3244,"AITA for telling my girlfriend she needs to wear matching clothes? My girlfriend [22F] of 4.5 years has always had an out there sense of style. I [23F] tend to dress (as she puts it) like a mom. An ongoing fight in our relationship has always been whether or not it is ridiculous for me to ask her to match and look presentable when we go out together. It doesnt matter if we're just going to the grocery store or if we're going on a nice date. She needs to match. 

Recently she has accused me of ""putting a bushel over her flame"" by imposing this standard on her. Her mental health has been declining, and she. claims that losing her sense of style is part of her struggle with self identity. I've been very supportive of her trying to find a sense of style that she loves, but she also doesn't really want to develop a style - she just wants to ""be able to wear funky colors together and mix stripes and polka dots"". I don't think either of those things are ridiculous, but I think wearing lime green, purple, and teal all together is.

AITA for wanting my girlfriend to wear clothes that match when we go out together?

There were groups and groups of students all wearing a specific t-shirt of various colors with most of them having stuff written on them with a sharpie. While I was waiting in-line I noticed that there was a girl who, in my opinion, had a pretty funny phrase written on the back right shoulder of her shirt.

3250,"AITA for leaving my gf alone in my apartment while I had a drink or two with friends? &#x200B;

A little background info, I am 37f and she is 27 and due to work obligations we basically see each other once a week, either she comes over to my apartment and stays for 2-3 days or I do. During this particular week she was over at my place and we had an awesome time together the first dau. The next day I was supposed to be at work from 9am to 4pm and I left her alone in my apartment while I tended to work. During my shift I learned that I had to stay until 4:30 because my shift change was running late and I told her that I was coming home asap and she said it was okay and that she didn't mind hanging alone for a little while.

&#x200B;

So fast forward two hours later I completely lost track of time, didn't text her or call her that i was gonna be late and even though my shift ended at 4:30 i went to have a drink or two with friends. She wrote me a message at 6pm asking me what's the hold up and I told her i am having drink with friends, she didn't reply. When I arrived home at around 7:30pm she wasn't there yet I felt like a terrible piece of shit when I peeked into the kitchen and saw that she'd made my favorite dish and plus went out of her way to get my favorite wine.

&#x200B;

She came back at round 10:30, still pretty mad and I asked her where she was she said she was out with a friend. Then she confronted me by saying that she understands if my friends or colleagues dropped by at my workplace and it was fine and that she wouldn't have been upset if I texted her and told her that I was running late, she wouldn't have minded even if i arrived home at 00:00 and that all she needed was the info so she wouldn't wait around like an idiot alone. I could see she was upset and if she did the same thing I would have been way more upset than she was at the moment and yet I made the situation worse. All I said to her was ""this is who I am, deal with it"", she then proceeded to pack up all her stuff, threw the dinner in the garbage and left. I begged her to stay but she didn't.

&#x200B;

For reference, my sister went to art school back in our home state. The rest of our family moved to another state when she was a sophomore, but she was already living in dorms and stayed to finish school.  She's always been on the shittier side when it comes to mental health, ie eating disorders, depression, stuff like that,  but AFAIK she's been taking medication for it. She graduated in May (with no job offers, of course) and moved back in with us. She got a retail job nearby and keeps trying to work on stuff for her portfolio, but lately she's been ""to depressed to feel inspired"" and just keeps giving up after a few hours of drawing.

I am allergic to lying so I fessed up, had to rehome my precious froggy friends, and got a warning on my record.

After lunch a few people had to go for various reasons, one of them let's call him John had to go to have lunch with his sister.

I really badly wanted ice cream but 7 months pregnant + torrential rain + not being able to drive meant that I couldn't really justify leaving the house just for ice cream. I resigned myself to not having ice cream until my girlfriend got home from work, which wouldn't be for about 5 hours, and then I remembered that several pizza chains have Ben and Jerry's.

Went with Dominos because they had phish food. Got that, fudge brownie, and cookie dough. Came to £17.97 with free delivery. I didn't have change and needed a couple quid for the bus tomorrow, and I had a £20 note, so I opted to pay cash.

About 15 minutes go by (I live about a 10 minute drive from the store so assuming this was pretty immediate), guy arrives, I take the ice cream off him, hand him the £20 and thank him. He pockets the £20. He turns to leave. I figure he forgot so I say ""um... change please?"" He turns back, apologises, reaches into his change pocket and counts out my £2.03. He leaves. After I shut the door I have an ""ohhhhh"" moment when I realise that he probably thought the change was a tip.

Girlfriend came home hours later and asked me where I got the ice cream, I told her, plus the thing where he paused. She laughed and said ""oh my god we're never ordering from Dominos again!

I know the basics of asexuality (people who aren't sexually attracted to anyone), but I don't know a lot more about that.

I moved in with my sibling, with the agreement of paying half our shares for bills. But once my SO arrived this started souring. Financially it hasn't been stable before my SO arrived, my sibling and I worked at temporary work agencies until they found a well paying government job, while I still worked jobs at minimum wage. That being so, it's mainly been a 60% to 40% load on us. I being the latter. However I now have a job that will put my sibling and I equal in pay. All boiling down to that I don't want my SO getting a job for two reasons. They're applying for disability which has been in progress for months, with appointments missed because of their disorder and lack of transportation. (We lived separately at the time and my SO didn't have a phone.) Working while applying will get them disqualified for disability. And the other being that I'm willing to put in more money to cover my SO part of the rent. It's very difficult for my SO to do things without support, which I am more than happy to do.

3271,"AITA for thinking my roommate is faking/milking his injury? So 5 years ago my roommate got hit by a snow plow and tore his labrum in his shoulder. He just had surgery on it this past September, and has been doing PT. 

I'm glad he's on the right path to recovery after so many runarounds with different doctors, but he still isnt doing chores claiming it hurts his shoulder, ie doing the dishes or using a vacuum. 

It's been almost 3 months, i feel like the muscle itself should be fully healed and PT should have him strong enough to pick up some dirty dishes...

AITA?

EDIT: He told me he's worked up to lifting 40lb dumbbells in PT","YTA.

A serious muscle injury will take a lot longer to heal than a broken bone. The muscle cannot be immobilised for a length of time like a bone can. 

Doing a simple chore like washing some dishes can very easily aggravate the injury, and cause the muscle to swell, resulting in pain. 

I have a muscle injury - my lower back on the left side. It’s been two and a half years and I’m only about half way through a recovery. 

Your roommates injury will heal, but it will likely take a lot longer than three months. I’d expect a full recovery in around 12 months. 

If he’s able to do a chore with one hand, then he can do that. He can put clothes into the washing machine and turn it on. He can take the clothes out and put them in the dryer.
He can scrub the toilet bowl with one arm, and he can put away dishes with one arm. 

But don’t push him to do chores that in all likelihood will just aggravate his injury and cause him pain.

Edit: According to what I’ve read, it will take up to six weeks for the labrum to reattach itself to the bone, and another six weeks to strengthen. After that, you have to be very careful not to stress the injury - being so recently healed means there’s a higher risk of reinjury.",1,YTA,1.0,0.0,1

It was a purely business transaction. He agreed originally under no circumstances he'll let the second payment slide.

He ended up falling for her after they went on a trip to Vietnam for their fake honey moon and they both agreed to cancel the second payment.

3283,"AITA for telling mum SIL was pregnant? My (f28) SO (m33)and I have been together for ten years. A few years ago his dad was involved in a very serious car crash, for which he was at fault, and several people in the other vehicle died. 

The case took a really long time to go to court, and by the time it did, we had moved abroad, meaning we weren’t around for the trial. My SO’s brother and sister went to court with their dad every day, and my SO always felt terrible for not being there. It looked quite likely that he would serve jail-time, but in the end he received a suspended sentence.

At some point during the trial, my SO’s sister (Amy) texted to tell him he was ‘going to be an uncle again’ but it was early days so they were only telling close friends and family. 

Later that week, I skyped my mum and she asked how the trial was going. I said SO felt bad for not being there, and even worse now because Amy is pregnant and doing a 300 mile round trip every day to be there for their dad. 

A few days later, my SO woke up to a text from Amy saying that what I had done was really out of order and now some woman she barely knows, knows she is pregnant. I honestly had no idea how she could have found out my mum knew, as they live in different towns, don’t know any of the same people, my mum doesn’t have facebook etc. I am also being 100% truthful when I say I did not think my mum knowing would be a problem.

Anyway, it turned out my mum had gone out and bought little outfits for Amy’s other child and my SO’s brother’s kids and sent them to his parents along with a letter saying (amongst other things) that she was thinking of them in this difficult time and at least Amy’s pregnancy was some good news for them. Now I think I probably am the asshole here, but I cannot get past the fact that nobody said thank you to my mother. She is very reclusive and embarrassed by her lack of education, so I know she must have written dozens of drafts and agonised over the letter. She was heartbroken because she had tried to do a kind thing and felt like she had upset everyone. I am still filled with rage thinking about how sad she was. 

Further info: Amy and her mum are not close, while I am very close to my mum and tell her everything, so Amy might not appreciate the fact that me telling her felt very natural to me.

This happened about three years ago, and I still have a very distant relationship with Amy and we have never talked about it. The reason I am asking now is because since then a lot of my close friends have become pregnant and been very clear about telling nobody before twelve weeks, and I am now realising I was very blase and cavalier about this.

&#x200B;

So where I'm from, striking is pretty common. A few months ago, I (16M) took a job in a mechanic's garage. The main reason is that in my free time I enjoy investing in stocks. However, my parents lost a lot of money in the stock market, so they won't give me any money for it, leaving me to get a job. I've been doing a pretty good job of it and got along with a lot of other people who work there, who are a mix of teens, university-aged, and a few adults. I've been looking to get promoted to a more advisory role, since I'd get a pay raise. 

&#x200B;

Talking to other people who work there, I've discovered that one particular coworker, let's call him Henry, had the idea for us to strike. See, a lot of people are frustrated with the  conditions- we were being paid very low for the amount of hours worked. I agreed with this assessment, but at the same time believe a strike would be stupid and pointless and would just result in everyone getting fired. See, firing employees for unionizing is technically illegal, but officials are corrupt, incompetent, or both. So I voiced my opinion that if we were to strike, we'd just get fired. But everyone just told me to shut up and stop being a pessimist. So I pretended to be convinced while I tried to figure out what to do.

&#x200B;

I decided, I tried to convince these people they were being idiots but they didn't listen, so I might as well do what's best for me. I figured if I gave my boss the info beforehand, that may win me some favor with him. Maybe not, because he is the type of guy to make you work overtime without paying you. Or I could just stay out of it altogether. All I know is that I don't want to strike, since I'm pretty sure i'll get fired.",YTA if you are selling this info for climbing up in your Career.

I'm getting a lot of flack from my wife for being visibly upset at this woman and I am currently in a state of being where I just don't want to be around her right now. 

This woman had a rebound relationship and got pregnant. She told my wife that she preferred to go condomless and, wouldn't you know it, when she missed her period, she insisted there was NO WAY she could be pregnant. 

My wife and I had a feeling after her third missed week that she was pregnant. At work, she asked her, 

""If you *are* pregnant, are you thinking of getting an abortion?""

The friend responded, ""ABSOLUTELY NOT. I would literally NEVER do that. If *anything*, adoption.""

Relieved, we offered to take her child. We realized that it was financially difficult for her so we even offered to help her out money-wise as well as emotional and familial support before and after the baby was born. I'll let it be known that she actually made us believe that if she *were* pregnant, we'd adopt it. This got me emotionally attached to the idea because she said that, at the very bottom line, she'd never ever even think about abortion.

It got brought up weekly for about a month (they're really close, this wasn't intruding- just causal conversation) until she went silent. We didn't hear from her for about 10 days. She sends my wife a text and says she got an abortion.

While I understand her fear (and realistically I *don't* fully understand since I'm a guy), I feel like I got bait-and-switched with a potential child of mine. I know it wasn't mine, but the reason I'm so upset is because she actually had us believing that this child could have been a part of our lives. This goes beyond an abortion debate. It got real and emotional investment happened. 

I have a hard time seeing her, so when she comes over, my wife intentionally keeps distance by hanging out with her on the porch while I go work or hangout in the basement. I understand she's probably hurt to, but I feel hurt to, and I just need time to get to a place where I can be civil and polite, because right now, in my heart, I'm not.

**EDIT:**

I think people are misreading, or maybe I wrote it poorly. Here was our outlook.

a. If she wants to keep the pregnancy, we will be there for emotional support and, since she's single and not really established, financial support. We would first to just be helpers, not trying to steal anyone's baby here. 

b. If she didn't want to keep the baby because of financial stress and emotional toll, we would gladly give it a home.

Since she was clearly against abortion, we thought those were the two best options to keep the baby in a stable environment.

I understand you got your hopes up and allowed yourself to be emotionally invested, but ultimately she’s not your incubator. Adoption is a great theoretical concept but pregnancy involves a hell of a lot of physical, emotional, mental and emotional turmoil. It’s not simply a case of popping the baby out, giving it to you, and going on her merry way. If she couldn’t do that she’s not wrong to abort.

You didn’t even know for sure at the time that she was pregnant. You allowed yourself to become emotionally invested yourself way too quickly, way too early, on a possibility (at the time). That part is on you.

Changing my vote. The more I think about it, the more unreasonable I think you are. The woman was vulnerable and at the time didn’t even know she was pregnant. What she needed was space to get her head round the reality of the situation and make choices for herself accordingly. She didn’t need you or your wife jumping in.",1,YTA,0.0,0.0,0

I don't have secrets to hide (I've never cheated or anything like that), but like everyone, I have private thoughts, whether they're serious or just kind of loopy thoughts that I feel like writing down and exploring for whatever reason.

I don't have special rules in our relationship or attempt to restrict her or hide myself otherwise. I just have this one thing which I think is very reasonable, which is *allow me to keep my journals private*. I had told her that if she decided to read them it would feel to me like a betrayal on par with cheating or worse.

I keep hand-written journals (as opposed to on PC) because the handwriting is part of the experience that makes journaling so therapeutic and helpful to me. I keep my current one in my nightstand and old ones in the closet. I noticed that they had been moved.  She said she moved them to get something, and I asked her if she read them and she admitted she did.

3303,"AITA for not wanting to go to a rave? Sorry for shitty formatting, I’m on mobile

I told my SO for weeks that I did not want to go to a specific rave. I’d been to one previously, but didn’t really feel interested in going to another. It felt like a waste of money for something I don’t enjoy in the slightest. She pretty much just brushed it off when I told her I didn’t want to go by telling me that I’d have fun and that I’d enjoyed the first one, which I disagree with. I felt like she really wasn’t listening to me every time it came up. Eventually, she decided she wanted to go to the rave for her birthday, and because of this I agreed. The closer it gets, the more I don’t really want to go and the more frustrated I get about the cost and the fact that I’m being dragged into it, despite weeks of saying I didn’t want to do it. It’s been causing some friction because I feel like she used her birthday as an excuse to drag me into something I didn’t want to do. 

Edit: I don’t think she intentionally used her birthday to get what she wanted. I just think it was the only thing she asked that worked. I also think when she was asking, she was legitimately convinced I’d have fun, but she was only convinced this because she wasn’t really listening to me when I was telling her I wouldn’t.

Here's as much information as possible:

* My fiance works from home.

* We've been together about 4 years. I am 33, she is 27.

* To be hones,t we are both 5-6 /10 on attractiveness scale, but like each other a lot.

* Sex life is okay, not as much as I'd like, but wife has legit health issues so it's fine.

* She has always enjoyed a lot of male friends.

* All indications tell me that she is very faithful to me romance-wise.

* However, there is a guy who I personally find annoying, boring and mildly creepy that she will chat by phone with for hours on end.

* She also often has lunch with the guy while I'm at work because he's usually unemployed.

* Sometimes when I come home from work I'll see that she has already invited the guy over and is chatting with him, gossiping. This makes me feel annoyed for some reason.

* She is an ""influencer"" and will very rarely or occasionally go out to do the ""influence event"" (usually a restaurant dinner) with the guy when I am not avialable (she always prefers to do it with me).

3309,"AITA for being frustrated with my friend for checking his ass out at the gym? It happened this morning and I'm pretty much over it now, but I came to Reddit in hopes of getting a 3rd party's perspective on our little episode.

&#x200B;

I was heading to the gym at our nearby rec center, but I figured I'd invite my friend to go with me so we could train together. For context, we're both recruits in the USMC, so the purpose of training was to prepare for being shipped out.

&#x200B;

He accepted, but chose to wear his new Spiderman full body suit to go to the gym. I reluctantly trusted that he'd be able to hold his own in an intense workout with the suit on, so I didn't make it an issue. (Not to mention he put it on moments before our uber came).

&#x200B;

Fast forward to our sets in front of the dumb bell racks, I'm sporting my recruit shirt, and so is he, but he had his Spiderman suit on from only the waist down instead of literally anything else. I was mid rep when I peered over to him, only to see him stray from his set and quickly check his ass out in the bottom half of his costume.

&#x200B;

I called him out for it because as his workout partner, it embarrassed me that he wasn't taking it seriously because he was distracted by his costume and that he proudly wore our Marine gear while doing so.

&#x200B;

He replied, ""Me checking out my ass in the mirror is no different than you looking at your arms in there."" and he proceeded to tell me I was being irrational for addressing his actions up to that point as a problem.

&#x200B;

I told him that it wasn't the same because I was actually exercising the muscle group I was looking at and it was to check my form, but he made me out to be the bad guy for judging his decision to look at his butt in his Spiderman suit he wore to the gym.

&#x200B;

Overall it wasn't a big deal, but it bothered me having an unproductive session because my friend was more focused on his get-up than he was our training. This was reflected in the portion of our workout we needed to be each other's spotters and he slacked off and played with his suit during my set and put in little effort for his, but insisted I spot him regardless.  He basically dicked around with his costume the whole time and the insignificant moment when he checked out his ass in the suit was when I chose to address it. We couldn't see eye to eye on the matter, which leads me to my question:

3310,"AITA for telling my GF she should start losing weight? So I (26m) have been together with my GF (26f) for 6 years now but we do not live together due to some difficulties in life. Tough we see us every weekend and it is usually me staying at her place.

Now the thing is that I have to use earplugs in order to sleep because... well she is snoring quite loud and heavily. I usually wake up 1-2 times per night and tell her to stop but I really can't sleep that well with her next to me and I don't really feel well rested in the morning. It was not an issue until now but I started to think that wearing earplugs all night can hurt my ears and it is definitely not something I want to use my whole life honestly.

So I tried to discuss the options.
The cause of snoring can be several reasons, sleep apnea (?) and all those things. But I also came up with with a more sensitive topic... her weight as the cause. I have to say she is quite obese these days. I think she even started to gain weight since the beginning of our relationship. She used to drop weight some time ago but stopped eventually. 

So I suggested to her that the problem might be related to her weight and that she should lose some.
She almost instantly started to cry. I did not blame her just telling her that weight can also be a factor. I did not touch this topic anymore. As I mentioned she started to lose some weight and with our limited time on weekends I tried to walk the dog with her more often so she stays motivated a bit longer but no success. She stopped after a while and I am afraid to start the topic again.

So this was about 1 year ago and I just can't stand her snoring anymore. Even with earplugs I wake up regularly and I don't feel really well when I wake up. To be honest it is quite hard to imagine to move in together because how would I be able to hear my alarm clock going off?

Am I the asshole for telling my GF she should lose weight and asking myself if it is possible for me to move in with her?

His has been open and successful for a couple of years, and I only opened mine a few months ago but am having some good success as well. I have recently been looking into bringing more waitstaff on and have been actively scouting competitors to poach from. I'm gonna say this outright, I don't think this is an asshole move, it's a legitimate business tactic and I don't feel any guilt. However, about a month ago I was eating at my brother's restaurant and was incredibly impressed by one of his employees, she was insanely good at her job and I decided to do my usual routine of offering her a pay increase if she wanted to work for me. Thankfully, she rang me the next day and we negotiated a good deal, including that she give a months notice to my brother. I wanted to make sure he had more than enough time to find someone else to replace and get trained up, and an entire month is ample for that. 2 weeks after she let him know she was leaving, he essentially told her she wasn't needed anymore and so she started working for me. This was great for a couple of weeks, all my customers like her and she works great with the other employees. A couple of days ago however, my brother came in and saw her working for me.

3317,"WIBTA for wanting to cut my siblings out of my life for not attending my wedding In 2015, I went through a pretty rough patch in my life. I was depressed and shut out all of my friends, family (2 parents + 7 siblings), and even my wife, Sarah. This period can be summed up with me breaking up with Sarah, lying to my family that we didn't get back together, and them finding out that we did get back together. I made a huge mistake and I apologized.

Now to the meat of the story. My family are not big fans of Sarah.* Yet, Sarah and I love each other very much, but we lived on different continents. Constrained by a work permit that fell through and an expiring visa, we got eloped and applied for her green card. This was decided and done within a week in January 2018. Afterwards, we told my parents and then told my siblings.

We also told them that we wanted to do a ceremony and reception in her European hometown in mid-August 2018. As a student, this was the best time. After hearing this, they were offended that I didn't include them in deciding a wedding date and location. I apologized that this was how it had to be.

In June 2018, we made the decision of cancelling and postponing the wedding due to issues with her green card. She ended up not getting it until October. I told my family that we would reschedule for the following summer in 2019 - around the 4th of July since this is when most of my family and friends would be off work.

After hand delivering the new wedding invites, emailing them wedding details, and calling them 1 month after the RSVP deadline, I found out that many of them weren't going. Some were angry that I was asking them if they were going to MY wedding. Some of them were upset/annoyed that I asked them why when they gave me their excuse. 

Anyways, here are a few excuses:

* Wedding was cancelled last year so not sure about this year - no one was attending the original one. If they weren’t sure, why can’t they ask?
* Too expensive - my family isn't rich but if they can afford a family of 3 - 5 to go to Asia and/or to vacation elsewhere for 2 - 3 weeks, I think they can afford one ticket to go to the wedding. I even offered to pay for their plane ticket.*
* No time - along the same lines, if they can go 2 weeks somewhere, shouldn't they have a few days to go to the wedding? In addition, the reason why everyone was going to Asia was to visit grandparents. This was triggered by the passing of my maternal grandma last year. My grandma was sick for the previous two years; why didn't they go then?
* No time to plan - in total, people knew about the wedding for over 1.5 years
* We don't feel comfortable staying there
* I wasn't sincere about my apologies
* It was inconvenient
* I deserved the family not going because of my past actions

Regardless, I'm extremely happy that my parents, 2 out of my 7 siblings, and 11 friends were at the wedding. However, I don't think what happened in the past warrants my 4 other siblings (1 had a legitimate reason) to skip their brother's wedding. They chose to not go to the most important day of my life. That hurts me the most. And for that, I want to cut them off.

3321,"WIBTA for continuing to sleep with someone I know wants more? I'll keep it short. Back in April, I hooked up with someone from my college after a party. That developed into an ""FWB"" thing. I put FWB in quotes because we aren't friends, we barely know each other, and it was strictly sex. Well early in May they decided out of the fucking blue that they wanted something more serious, and to their credit, they just came straight out with it.

I politely declined, because I'm just not interested in them that way. I have never suggested anything to the contrary. I told them (this is word for word) that I was only interested in sex, and that I would NEVER want anything more, and if that wasn't ok with them then it wouldn't bother me to stop sleeping together. They said they could ""handle it"" and that they didn't want to mess up what we already had.

We kept sleeping together. I felt like everything was fine because I had made my position clear and they had accepted it. By the end of the month (we were still hooking up) their friends were shooting me dirty looks. One of them texted me and said I was an asshole for ""leading \[their name\] on.""

I'm not leading anyone on. The way I see it, if my hookup has a problem with the situation it's their responsibility to do what's right for them. I enjoy the sex, and I don't think it's my responsibility to protect them from themselves. Apparently, their friends disagree.

TBH I was surprised I was assigned because my colleague Joe did the research for pitching the client. Usually if you did the research you will be the one on the team.

I think I was assigned out of luck. VP did not know Joe did the research. Joe did the research for the GM, not the VP. VP had the decision power. I bumped into VP in the office the day he was deciding who to work on it. No big differences between Joe and I.

3329,"AITA : staying in the right lane when there were signs telling traffic to go to the left lane. This might be fun.  I kind of already know what to expect from y'all.

Here goes.

Driving home from work every day involved a stretch of highway about 12 miles long.  Went from the edge of the city to a bridge.  There are 3 exits along this stretch.

When this highway gets backed up all the alternative routes get backed up as well.  I have been driving this route for enough years to know that going an alternative way when the road backs up is pointless.

One day as I approached this stretch I saw some new signs warning of upcoming road construction and to get in the left lane.  Myself, as well as all the traffic immediatly and ditifully does so.

Traffic immeidatly grinds to a halt.  Stop and go traffic until the contstruction.

As I progress through this 2 things start to stress me.  The first, the road construction is NOWHERE.  We hit the first exit - no construction.  2nd exit - no construction.  3rd exit - no construction.  Just before the bridge - construction.  That godamned sign should have been put up just beore the 3rd exit, all of us had sat in stop and go traffic - for 12 miles - needlessly.

The 2nd thing I noticed is that there was NO ONE AT ALL in the right lane AND there was NO REASON AT ALL for no one in that lane.  No cones to stop people. No barrells  No construction.  Nothing.  Just a sign every couple of miles telling people to get the fuck over - and absolute emptiness.  Took me well over an hour to get through the mess that day.

2nd day comes and I sit in the traffic for a little bit - then say, 'Fuck this running.'.  I get into the right lane and ride it to about a 1/4 mile before the bridge and merge in.

3 months.  3 fucking months there was that construction.  During those 3 months every damned day I ignored the merge signs until a 1/4 mile before the bridge.  The position of the signs never changed.  Traffic never wised up.

Now here is the thing.  People didn't get agitated - they got full-on pissed off.  Every day in this traffic I got stares from assholes in the left lane.  People in cars would do things like cut me off just before I passed them.  I got honked at.

Truck drivers.  Holy shit truck drivers.  They would drive in the right lane and keep pace with the left lane so people like me had no ability to take advantage of the empty lane.

I was still dealing with those feelings since it's my first time actually liking a guy(newly bisexual). After a few weeks of pondering what to do with these feelings I finally decided to confess my feelings to him. To set the scene we all attend college together and so we all see each other in passing. I hang out with a few different people at the school but I mainly hang out with a group of guy friends. The guy friend I'm crushing on is part of this group. 

So, a few weeks ago one of my friends who I've been getting to know recently  broke up with her boyfriend. She admitted to me that before she officially broke up with him she went and basically cheated on him. She explained that she was already done with the relationship so that's why she did it. I'm not neccesarily one to judge since it's not my relationship so I didnt give my input. Though I do understand that her ex wasnt a hundred percent innocent but two wrongs dont make a right.

Eventually our class starts and we begin to walk away but she calls me over as they walk away. She asks me point blank if my guy friend was single. I didnt know how to respond since he was but it's a bit more complicated since I liked him. I told her that I'd talk to her later about it. 

With her wanting to start something with him, it sort of kicked my ass in gear. After our class him and I walked backed to the parking structure. I told him that I was developing feelings for him. He didnt recuperate my feelings but I personally dont feel like it was an outright no.

We were both excited to have a place together, saving money, and be 2 minutes away from work. I was a bit nervous to move in but not nearly nervous enough for it to be a reason not to. 
Rewind to January my gf shares a picture of a dog staying at a foster house in town. I love the dog immediately. But, I shrugged it off. I was in the army and had too much going on and he was too cute. Someone was surely about to adopt him. 
Over the months I found myself looking at puppies for sale in my area more and more. Months go by and my contract ends in the army and I get out. My life has slowed down some and I still look at puppies constantly. 
Fast forward to a month ago. I see another post about said cute dog. (4th or 5th one since the original one). How has no one given him a home yet?? So I schedule a time for me to at least come play with him at the foster home. When I got there we bonded like we were old friends. He was such a sweet dog. Turns out he was picked up in a different town and taken to the pound there as a puppy. The pound was run by local inmates and ran unchecked for years. My dog didn’t leave his cage once for two years and had heart worms. The situation was so awful that the state shut down the entire operation and sent every dog to another county. He ended up in a foster house in my town. Where he got to finally run and play, drink clean water, and get his shots/heart worm medicine. But, he couldn’t stay long. He needed a forever home. 
The problem is, is my gf’s house doesn’t allowed pets AT ALL. When I tell her I have to save this dog and make him mine she takes it as I’m trying to find a way to not move in. Which isn’t it at all. So we fought. She’s upset about me not being able to move in if I adopt the dog and I’m upset because I now have to choose. Clearly I made my choice and it wasn’t out of fear of commitment. I just couldn’t say no to the little guy. AITA???",Omg this is hard But I’m going with YTA I get that you want to rescue the dog but where’s your commitment with your girlfriend?

They asked what was in the frittata and I told them one was goat cheese, tomato, asparagus. One was bacon, cheddar, mushroom. They said since their 4 year old son is coming could I make him a plain one. 

I explained each frittata is pretty big as it’s made in a pan and I’d hate to subject everyone else to eating a boring one instead of a flavorful one (I only had the ingredients and time to make the ones I’d planned to so would have to scrap one in favor of the plain one.)

She asked if I could throw together a cheese sandwich or plain scrambled eggs for her kid and I said I couldn’t. She got offended and basically said why did you invite us over if you weren’t prepared to host people and I said I’m prepared to serve everyone *a* dinner but it’s a hassle to do a whole separate thing. 

She did tell me her kid was coming well in advance, but I didn’t know they were a picky eater until then.

Looking back now I feel badly because I know I could’ve just made the kid something like plain scrambled eggs and I didn’t do it because I didn’t feel like going out of my way.

This is my bro’s FIRST relationship & I’m worried it’s moved WAY too fast. He goes to school w M, he comes home & M’s here. His BFF hasn’t seen him in months. He never leaves the house without M & barely leaves in general. BFF has invited bro over many times & bro won’t go because M wants to go even though M isn’t invited.
Called bro from uni to ask if we could have a night alone to hang out bc I worked all summer & didn’t get to spend time w him, to hear him ASK M PERMISSION, WITHOUT explaining for what, bc M was eavesdropping on our call. 
M is attempting to surpass my standing in my family. Parents separated when we were young, I moved in with my father permanently when I was 13. Bro goes back & forth. I’ve been working & contributing to the household (paying bills, buying groceries) since I was 12. Through highschool I worked 20-35 hrs / week to help out while we were on EI. I took care of smaller expenses so EI covered major bills. Even from uni I make all appointments, etc. I’m the equivalent of a mother / wife. M has now come in attempting to assert dominance, not understanding that I am the anchor of this family.
Came home from work many times to find M had gone through my room looking for things.
Came home from uni to find M’s things in my bedroom bc there “wasn’t enough room” in bro’s room.
Got home to find M had taken my shelf in the shower, which has always been mine, I moved her products, & replaced mine bc that’s my space; now been in a back & forth where M’s been taking my things out of the shower & replacing her own.
M doesn’t have a job but continually eats / drinks the food I bring home for myself knowing its mine.
Measures of my accomplishments once displayed in our living room (valedictorian award, grad cap, honour roll certifictes, university acceptance letters) are all on my bedroom floor so M could put her cadet boots up.

I would have been 15 at the time of the first incident, she would have her stuff all over the bathroom (shared by both of us) and would constantly spill makeup and oral care products over the counter. I'd ask her to clean it up and she would say yes and continue to never do it. This would go back and forth continuing the same pattern over a couple weeks. Until one day I got my mother involved to ask her to clean in, in which she hesitantly obliged.

3347,"AITA for not letting my best friend take her girlfriend to birthday party? Okay so first off I just wanna say that English is not my first language. But you're welcome to correct any mistakes I make.

&#x200B;

So here is a bit of background to the situation. Last year my best friend, let us call her Tina, and I were friends with benefits, and I ended up falling in love with her (I already had feelings for her before we were FWB). To make a long story short she ended without telling me and I was obviously crushed by this. 2 or 3 months after it ended she got with her current girlfriend, and I thought I was over her. So the three of us went to a bar (before we went out I promised not to talk about certain things to Tina's new girlfriend) and I got very drunk thus breaking the promise I made to Tina. That night I was just an asshole, I know that. I also felt like the worst friend for breaking the trust between us.

&#x200B;

So fast forward to now. I just turned 18 and I'm planning my 18th birthday party. I've invited basically all of my friends and Tina. Now Tina and I don't have the same group of friends, so I'm basically the only one she knows at my party. So she asked me if she could bring her girlfriend to my party so she would have one to talk other than me. Now I completely understand this. Only knowing one person at a party is very awkward and not so fun, but from the looks of it, there aren't gonna be that many at my party and all of my friends a very open and friendly. The problem I have with Tina bringing her GF to the party is that I'm afraid I'm gonna do something stupid again thus breaking our trust again. Where I live, when you turn 18 and you host a party EVERYONE just purs alcohol in you and around midnight you take 18 shots. So you can imagine I'm prob gonna be wasted, which just increases my fear of doing something stupid. And Tina is like:

''No you aren't gonna do something stupid.''

''You had feelings for me back then and were probably jealous.''

''The relationship was new back then.''

This doesn't reduce my fear. This is a big deal to me and I feel like she just thinks this is nothing or are just some nerves from last time. When in reality I'm so anxious about it. When I asked if she would still come to my party if her GF couldn't come, she said yes but probably not drink and leave. I kinda feel like she guilting me into letting her GF come.

I just don't know what to do because I know how much it sucks to only know one person at a party but I also know this is a great way for her to make more friends and get to know my other friends.

So Reddit AITA if I say ''No, you can't bring your GF to my party''?

I’ve stayed home since she was born and lately I’ve been asking hubby about hiring a part time nanny so I can get a break in the mornings. He refused saying that looking after the child is my only job and it makes no sense for us to hire someone while I don’t bring in any income.

After that, we kind of lost track of each other—not out of any animosity, but because we lived in different cities and our lives naturally headed in different directions.

But about eight months ago, we got the chance to reconnect when Chloe invited me to her wedding. I went with several other high school friends and had a blast. We're all mid-30s now. Chloe and I had a couple of good catch-up convos during that weekend.

Since then, Chloe has been putting in a lot of effort to rekindle a friendship with me—lots of texts, emails, and recently she's been angling to visit me. While I appreciate her efforts and feel only warm feelings toward her, I'm having a hard time summoning much enthusiasm for this friendship. It's been almost 15 years since we were anything resembling ""close friends,"" and it feels unnatural and forced to act like we're chummy again all of a sudden. In many ways she's a stranger to me now. So I've been a little aloof in my behavior—sometimes will take a couple days to respond, or won't respond at all.

Recently, though, she's been pushing harder on this visit idea. She wants to come to my city for a weekend.

I'd be cool having dinner with her, or seeing each other in a group, but a full weekend together is too much. So every time she proposes a date, I come up with a vague excuse, hoping she'll drop it.

I usually live my life separate of her but the holidays make it hard because I’m around her more often. I think the coldness for my sister has come from years of watching my sister use and abuse my parents. But that is their choice. Letting go is easier said then done. 

I’m 33 my sister is 37. I’ve been married for 10 years. I have 3 kids 5 and under. My sister has a son in kinder. She goes to college so financial aide will pay for leisure activities. My dad pays her bills. She has lived with him except for the last few months she’s lived with her current boyfriend but they are moving back in with my dad because his divorce is finalized and they have to sell his house. My parents take her kid all the time. She planned a trip to Vegas with all the bells and whistles and didn’t even check with our parents before booking everything because she knew they would take him. I don’t think my husband and I have been away from our kids overnight in 3 years (not complaining we have a lot of small kids). My husband’s parents live outta state and my dad has always been mia with me. My mom hasn’t been able to help with my kids because she is always taking care of my sister’s son and then is “too tired”. Side bar: my uncle gave my sister $12,000 to pay off school and she threw it away. So my mom paid of school (not knowing about my uncle’s money) so she could register for classes.

3367,"AITA for not contacting an old friend after her mom died? I’ve known this person for 17 years. For most of that we were really good friends. Probably best friends at one point. She introduced me to my now husband, was the maid of honor at our wedding, and overall was a good friend to us. However like most friendships we started drifting apart. She started making a lot of money at her current job and buying designer labels. She started dating a wealthy guy. She came to visit a couple of years ago and the visit did not go well; my husband and I aren’t in the best financial situation and we both felt they made the trip all about them and went out of their way to shove their money in our faces. My husband brought it up after she told him how much she enjoyed the trip and let her know how we really felt. She didn’t take it well. She and my husband mended fences but she unfriended me on social media and we’ve had no contact.

Her mother died three months ago. My husband went to the funeral (I expected as much because he’s been friends with her since middle school) but I saw no reason to go back. I told him to hug her for me but didn’t contact her. I also didn’t sign the card my husband sent. My husband today told me that I’m the asshole for not even bothering to send condolences or message her and apparently she was pissed that I never reached out to her due to our previous friendship and knowing her mom personally. My view is that the friendship is over so I have no reason to call her personally; I sent condolences through my husband. My husband still said it’s a horrible run for me to have done considering our history and that at one point they were like family and he thought I’d at least signed the card. To me, once ties are cut they’re cut. In my opinion, I don’t owe her a thing.

So you're acknowledging that you deliberately didn't sign the card out of pettiness, when you know it must have been hurtful to her? The fact that your husband was willing to put in an appearance at the funeral and you weren't, even though you've both been through the same things with this friend, suggests he has a better attitude than you.

Manager = manager

Friday afternoon a former co-worker stopped by to say hello. She is speaking with my manager and as I'm walking up to them I hear FC say, she is two days past her due date. I say my hellos, look at her belly and say, enthusiastically, ""wow, you're massive!"" Manager who is an outspoken bitch, says in a sarcastic way, ""wow, underwatercarpet, that was really rude!"" FC makes a face and says ""thanks..."" while laughing a bit. I stammer out, ""I didn't mean it like that!"", to which there was only uncomfortable laughter, so I laugh it off and walk away. FC does not say goodbye when she leaves. Manager comes up to me later and says ""remember that time you called FC fat?"" I honestly asked if that wasn't what you're supposed to say? I mean she does have a human inside her. Manager doesn't say much else and leaves me to ponder. I don't feel like a dick for saying it as I'm sure they understood what I meant, but I do think if my manager hadn't said anything I wouldn't be wondering.

Background context:

&#x200B;

FC and I weren't super close, but seeing as we worked in close proximity, we had a friendly acquaintanceship. She was already 6 months along when she started at the company and was very vocal about being quite visibly and heavily pregnant at 6 months. Now, I'm not the type to play into people fishing for compliments, so I wouldn't say anything when she'd say things like ""can't wait to get skinny again"" or ""none of my clothes fit me anymore"" or ""I feel like a blimp"". Her personality was very lax and nothing bothered her, so her reaction was a bit odd from what I'd seen of her previously.

&#x200B;

Even if someone is pregnant, they still don't want to be perceived as massive.. It's common sense unless you really know the person and know they won't take it offensively.

Then was ignored by her texts for 7 hours the last day we have together to speak, before our trips, and I told her to have a good trip. 


My girlfriend is going on a 6 day trip where she may have no internet connection, a cruise. I'm going on a 3 day trip and she leaves on the 2nd day of my trip. We saw each other on 4th of July, very happy, didn't say bye like it was a week long goodbye though, I assumed we would see each other next the day (today, last day I have before my trip).

Anywho, a little more backstory, I would often come by for a couple seconds to give her stuff, sprite and DQ blizzards. The last time before today, I said I was tired of feeling unwelcome when I go, she said she was sorry and promised it would never happen again. Today it happened again, she's big on breaking promises btw if that's important.

With that in mind, I went to get her a blizzard with my last dollars before I get paid again, I go to her house and she gives me the most awkward thank you and goodbye, no hug and no kiss even though it's the last time we have to see each other, because she didn't want to in front of her aunt. 

I should've mentioned earlier that I asked her to go to the movies today, like a week before hand, and her mother ended up feeling weird about it last minute and saying no.  I should also state were only 16.

3376,"AITA for confessing to my childhood best friend that I love her? I(26M) have been in love with my childhood best friend (26F) for at least half a decade now. We were inseparable. 
She is intelligent, witty and breathtakingly beautiful. I sort of made a promise to be just friends with her at the start of high school since everyone was just hitting on her and very few geniunely cared about her feelings. We were super close friends. Shared every little thing with each other and got accepted to the same college for undergrad.

I got the opportunity to go study MBA at my dream school abroad, so I honestly just went for it. I was super busy during this point in time and she was doing her own thing too...so we unfortunately drifted apart. I knew then that I missed her dearly and had deep romantic feelings for her.

I did receive a lot of offers, but I didn't go on any dates during this span of time. It's not something I am proudly saying or anything, I just geniunely wanted to have a future with her.

Last last month, I finally got to meet her after finishing my degree. I took her to the beach, made her favorite food for her and just talked about how I was attracted to her romantically and would be grateful if she considered ever going out with me. I also said I was fine if we were friends too, I could handle it. Obviously it would sting but in the end just having her in my life meant a lot.

She didn't say anything at first, but then shouted at me saying I had betrayed her trust and broken up her promise.
She said it wouldn't work out and ghosted me.

I honestly just...don't even remember the past month at all. I feel half dead. I blame myself for ruining something and feel like an idiot. I didn't know so much would have changed when I came back after doing my degree.

When I barely started doing something productive yesterday, her girl friend hit me up on Instagram.

she told me that I had turned out like the person I swore to never be for her, sent me this paragraph long message of how I was just really toxic and obsessive.

I feel really down again. I don't want you guys to go easy on me or anything, I just want the truth.  

Your perspective would mean a lot.

Edit: I think I should also make one more thing clear. I didn't want to since it was very personal to me... but this is an online forum and everyone is being so honest so I think I should be honest with you too.
The reason I returned to my country was also because my mother was terribly Ill. She unfortunately passed away, but before dying told me to not regret anything I do. At that point in time, that meant confessing my feelings.... So while I was very gentle with her and brought it up for only a minute as a thing to consider, I do realize that I wasn't in the right mental state.

This is going to be controversial, but you were absolutely an asshole.  Not only to her, but to yourself.  You deprived yourself of many opportunities to find someone who you could love and would love you back, and set them aside for a fantasy that you knew wasn't likely to ever happen.  You spent how many years apart forsaking all of the opportunities in front of you for someone you hadn't talked to in how long?  

I don't think being honest about your feelings is being a huge asshole to her.

3379,"AITA for reneging on dog-sitting for my friend? I (30m) have a friend (34m) that I met 5 years ago through my last job. He and his wife (38f) have a couple of pit bulls that they spoil beyond reason. They are fur-babies, and they treat them like their own children. While he works at a job he hates, she stays at home to watch the dogs and take care of their toddler (1.5m). About 4 years ago they asked me if I could dog sit for them while they went out of town on a weekend getaway. I agreed, and admittedly, forgot. I booked a nonrefundable flight to see my then-girlfriend that same weekend. Thinking there would be a reasonable alternative like they would just kennel the dogs that weekend, I went to see my girlfriend. My friend got his dad to drive from Ohio to Texas to dog sit for them in my stead. I felt I was clearly in the wrong then, and told them as much.

About a month ago, he asked if I could dog/house sit one weekend sometime this summer while they house hunt. I agreed. When I told him about the new job I was starting, he just asked if that meant I would have the vacation days to use to dog sit for them. Uh, excuse me? I told him on Monday that I was sorry but he should probably find an alternative, and I felt pressured into agreeing and hopefully there was a reasonable amount of time between now and then. He told me he understood, and he said it didn't matter because he doesn't know details of dates anyway. They have plenty of time to find an alternative. I get a text an hour later from his wife (in a group chat with all three of us) that says ""I cannot believe you are doing this to us AGAIN!! You are a bad friend"". I responded ""Well that's a bit extreme"" and have not heard anything else about it from either of them. I did notice she unfriended me on facebook. The horror.

I do not feel at all in the wrong, I have never asked them for any favors, offered on several occasions for them to come have dinner at my place (they decline, citing inability to leave or bring the dogs), helped them move (they said it was to move but it was to PACK their filthy unorganized house), and I feel it's an unreasonable request to sacrifice my time off work because of your refusal to kennel the dogs for any amount of time. I am not dicking them over, and I don't feel I owe them anything.

Finally, I've been disrespected from both of them before and had jokes made at my expense for being millenial, snowflake, entitled, bad at my job, nicknamed ""Kelso"", etc, which I shrugged off because, well, I know they were wrong and am not about to prove them otherwise.

He broke up with his gf that day and for 6 months did anything and everything to prove himself to me. He really wore me down and I fell in love with him.

It took us about a month to finally have his funeral. But a few days before I got a message on Facebook from his ex. She wanted to know if she was welcome to come. I was polite but told her I didn’t think it was appropriate and I didn’t know if I could handle it. She just said ok.

Little backstory, I was stationed in Turkey in 2010 when I met my gf (now wife) on base.  We went out more than a few times but this one situation STILL GIVES ME FLASHBACKS!

At one of our dates, we go to this open air cafe.  Instead of normal sitting chairs and tables, this cafe has large couches (the kind you can really lean back) plus large and long tables that are only about knee high.

He even took my order! I also made sure when I handed him my money to 'accidentally' brush my finger on his hand, and it was so exciting, it gave me butterflies!

I took mental note of his name, and on the way home found him on Facebook. He was the first person who popped up after writing his name, so it's not like I was 'hunting' for him. I didn't want to forget what he looked like so I saved his profile picture (only picture I could get of him without friending him).

Today my friend came over and was on my phone and saw the picture. She asked me who the guy was and I told her the story and she said that I was really creepy and should delete the photo. At first I said no and she started to get pissed off, so then I did. But when she left I just redownloaded the photo again.

I don't understand though, I'm not harming him by having the photo, he doesn't even know i have it. And I'm not really into sex so it's not like I'm going to try anything with him, the photo's just a bit of eye candy.

I think my friend's overreacting, but I want to know if she's got a valid point or not. So AITA?","YTA If this was a man talking about a woman, the level of creepy would be instantly off the charts for most people.

3395,"WIBTA if I rehomed my mother's cat? My (33f) mother (63f) has 3 cats, all about 10 years old.  Originally, 1 was my sister's (30f) and 2 were mine.   As a result of my and my sister's life changes, the cats now live with our mother.  She loves them, has claimed them as her own, and has made it clear that we aren't getting any cats back.  That is fine with both my sister and me - we are grateful for her taking the cats when we couldn't and we still get to see them when we visit. 

However, the cats do not get along.  They generally ignore/tolerate each other, but have little growling, clawing spats on a daily basis.  My mother all too often gets in the middle and gets hurt.  One cat (one of my former cats) is particularly prone to scratching and biting, not just when provoked by the other cats.  If you pet her wrong or just get in her way you're liable to get nipped. 

It's been twice now that the cat has bit my mom really bad - deep puncture marks in her arm.  The critical detail here is that as a result of cancer surgery, she no longer has lymph nodes in her right arm, the arm that has received both bites.   The first bite sent her to the hospital for 3 days, her arm swollen triple it's normal size, as they administered IV antibiotics and monitored her to make sure her body could actually fight the infection.  The doctor scolded her, ""you could lose a hand. ""  Fortunately, the second time wasn't so bad, but that doesn't mean the third time couldn't cost her a limb.

My mom's solution is to try and remember to reach out with her left arm.  She loves the dang cat and feels like a round of antibiotics is worth keeping it around.  I don't think she fully, consciously, realizes how much of a real threat to her safety the cat, unfortunately, is.  I feel like the cat is an extreme liability and am having trouble in good conscience doing nothing.

3398,"AITA if I continue to use our pontoon boat? Hello. So we live on a private, no wake lake in Michigan. We have a 14 foot pontoon boat with a 40hp Yamaha engine. We have owned this boat for about 3-4 years now and enjoy using it. Although the engine can easily make a wake, we only use it at trolling speed. There are about 3-4 other gas pontoon boats on the lake, and another 3-4 electric pontoon boats on the lake.

As of this past weekend, we received an email from one of our neighbors that went out to all of our neighbors stating that they saw a little bit of oil/gas residue near their shoreline and it is a concern to them.

Mind you, we have looked into downsizing our 40hp to a 20hp, and we have also looked into downsizing to an electric motor. The problem is, a new gas motor is only around $3,500USD. A new electric motor is around $10,000USD. That’s not in the budget for us currently, and I believe you should expect something like that on your shoreline from time to time if you live on a lake with motor-crafts on it.

3406,"AITA for not speaking up when my girlfriend lied about being called n-word after an accident? Her lie definitely swung the cops judgement in her favor. About three weeks ago, girlfriend was driving while I was a passenger. We were at a four way stop and if I'm being totally honest, I think she went when it wasn't her turn but it was really close and her car and the other guys hit each other at an angle so it was really hard to tell who was at fault. 

My girlfriend is about 3/4 African American but still somewhat light skinned. When we got out of the car, the other guy was an older man who was clearly agitated but as god as my witness I did not hear him say anything rude, let alone derogatory towards my girlfriend's race. He had called the police even before getting out of the car and I think it took them less than 10 minutes to get there. My girlfriend sat in her car calling her parents while the other guy and I did our best to redirect traffic around the two cars. 

When the police came up my girlfriend instantly went from calm and collected to tears streaming down her face when they asked her what happened she said that she saw the other guy look at her and then from her perspective hit her car on purpose. She also said that as soon as he got out of the car he started screaming at her things like ""this is why m*****'s shouldn't be behind the wheel and that she's an n-word who would be better in chains among other things. I was speechless (and spineless) and kept telling myself ""say something, just say something"" but never did. 


This clearly set the cops in her favor and the guy was ticketed for running the four way stop. The cops actually never even asked me what I saw and of course the other guy denied everything and actually looked like he was about to break out in tears and said that he was a retired school counselor and would never even imagine to say such words. I think there was something about my girlfriend being young and pretty that the cop was far more willing to take her side. 


The other guy was ticketed for running a stop sign, was found at fault for the accident and her insurance company is actively seeking his company to pay for the entire accident which I assume will mean his premiums will skyrocket. We also have some sort of laws in our state about elderly people requiring super expensive driving exams if they cause an accident so this guy may even lose his independence over this. I am literally sleepless over this.

3407,"AITA for getting my daughter to hang out with other children in the neighbourhood? My daughter Amy is... different. From a very early age she displayed behavioural issues such as stealing and violent behaviour and was completely defiant to me and my husband. We sought help for this and Amy has had help from specialists for many years which has made a world of difference. 

Unfortunately Amy is incapable of empathy or remorse and there's nothing we can do about that. She does not frighten easily and openly admits that she does not love or care about us which is heartbreaking. Nevertheless she is logical enough to understand that actions have consequences and that she will be punished if she acts out. Amy is very intelligent and is advanced for her age across the board. 

Amy is very charming however. She makes friends very easily and at home speaks in a very ''adult'' sort of way. She can easily hold her own in conversations with adult relatives and family friends but at the same time can act her age and when with her friends speaks like any other 13 year old girl. Her friends parents all find her delightful. In spite of her issues Amy is not that different from anyone else her age and even came up to me the other day asking for advice on a boy she had a crush on, which brought tears to my eyes since it was the first time I've seen that kind of vulnerability from her. 

We also have an 11 year old son, Ryan. Ryan often hangs out with a few boys and girls who live on our street. Amy has no interest in this sort of thing but recently a group of kids from another street have been coming to steal the ball that Ryan and his friends use. I asked Amy if she'd be willing to hang out outside with them and then call me if any trouble starts. 

Yesterday Ryan came running up to the door, saying that Amy was hurt and that I needed to come and see. I found Amy on the floor bleeding and crying in pain. She was severely injured, with the worst being a broken arm. I called an ambulance and she was taken to hospital. 

Ryan told me what happened. Apparently Amy started encouraging Ryan and his friends to go after the bullies and start a fight with them for the ball. They did this, unfortunately one of the bullies had an older sister who came and attacked Amy. Amy said this was all true. 

I feel so guilty. Amy's care plan makes clear that she is not to be left among younger children as she is a danger to them. I took my eye off the ball and thought no harm could happen, and she provoked a fight and got herself severely injured.

3421,"AITA for distancing myself from my grandfather while his health is failing   I've been struggling with this decision for over a year now. Back-story first. My Grandfather is not biological (potential relevancy) , he is my grandmothers 2nd husband but they were married before I was born, so he has been grandpa my whole life. He and my grandmother took myself and my 2 siblings  in when our parents were no longer fit to raise us (drug addictions and prison sentences).  They sacrificed the 1st 4 years of retirement to raise us. 

Fast forward to now, siblings and I are in our thirties and happily married with our own homes. 

Grandma is 90+, Grandpa is 87. At around 80 he started showing signs of dementia. Symptoms have gotten worse as time has passed. In the past 2 years, several major events have occurred. He was arrested for DUI and public indecency after exposing himself at the local veterans club. The nexus of this event occurred when my 90 year old grandmother refused to have sex with him so he decided he would go ""pick up the bar maid"" at the club.

He has since propositioned for sex  2 of my great aunts, my mother, my aunt, my sister, and several of his female neighbors. No female in my family is comfortable around him. He asks for them to sit on his lap at every holiday and says not to worry if ""anything pops up"". He makes constant lewd comments about everyones bodies and cannot carry on a conversation for more than 30 seconds without sexual innuendo. 

My grandmother has called crying about him being threatening and verbally abusive to her for declining his advances. She is barely mobile and has multiple health issues, so beyond just being ""over it"" sexually, there are health risks.  

Around a year ago I confronted him upon learning he had propositioned my mother. He claimed it was completely normal since she wasn't his biological daughter. I disagreed and let my emotions get the better of me and lashed out at him. Our relationship has pretty much disappeared since then. I used to talk to him at least weekly, for decades...since the confrontation its only been forced awkward interactions at holidays. 

I realize that his health and mental condition play a major role in how everything has played out, and the guilt I carry for our current situation is huge. I owe my life to him, but he is no longer the man I thought he was. I feel like I am angry at him for a disease that is beyond his control to some extent. Almost like I am abandoning him at his time of greatest need. But watching the man I looked up to turn into a loathsome pervert has been too much to bear. 

TL;DR - Grandpa sacrificed greatly to make my life better but has recently (after dementia diagnosis) become wildly inappropriate with all females. Confronted him about it and now relationship is in shambles.

I appreciate the feedback and input from everyone, it helps. 
To clarify some things, he is on medication and my grandma administers it daily. My mom and aunt have started to attend the doctor visits with them to help monitor.
In home care was tried briefly (about 2 months) and my grandpa didnt react well to ""strangers"" in his house.
Made some veiled threats about ""accidentally"" shooting Intruders so everything immediately stopped. We've taken all the pistols out of the home as well as the ammo to his hunting rifles, which has caused pretty significant backlash that my grandma bears the brunt of.
We as a family have discussed getting social workers involved but are concerned with what he might do if cornered...either to himself or my grandmother. And my grandma has also asked all of us not to do anything because she doesnt want to ""make waves""...which to me is a huge red flag for someone being abused. I call her regularly and try to keep a close eye on everything, but they dont live close so I'm afraid I may not be seeing the whole picture.","YTA

See if you can talk to your grandmother again about what is going on. Next step after that might be to schedule an appointment with your grandfather's doctor.

Im currently with my SO of two years living downtown in a populated city. We have been living together for 7 months now on a one year lease which amounts to $1095/mo. We currently have that split at half and have agreed to this since before even looking for apartments. She works 30h a week at a bank that makes a bit over $17/hr. Which totals to about $30k a year with some OT. I'm an engineer for our city and make over double what she does per hour and almost push 6 figures. 

Lately she feels it's not fair to her that she has to pay half when I make a good deal amount more than her. I don't feel that's fair or equal, nor do I feel I should have to. Since before moving together, I volunteered to pay the utilities, groceries, and any other upkeep type costs. And I have and still plan to. I also don't feel I should morally have to pay more in this scenario because I I chose a career path that made money, went through schooling, licensing, internships, etc to get to where I am. Where she honestly has kinda settled where she's at when she had the full opportunity to go to school (Her parents offered to pay for it if she maintained decent grades). She says she's content where she works at and the level she's on; which I'm happy for her on that and support. But feel I shouldn't have to pay more because I choose to pursue and work towards positions of higher pay and status.

Additionally, she does have disposable income. After rent for the month, she has over $900 to spend on any other expenses that aren't bills and groceries. She does have a building savings. And I even spend money on her when I want to surprise her. Two weeks ago I bought a pallette for her that was $120. So I'm not stingy with my money.

>YTA. You earn 3x what she does, you should be paying expenses proportionally to what you earn. Groceries and utilities doesn’t make up for that. She’s your partner, not your roommate

Thank you for that. I guess I never really thought about it like that but it does seem like I'm treating this more as a roommate scenario in some regards. I do need to work on that. And as for bills and groceries, totaling it up, it comes close to the ""proportional amount"" that'd be reached via income. As I have a 4k calorie/day high protein diet and she enjoys furthering her culinary skills with some more expensive (And damn tasty) foods. So those expenses do come out to about 2/3 on my part.

We're maintaining both of our standards, but mostly hers. I took a downgrade from where I used to live due to me not finding it fair to pay more for my standard of living. I also took a longer commute so she could have a shorter commute.


>YTA because you think you’re better than her: “Where she honestly has kinda settled where she's at” “ But feel I shouldn't have to pay more because I choose to pursue and work towards positions of higher pay and status“

Not at all. It's to point my thought on the feeling of paying more when I choose to pursue where she in the long run will pay less and less because she doesn't want to pursue and wants to remain where she's at. It's almost like a negative aspect that I have to pay more if I want to keep climbing rungs. And I've said I'm happy she's happy with where she's at. I support her. I don't try to badger her to keep going. I'd be an ass if I did.","YTA. You earn 3x what she does, you should be paying expenses proportionally to what you earn. Groceries and utilities doesn’t make up for that. She’s your partner, not your roommate. If you get married, do you plan to continue expecting her to pay exactly half of everything regardless of what you make? I guess if you only see this as a short term relationship, keep it up, but if not she’s right to wonder why you’re treating her like a random Craigslist roommate.",1,YTA,0.0,0.0,0
3430,"AITA for just disappearing for a month. I’m 33 year old woman, I have a 16 year old son. I’m not in a relationship with his father. Our son has some mental problems and he spent few months in mental hospital. When he came back he seemed to be a lot better. He was taking his medicine, hanging out with his friends. He also made a new friend at hospital. 17 y.o boy. That boy lives closer to me, so when my son stayed with me(weekends), they’d hang out at my house. They were really close. 

Then they started fighting about something, I still don’t know what, and my son was incredibly stressed. I could hear him crying in his room, I tried to talk to him but he refused to. Me and his dad talked, we decided it would be best if he spent more time at his home, so he wouldn’t have to see his friend. 

It was fine for first two weeks, then he said he wanted to see his friend. We said it would be better if they didn’t see each other. He got really upset over that, but we told him that our decision was final. He started throwing tantrum and breaking stuff in his room. Next day he snuck out to see him and we caught him. We grounded him and took his electronics. He went mad at that point, he broke literally everything in his room.


I was just so damn tired, I couldn’t do it anymore. I couldn’t even talk to him. I told his dad that if he needed anything he could contact my parents and left. I went to another city and stayed there. I had 0 contact with my son or his dad. I got back after a month. My son just looked at me and acted like he didn’t see me.

3437,"AITA for pressuring my SO to quit her job? My SO and I have been together for more than a decade. We are childless, unmarried, and unburdened by debts, so the only reason we have to stay together is because we want to be.

She's a cook and is currently working for some relatives' organization on a gig-by-gig basis. She cooks all meals for groups of people that stay temporarily in a place run by them. Sometimes it's for a couple of days, sometimes it's more than a week, with varying frequency: she might do nothing in two months, and then have 3 gigs in a row.

She loves this job. She has free reign, and it was tailored for her. She even helped designing the kitchen. At first it was only her but now she has an assistant she's become pretty closed to. She has made friends among the organization as well. It also came at a time when we had money issues so we were grateful for it.

There is, however, a series of problems. First of all, her place of work is very far away so she has to stay there for the duration of each job. Which wouldn't be an issue if not for the fact she doesn't have a regular place to stay. Sometimes there's a room available in that place but if not she has to crash somewhere, suitcase in toll. Which could be fixed if not because it's not a well-paid job so we can't afford her own place there.

There are two much bigger issues, though. One, my SO has a physical condition that makes her tired most of the time. She still can work but so much moving around is pushing it. Each time she comes back from a job she stays longer in bed, and she's close to maxxing her meds. And two, this job is straining our relationship. As I said we are together because we want to be together, and yet this thing is keeping us apart sometimes for almost full months at a time. I not only never wanted a long-distance relationship but also living alone makes me anxious and ultimately affects my health, all of which she knows.

Before someone asks, moving there is not an option. Right now we live in a decent apartment of a mid-sized city, I have a full-time job, and we are close to all services and doctors we need for our conditions. She works in a small town in the middle of nowhere with very few job prospects for me, limited rental options, and far from specialized care centers. None of us want that.

I've made myself very clear I want her to quit for both our sakes. She agrees with me but says she doesn't want to leave them in the lurch, so she has volunteered to find and train a replacement. However, not only nobody has looked for any candidates yet, she has also already agreed to do more jobs for the next sixth months. I understand she has a hard time with this because she likes it there, and she doesn't want conflict with her relatives who, after all, gave her the job. However, at the end of the day it is not her company or her responsibility, and any moral debt has been sufficiently paid, so I'm pressuring her to give a very short notice and leave. AITA?","YTA.  I don't think you're being one intentionally, but nothing you said in your post makes it clear that she wants to quit.  In fact, it sounds like the opposite-- she loves the job, it's tailored for her, she has lots of close friends...

Instead of framing it as better for both of you, have an honest conversation about your own feelings.  And give her an opportunity to tell you how she feels.

As you probably don’t know, I’m pretty good at bowling. My parents made me play it ever since I was 8. I’m not a pro, or anything, but I consistently score in the mid-200s. I recently got my wife into bowling. She’s not the best. I wasn’t any good when I was 8, to be fair. She really wants to impress me by getting over a hundred. We were practicing on her technique, when she scored 3 gutter balls in a row.

I honestly didn’t think she would get that defensive. We slept over it. Then next week, we were bowling again. She brought up that incident once more. I’m not a believer in bringing up past arguments in current arguments, so I honestly got a bit mad. I just bowled, and didn’t help her. I feel really shitty for doing that to my wife.

3449,"AITA for accepting a minority scholarship when I’m mostly white? I go to a state college which charges a lot of money for tuition. So much money, in fact, that my (pretty large) family would not be able to afford the full price of attendance. Luckily, I was able to earn two scholarships that, when combined, amount to around half the price of tuition. 
Here's the thing though-about one third of that scholarship money comes from a scholarship meant for minorities. 
In terms of heritage, I identify as white. Percentage wise, I am half ethnically Jewish, which doesn't count for anything, and about half assorted European or just plain white. But I am also 1/16 Native American. My family doesn't know the exact percentage though, since the DNA tests we've taken have given vastly different results each time. But the heritage is definitely there-I own a tribal card and so does my dad and other siblings. There are pictures of my great gramma, who lived on a reservation, in full tribal attire. On the form for college application, I put ""Native American"" and ""White"" for the ethnicity column, because technically I fit the bill.
I personally think that you should take any money you can get from a college, especially because I have two younger, college bound siblings and I want them to be able to afford college as well. 
My older sister, who goes to the same school as me and has the same scholarship, thinks otherwise. She constantly reminds me that we are undeserving of the money, that we're taking money from real minorities who deserve it more. She also thinks that if you don't live the ""minority experience"", you don't deserve the money. She's even told me that she wants to pay back all the money she earned from the scholarship to the tribe we have heritage from, to ""make it up to them"".
I disagree, because I think the amount that my school charges for tuition is insane, and I'd rather not drive my family into debt because of some white guilt. 
But maybe my sister is right. Maybe I'm stealing from people who deserve it more. 
I'm not sure.

I own a business. I hired a man who became my best friend. Both me, him, and another employee of mine try to go out to a fancy restaurant every month, get slightly drunk, and talk about whatever. Music, politics, sports, ect. Stuff we imagine really snobby rich people do since we all came from modest backgrounds.

We call it white tie night, though we dont actually wear white ties. We also bring dates, i bring my wife. My wife set up my best friend with her sister, they are now married. Yadayada background over.

So this weekend was white tie night. My best friend, now brother in law, brings his wife my sister in law. We start drinking, having fun. The subject turns to the media and journalists.

I hate them. IMO they profit off of discontent and tragedy, theyre not out to report the truth theyre just out to report what gets the most clicks or views or whatever. I also hate the fact that you cant criticize their grossness without being called anti first amendment.

News flash, theyre billion dollar corporations, just like banks. They need to be critisized. I also think people who go into journalism are usually sociopaths who need to control what people see and how they view things. They want people to die and get hurt and they want people to fight. I view them like war profiteers. The movie Nightcrawler comes to mind.

Now i was also drunk like everyone else so i mightve been more passionate but it was white tie night and im around family and friends. Other people have ranted about politicians, celebrities, corporations, ect and even if we disagreed it was all in good fun.

At one point I was jealous about her going to dinner with some other guy instead of hanging out with me like we had planned (things were complicated) because she misunderstood me, and I was pretty upset because I really wanted to see her and so I said something passive aggressive about how she just didn't want to see me and then she blew up and that was our last fight before we decided to never talk to each other again.

We had a great day and all, but they brought it up again and I said I still stand by it. One of my flatmates said I should've just let them in, but my boyfriend said it was fine (he's seen them turn up sometimes half an hour early and made both of us rush before, so he understands).

3469,"AITA for missing rehearsals due to sleep deprivation? (Medium) Here's the story:

I was casted to play Aslan for Narnia (the great lion, leader of Narnia) a couple months back for a musical at my local theater. Everything was going fine, I had all my lines down, all the blocking, all the songs, everything.

I noticed that a couple of the nights when we were performing conflicted with my work schedule (I work nights, 10PM to 6AM), so I picked up extra shifts beforehand so I had those nights off, because I didn't want to run the risk of being late to work or god forbid miss a show.

As a result, at one point in time, I hadn't slept in 48+ hours. I was driving to a rehearsal after running some errands, and I began falling asleep at the wheel. I swerved, pulled over, and called a buddy so I could crash at his place. I slept through the rehearsal and woke up to tons of missed calls and texts from my director. She demanded I meet her at 1pm (which is not a normal rehearsal time, not what we agreed upon due to my schedule) and go over lines and blocking, which as I previously mentioned before, I had memorized.

I made the mistake of telling her I would be there, but as fate would have it, I got way too tired and slept before 1pm. I set alarms and timers, but it wasn't enough. I woke up around 3:30pm, and went directly to the theater. She wasn't there, and I later got a voicemail saying that I was being replaced as the lead role--3 DAYS BEFORE OUR OPENING NIGHT. Additionally, prior to all of this, I had not missed any rehearsals and even went to ones I wasn't supposed to be at, for extra practice.

The story goes a lot deeper, but those are the facts. I do feel kinda bad for missing the rehearsal and the 1 on 1 meeting, but I wasn't sure there was much I could do and I wanted to stay safe.

Am I the asshole here? I think I might be biased, so I tried to stick to the facts. Please let me know.

---------------EDIT: Some additional info:---------------

ABOUT THE DIRECTOR:

Our director was notorious for giving notes for up to 20-30 minutes at a time, and would do this twice or thrice per rehearsal when each rehearsal was only 2 hours long. She would yell at the little kids for blocking incorrectly after she gave them 3 different ways to do it and they were confused on which of the three to go with--because she never made up her mind. She would say the same thing 6 different ways, and often times took so long giving notes that by the time we actually got the chance to run the scene (IF WE EVEN GOT THAT FAR, WHICH WE OFTEN DIDN'T), we would have completely forgotten whatever she told us. This held true across the entire cast after talking with 19 different cast members. None of us cared for her. At all.

ABOUT ME:

I'm only two weeks away from quitting my night time job, due to school reasons. Additonally, I'm moving pretty far away from where the theater is located, so even if I got blacklisted from local theaters I seriously doubt where I'm going to be moving to will get word, and if it does, oh well. On with my life I'll go. Though I seriously doubt I'll get blacklisted because...

WHAT HAPPENED AFTER EVERYTHING:

To sugarcoat it, our director was a hellspawn. She made a rational choice with what happened with me and I get that, but outside of that situation, she was shit. Multiple complaints were made by an overwhelming majority of the cast, and as a result, she was fired, and believes it was my way of getting revenge for her decision.

 It turns out replacing cast members wasn't unusual for her-- she replaced two cast members on the spot after their mother called her and said they had to be home by 10pm, which means they had to leave by 9:30, and REHEARSALS WERE ONLY SUPPOSED TO RUN UNTIL 9. THAT WAS THE AGREED UPON TIME IN THE CONTRACT.

HOW THE SHOW WENT:

God awful.

My replacement WAS NOT AN UNDERSTUDY. My director pulled him from off the street only 3 days before opening night to catch him up to speed. The shows as I know are still going, the show itself is not fluid at ALL, there's no muscle memory and people missing their cues left and right due to the director's incompetence, and ironically, the person who delivered their lines the best was my replacement himself...because he carries his script on stage with him, in front of a packed audience.

Anyways, that's it. Message me if you've got any further questions","YTA big time. It's your fault you hadn't slept in 48 hours.

3479,"AITA for making fun of an abusive maniac/druggie after he died? There’s a coffee shop I go to that’s perfect with one exception - an angry, nutty customer named Joe. Our first encounter was a year and a half ago. I was on my way to the shop, and a car had been aggressively tailgating and honking at me for a long period of time (even though I was going at a perfect speed). The driver, Joe, blew past me unsafely & after I had parked my car and was about to get out, Joe confronted me.

He screamed foul obscenities at me, called me all sorts of names, and spat on me; all this was because he thought I was going “too fucking slow.” I complained to the coffee shop, but they did little. Over the past year and a half, I saw loads of crazy, dramatic and hotheaded behavior from him just like this. Additionally, he frequently seemed to be strung out or under the influence of drugs.

He got banned a few months ago after he sped through a nearby stop sign and nearly ran over a little girl. I hadn’t seen him since. Just yesterday, while browsing Facebook, I saw a long post from one of my friends (tagging the profile of someone named Joe in their post), saying things like “you’ll be missed” and “you’re now in heaven.” I saw the profile picture, & instantly recognized this “Joe” as the same asshole who I knew from the coffee shop. I clicked on his profile, & was surprised to see a large number of admirers gushing about his recent (past day) death on his wall - from a car wreck.

His page is an absolute mess. Every post looks like it as typed by a 2nd grader on crack; every other word is an obscenity; he does endless ranting about his family (he called his daughter a cu\*t in a recent post);brags about getting drunk & stoned; brags about the size of his (claimed) large anatomy and sexual capabilities; frequently picks fights with people in the comment sections of his posts and calls them names; & posts about his previous time in prison. I have never seen the word **lowlife** personified so perfectly.

I made a post on my page sharing a link to his profile, saying, “I am deeply saddened to hear of the passing of Joe \[last name\]. I have never seen a profile more indicative of a classy, eloquent, well-loved, respectable and law-abiding family man. I am **positive** his death had absolutely nothing to do at all with drugs, alcohol, manic driving, road rage or picking a fight with the wrong person - such a high class individual as him would **certainly** never engage in such behavior. I am certain that his family, who he has been so kind and decent towards, is mourning his death to the fullest. RIP to this wonderful individual!” **Obvious** sarcasm permeated this whole post.

The same friend who posted his profile in the first place quickly responded to my post, and was furious.

&#x200B;

I’m from an Asian country. (This might matter so I’ll preface it)

&#x200B;

I have been co-workers with this girl for 2 years. She is single. I’m engaged (I’m a boy). Over the duration, we grew closer. However, I do not see this girl for anything else other than A Friend. It is purely platonic. 

&#x200B;

For me, I’m extremely extrovert and enjoys talking. It usual for me to have friends of the opposite gender (girls). Sometimes, I hang out with a Friend of an opposite gender to catch up. My fiancée is aware of this. She’s supportive and understands that it is good to have social circle beyond the relationship. 

&#x200B;

Recently, a fellow co-worker (boy), also single, has taken a fancy for her. I know this boy as well. This is great news because love can blossom between them and the other co-workers in the office are secretly rooting for them. 

&#x200B;

The boy, however, is quite jealous of the closeness between the girl and I. (This is let known to me by another female co-worker who asked him directly) 

&#x200B;

I genuinely treat the friendship between the girl and I platonically. There is no funny stuff going on. A few close friends of mine have mentioned that she might have positive feelings for me (because she bought t-shirts for me, while she didn’t get for others). While I appreciate the gesture, I really do not feel anything for her beyond a Friend.

The phone interview went well, but I only got accepted to the next part of the process because of his referral, an in person interview, meaning there are probably applicants with prior experience in the field.  I'm very, reasonably, nervous for this and he has been giving me tips and information on everything that happened when he interviewed there.

&#x200B;

Now, this guy is my best friend and I know he would never intentionally screw me over. We've been friends for years, and he knows how badly I need this job.

&#x200B;

The other day he said his friend just got done interviewing there and he would send me the info from that interview. The next exchange went like this. I'll call him Rob. 

Me: Interviewed for my position?

Rob: Yes, yes. 

Me: Damn. 

Me: What friend?

Rob: Someone from (prior workplace, meaning prior experience in field). She's the only (PW) person I've pushed through this round because she got back to me before you did. 

&#x200B;

This can't be true, He told me about the job on a Friday night, and I gave him my resume Sunday. This means he told this other person about the job either before me, which sucks, as we've been friends for like 7 years and this person a year at best, and only through work, or AFTER he told me which REALLY sucks cause then I feel like he really doesn't give a shit at all.  

IDK. I've been asking about having a job at his place for a few months and he's always responded really positively. We've been working together on it for a while. For him to give other people a chance at the job I know isn't inherently wrong, but I feel I've been sabotaged, and by my best friend too.

I love him a lot, he's my father, but I'm so confused and tired of the mess that my life has been turned to, that I don't think I can talk to him anymore. It came to a point that I don't think it even matters anymore.

I have a horrible relationship with my mother, and now it's just the two of us in the house. I agree that they no longer had a good relationship, and as my mother said, ""he was a better father to me than a husband for her"". He was the one that took care of me whenever I got sick, that could feel if there was something weird with me. He always treated me well, even when I didn't deserved it. 

My feelings are all messy. I love him like a father, but I'm not good at handling my own feelings at all, and I didn't think we would keep in contact. I couldn't even see him go, everything lately hurts me a lot.

No one in my family really wants to listen to me because they're on my mother's side. I have always been tough and resisted every weird and hurtful situation my mother has ever brought me into, but this time, I can't handle it at all.

He messaged me and I just can't aswer him. My sisters think that I definitely should, but I just can't. My grandmother said that I'm being very unconsiderate and selfish by letting him hanging like that, but it hurts to know that when I get home, he'll not be there to make an unfunny joke.

I think that guy is still your father.  he selflessly cared for you for 15 years.  and I think it's unhealthy to cut yourself off from that, especially when your relationship with your mother is dysfunctional.

I would probably say something like ""i'm so confused right now.  sorry for not answering sooner.  i didn't know what to do"".

I put alot of research into what would be a really good brand and a really good set considering he does alot of online gaming and he had told me that his previous set had broken.

I struggle alot with money so buying this gift for him really put me in a tight spot but he's one of those people that are EXTREMELY hard to shop for because he doesn't have much interest in anything so i thought this would be an amazing gift.

Its something he actually needed and its something he can use on a regular basis and it something i put alot of thought and care into buying and i expected him to be genuinely happy about receiving.

So imagine my shock and disappointment when he opens the gift and his only reaction is ""meh"" and he tosses the gift aside like its nothing. Not even a ""thanks babe."" Just seriously nothing at all. He's kept the gift set aside completely unopened, unused, and collecting dust.

So i returned them for a full refund and now hes pissed. He said he was keeping them as a back up set for when his current set are no longer usable. 

So AITA for returning his gift to the store and getting the money back?

3514,"AITA For not driving a drunk “friend” home? Here is a bit of a backstory 
I wouldn’t call this person my friend, but we know each other because of mutual friends. She (I’ll call her B) tries to one up the person in any subject. For example B says she has a high tolerance when it comes to alcohol. My boyfriend decided to put it to the test the next time we all hang out. They agreed and that’s where the story begins.

B, my boyfriend and I were invited to a birthday party for a friend. Since I knew B and my boyfriend would be drinking I decided that I’ll be the sober one and drive them both to the party. I knew B and the birthday friend were friends so I thought B lived close. Nope, B lived 20 miles south from the birthday friend. 

We all were have fun eating food, cake and snacks while playing a few board games. A pretty laid back party, until the alcohol came to play. My boyfriend thought it would be fun to take shots of 190 proof Everclear. This stuff is so strong it could be used as fuel for your car. Of course B and my boyfriend take a shot, and chase it down with dark rum. This was after they both had a few glasses of wine. B was not feeling good at this point, and she became pretty drunk. So drunk that she was starting to get irritating. B was talking a bit too loud for my taste and she even tried to talk us into buy stuff from her MLM. 

At around 2am I decided I was getting pretty tired (I had to work at 8:00am anyway) and wanted to leave. I just didn’t want to bring B home. I knew it would take 30 minutes to bring her home. Probably drag her up to her apartment building, and then drive another 30 just so I can go to bed. I was so tired as it is, I was not up for the task. Plus my boyfriend’s place was only 10 minutes away. At this point B was also passed out on the couch. We decided to wake her and told her we would be leaving without her and then left for the night.

My boyfriend (20M) is currently on parole after serving time for a minor legal issue. Neither of us make much money; he works at an animal shelter and I’m a gas station clerk. I’m about 14 weeks. 

Anyway, about three months ago, my boyfriend broke into my dad’s truck. He had been drinking, and I’m not sure about the why behind it. The windshield was cracked and he threw up on the upholstery. My dad was pretty pissed and he wanted to press charges, but I convinced him not to. The charges would have meant my boyfriend would go back to jail.

Which brings us to now. My boyfriend and I had a verbal agreement that I would have an abortion if I ever got pregnant. I can’t use hormonal birth control, so we were doing condoms, but that failed. Now that I’m actually pregnant, I want to keep the baby and try to be a family. Every time I think of getting rid of it, I just feel broken inside. 

My boyfriend didn’t like that, and he threatened to leave me to raise our baby alone. I brought up the truck thing, and I told him that my dad and I would go to the police if he tried to duck his responsibilities.

My sister and I were both adopted internationally by American parents. We were both under a year old when we came to the US and have lived there ever since.

I haven’t driven in her car in a long time because she has had it parked in the same spot forever and only moves it for street cleaning usually which is once a month.

Well, I’m a bartender and I get home pretty late. Wednesday night I came home around 3am and saw there was street cleaning starting at 9am and my roommate’s car was on the street cleaning side.

Moving it was terrifying (it shakes and the brakes are non existent basically) but I eventually found a spot about a block away across from a park. There were no temporary street cleaning signs posted for Thursday or Friday, just a permanent sign that said something about April - Nov there’s street cleaning once a month but I really didn’t read it properly and figured she was coming home Monday.

It was NOT cheap, but I was doing pretty well for my first year living on my own and wanted to treat myself. I ordered blackberry jam! I had tried local brands, but they weren’t as good!

A few months later, I’m living with 2 new roommates. We agree to share condiments (who wants three bottles of ketchup cluttering they kitchen?).

Then the group I was working with moved out of state and got rid of my job, so I started rationing until I found a new one. This meant only partaking in my specialty jam when I was feeling really homesick because I didn’t know when I’d be able to get more.

Great news! I found a part-time job quickly and just got a full-time job on top of that! So I go to the fridge to get my jam because the rationing was over I wanted to celebrate. Only....it wasn’t there. I saw other jellies and jams you can easily buy at Walmart, but not my at-least-2x-the-price-for-about-2/3-the-quantity blackberry jam.

Me: Does anyone know what happened to my Specialty blackberry jam?

Roommate 1: It’s not in the fridge?

Me: Not the Specialty brand (My friend bought me a different brand to try and help me find something local that I liked just as much that was larger and cheaper). It looks like the elderberry jar.

Roommate 1: Had to go look to see what you were talking about but no I haven't touched it and this my first time seeing that larger jar in there

Me: Ok. It’s just that the last time I used my Specialty blackberry jam, it was around half full, so I am very perplexed.

Roommate 2: I haven’t used jam/jelly in a really long time, so I’m also no help to this situation.

Me: Ok, just in the future, please don’t use something if you didn’t buy it, especially without asking.
If I had known that it was gone, I would have made a note to order more or asked my parents to bring some down with them for me to bring back.

Roommate 2: Sure. I believe at the beginning of the year we all agreed to share condiments so if something falls into that category and we don’t want it used, we should probably explicitly state it to the group. That being said, Roommate 1 and I both stated that we don’t really even know what you’re referring to and most certainly didn’t take it, so maybe just retrace your steps.

Me: Fine. Then I would like to request that we don’t use jams and jellies without asking first. It was expensive and I was trying to save it since I didn’t know when I’d be able to splurge on myself like that again.

Context: My brother and his wife got married when I was in college about a few years ago. She got a degree in teaching, he had to go back to school to become an civil servant. They soon had a kid and then another and that's when the stress started to happen.

His wife has always been....the super fake valley girl type to me and the rest of the family.

Only civil when my parents were taking care of beach vacations or holidays. 

Regardless, when their combined debt came up and it was too expensive to daycare their kids, she quit working and my brother started working 3 jobs. Too tired and stressed out to meet 'her needs'. She kicked him out of the home, went into the separation phase and has refused to put any effort into the relationship since.

So this came up with a coworker last night. I’ll call him Alan. Alan and another coworker were talking by the bar. I thought they were talking about a movie that recently came out and I casually asked what they were talking about. 

Alan got annoyed. He told me that I needed to mind my own business and that he was tired of me inserting myself into his conversations. Clearly they were talking privately and I was rude for joining in. According to him they could have been talking about anything, possibly sensitive material, and I had no right to ask about it. 

This caught me really off guard and explained that I was just curious, it wasn’t like I interrupted them mid sentence. I just wanted to know what they thought about the film. I wasn’t trying to find out any gossip. Besides if you’re going to have a private conversation about something sensitive the bar is a really weird place to do it. 

Now, I don’t think I did anything wrong. People join other people’s conversations all the time. If I just jumped in and started making assumptions about the situation and telling them how wrong they were then yeah, definitely. But all I did was ask what they were talking about. That’s it. That’s all I’ve ever done. No ones ever gotten upset about it. I didn’t pester him. I asked once and then backed off. If it’s a sensitive thing okay thats cool you don’t have to tell me anything. But I don’t think it’s necessarily rude of me to ask to join a conversation. 

Alan obviously didn’t agree. He insisted that I was being rude and he got pretty excited. And eventually stormed off when I told him he was overreacting.  Later on he came up to me and apologized for getting upset and told me he hoped I understood now. Then walk off again when I told him I still don’t think I did anything wrong. 

But maybe I’m wrong and I’m just not seeing his side of it. So AITA?

3534,"AITA for ghosting my ex but receiving and keeping his gifts? My ex and I broke up last summer because he was an exchange student and he moved back to his home country. It was a very hard breakup for me and I really don’t want to have anything to do with him because it’s clear that our futures lie on different continents. I am a very emotional person, and all I want to do is facetime him or visit him, but I have great self control so I don’t ever do that since it’s unproductive for me to keep in touch with him knowing that I can find better people in my own country. (Statistically speaking) However, ever since the new year he’s been sending me gifts every 2 weeks. The gifts range from $50-$300 and being the poor college student I am, I just kept them and I haven’t really reached out to him or thanked him or spoken to him.  The main reason why I don’t is because the thought of him gives me bad energy and even nightmares at times because as great as our relationship was, the aftermath of getting over him was tumultuous to say the least. Am I the asshole for not at least sending him a text?

&#x200B;

Edit 

\- A lot of you are quoting my ""bad energy"" statement so let me explain. (I didn't want to bore you with my detailed thoughts, but it seems to matter) I have already closed that chapter in my life, we both did. When we broke up, it was 100% clear that we weren't going to stay in contact because I told him that I needed this closure. He knows how resilient I am; that's why he's choosing to send me gifts instead of calling or texting. To be completely transparent, it was more-so his choice to move back to his home country because he graduated and had the freedom to work anywhere whereas I still have 2 more years in law school. Also, his parents are single digit millionaires, while I am far from it, and they actually told him that he should stay in the States with me because they have connections here. So even though, with my pride and ego, I played it off as if it was an equal break up, he left a scar. And trust me, I know that I'm being incredibly immature by not sending him a simple text saying ""stop, please,"" but it's because I don't want to open the floodgates (even a tiny bit) after spending so many months torturing myself, preventing myself from doing so. So I meant ""bad energy"" as in if I start making contact with him, he's going to send me paragraphs upon paragraphs (knowing him) of why we should be together and how I should move to where he is because he has the means to take care of me blah blah blah, and I don't want to be tempted. I know I'm going to instantly fall back to the 24/7 cycle of thinking about him, re-evaluating my future, dreaming about him etc. = BAD ENERGY.

\- The gifts don't give me bad energy because it's not him that I hate, I hate myself for being so obsessed with him. They're just affirmation that he's missing me. And honestly his gifts don't tempt me into getting back together with him = NO BAD ENERGY. I eat that chocolate thinking ""that's some good ass chocolate"" not ""damn this chocolate is good, he gave me this chocolate."" Also he and his family have old money so I feel less guilty. ","YTA, the thought of him gives you bad energy, but I guess his gifts don't.

3536,"AITA for thinking my coworker should have waited to announce her pregnancy? My coworker, Hayley, and her husband (both early to mid-twenties) announced her second pregnancy to the office a few weeks ago. Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We’re a relatively close-knit group since there aren’t that many of us.

We were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).

Earlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.

I immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). 

But during this whole thing, I couldn’t help but wonder why she and her husband didn’t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.

Obviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I’m being too judgmental.

Please tell me - AITA?
","YTA.

Here's the thing, miscarriages will always hurt the expectant parents.  Even though they are surprisingly common they are still going to hurt.  Even if they don't announce it and act like they won't get excited until week 12, they are still going to be hurt from day 1.

So what you're saying is ""my coworker went through a traumatic experience and told me.  AITA for wishing she didn't tell me about it?"". And yeah, that's kind of an asshole stand to take.  It sounds like she really appreciated your support through this so she's better off for having shared this.  And if you actually hadn't cared and hadn't said anything that would be fine too.  But your coworker is in pain an you care enough to be sad too.  Its unreasonable to put this on her not to have caused you that sadness, you know?

And I get the social norm is to wait until the second trimester.  But all that does is hide and put even more of a stigma (or at least taboo) on miscarriages.  And as you said, miscarriages are really common.  And normalizing them and discussing them just might help people to deal with them.",1,YTA,0.0,0.0,0
3541,"AITA for not wanting to be in my sons life. My son is currently 2 but the story starts 4 years ago when I dropped out of college and moved back in with my mom and stepfather. When I first moved back in was looking at a mountain of debt from my credit card and student loans and I was unemployed. To make matters worse I had been arrested earlier that same month and I was in the process of hiring a lawyer to help get the charges expunged.

Throughout college I continuously abused alcohol and that abuse only got worse. I routinely drank throughout the day and began to experiment with recreational drugs. I managed to get a shitty job making 7.25 an hour at a movie theatre where I met the future mother of my kid, we’ll call her Jill.

Jill was fun and she and entered a casual sexual relationship. She was in her late 20s (I was in my early 20s) and also lived with her parents. We’d get drunk and fuck after work and maybe hangout here and there but it was nothing serious. 8 months into the relationship she told that she was pregnant.

Now I want to make this very clear. The moment she told that she was pregnant I told her that it was her body and that it was her choice but if she kept the baby I’d have nothing to do with either of them. Throughout the pregnancy I tried to come around to the idea of co-parenting but I just couldn’t get my head around it. She told me that if I didn’t want to be apart of his life that that would be fine and she wouldn’t come after me for child support but that I shouldn’t expect any favors in terms of visitation or custody agreements should I change my mind down the road.

I had always been on the fence about marriage and kids but I knew 100% that I didn’t want any of that with her. I was a college dropout making minimum with a criminal record. I was also going to court mandated therapy to deal with my alcoholism .I wasn’t in a position to support myself let alone another human being.

Fast forward to the present day and the situation hasn’t gotten any better. My mom (who is active in my sons life and in the moms) kicked me out of the house. I got sober for a few months but when I relapsed my mom had had enough. He’s 2 now and I haven’t been to either of his birthdays and I’ve only seen him may 4-5 times. Her family hates me and wants nothing to do with while members of my own family have distanced themselves from. On my last birthday all I got was a text from my mom.

I currently live with my grandmother in a rural town several hours away from my son and his mom. We’ve blocked each other on all social media and she has my number blocked. We haven’t spoken in over a year. I’ve got a decent paying job and I’ve been able to pay off my credit cards.

The parents were very hurt she didn’t tell them sooner and very concerned that she hasn’t been to a doctor or done any kind of planning for a baby. 

I’ve never spoken to the baby’s daddy (seen him around bfs parents’ house a few times). I’ve tried to make conversation around the holidays but neither of them want to participate in anything.

3550,"WIBTA for yelling at neighbors who walk their dogs? My husband always tells me it’s not a big deal, but it drives me ABSOLUTELY crazy. 

We live in a neighborhood equipped with walking paths. Our house in particular is on a funky corner where we have the biggest backyard and there are no neighbors behind us. Instead, about 20 feet behind our cinder block wall, is a walking path. 

I have 3 small lapdogs, 2 of which are barkers. When people walk on the path, the boy barks, the girl follows, it last 10 seconds and that’s it. No big deal, life with small dogs as it is. 

Where I have a problem is we have a few select neighbors that walk their big dogs OFF the path. They bring their dogs right up to our property line, in doing so they have to tuck behind numerous bushes that are between my wall and the path. Now, poor design by the HOA, but our back fence is about 2 feet shorter than any of our other block walls. The top 2 feet are an iron see through. 

These people who walk their dogs off the path are allowing their dogs to put their paws up on my fence and are essentially freaking my dogs out. They let their big dog look at, bark at, and otherwise nuisance my dogs through this little look thru portion of the fence. Every time it makes me so mad like get your freaking dog back on the path - it’s clearly upsetting my dogs who are doing their due diligence of protecting the yard from intruders.

3551,"AITA for being annoyed and passive-aggressive about street parking? WIBTA for saying something? **Background:** I live in a residential neighborhood with narrow, long lots. The houses on my street were built between 1910 and 1940, and they back onto an alleyway where there are typically garages if not rental/granny flats. Very few houses have driveways in front of their house.

**Situation:** We've lived here for a year, and typically my husband parks in our garage and I park directly in front of our house, since it's closer to an entrance and I have a three-year-old that I have to load in and out. There's room for just about two cars in front of each lot, and I like to leave the other spot open for visitors or my parents. I do not mind at all if neighbors have friends or family members over for half-day or so and take up the spot.

Recently, my neighbor moved in another renter to her single-family home, and now rather than having two cars on the street, they have three or four. The owner of the house has demolished the garage/carport space in the back alley in favor of a pool and a shed or a granny flat. The new tenant has taken to parking directly in front of my house, even when there are parking spaces available closer to her lot. The new tenant has never introduced herself, and the owner has never come over to explain that she has a new tenant so that parking might be a bit tighter. Trash days are the worst days, as they not only park in front of our house, but put their trash bins in front of our house too. On days when it's particularly ridiculous, I'll watch from my front window as they park.

Today, it kind of came to a head. I arrived home on a rainy afternoon with a toddler with a stomachache and the owner of the house is parked directly in front of my front door, with one free spot behind it (between me and my other neighbor's house) two, maybe three free spots (in front of her house) in front of where she's parked. Exasperated, I went to park in one of those spots, when she rushed out and moved the car. I said, ""Thank you,"" but avoided further conversation. Instead of backing all the way up so I'd be straddling my lot and other neighbor's lot, I parked right where she had been (directly in front of my front door) to sort of mark my territory.

Since then, she's had three other cars (two tenants and one visitor) park. The visitor and one of the tenants parked in the two spots straddling the three different lots - other neighbor/us and us/neighhbor-in-question. As I watched the tenant park, I noticed her back into my car. My husband went out to talk to her and she denied it but said to, ""Come see if her if I notice anything.""

AITA for being so annoyed about this? Am I being ""that crazy neighbor"" or am I being reasonable here?

**Edited to add:** I would agree that street parking does not entitle you to park in front of your house. I guess what I'm particularly annoyed with in this situation is that they've eliminated their non-street parking by getting rid of their garage/alley carport and then taken up the street parking in front of their neighbors' homes and have a higher-than-average number of cars.

She had a kid with a guy by accident, decided to keep it but didn’t want the guy to have full custody cause he already had a kid he didn’t take care of. She was living with family who abused her physically and emotionally. I tried to help her out, after a couple weeks she was living with me and I got her a server job at the restaurant I worked.
   
    I was having some family issues of my own at the time, so after her living with me for a few weeks, we got a notice of eviction and had a little over a month to vacate. She wanted to keep living with me. We ended up finding a nice 2br basement apartment to rent close to the job and a family member gave me an old car to use until I got back on my feet.

    About 2 weeks before moving, she starts hanging out with this guy in question, we’ll call him James. Girl starts acting differently, so I suspected she could be relapsing on dope. She used before her kid but stayed clean through and after pregnancy, so I asked her if she was using and she denied it.

    3 days before the big day of moving out and everything, she wanted to hang out with James at 1am, I told her be safe and be at work on time. I go to sleep, go to work like normal, but halfway through the day found out she od’d outside of a gas station on a bench while James was inside talking to the gas attendants for half an hour.

3568,"AITA for tipping less due the way the waitress was dressed? Hey everyone,

So when I normally dine out, I tip 15% of the pre-tax bill, as is the standard in Ontario. (For context, our prices don't include tax, minimum wage is $14 / hour (even for tipped employees), and tax is 13%). I've never been in a situation where I tipped someone less, and have tipped up to 20% at times.

Today however, I decided to only tip 12%. This was because how the waitress was dressed. Now it wasn't a fancy restaurant or anything, but I felt the waitress was dressed inappropriately for a casual family restaurant. She was wearing a company T-shirt along with a leggings-sweatpants hybrid. They were grey and kind of looked like sweatpants, but were really tight (clearly showed the outline of her behind, including the crack) (more revealing than your typical yoga pants). Since I felt she was dressed inappropriately, I reduced her tip to 12%.

Not sure if it is relevant, but she was actually on the same bus as I was on my way to the restaurant, where she was wearing the same pants and a crop top. So she was able to go to the back and change her shirt into a company shirt, but didn't change her pants.

&#x200B;

AITA for reducing her tip?

&#x200B;

Edit: Is actually too much to ask in the modern era to expect waiters to wear a proper pair of pants? Sweatpants and leggings are both inappropriate on their own I feel for anykind of job, or even out an about outside of a gym.

Edit 2: Tipping is for service, and part of the service is to expect someone to dress appropriately for their job.

Edit 3: Would your judgement stay the same if someone reduce the tip for a man wearing sweatpants?

Edit 4: Because people are commenting on my age, I am 23.",YTA- it had nothing to do with her service and was obviously up to the establishments dress code. Just because you didn't find it aesthetically pleasing doesn't mean you should reduce someone's pay.,1,YTA,1.0,1.0,0
3569,"AITA for gaving up on my severely depressed brother? Hello, I'm 17 and bro 25. He is depressed for 3 years now browsing 4chan, Reddit and playing video games 24/7. It all happened because his girlfriend left him for another guy. I don't know the whole story but basically they have different laws in Dubai and it's the parents  who chooses who will their daughter marry (I have no idea if this is correct). They chose some other guy over my brother and despite my bro and gf loving each other (or so I've heard) she married someone else. Now she just eats fast food all the time, has totally 0 friends, goes out of house only ocassionally when my dad shouts at him to get the rubbish out or to go shopping, he also goes to psychologist for 2 years now, which I think is bad because my bro says  pessimistic stuff like ""nothing will change anyway"" so no cognitive behavioral therapy which I read about in self help books which helped me.  I just don't want this negativity and we have nothing to talk about (he only talks about videogames) and I'm trying to stay away from them because they waste a lot of my time and I can't get things done.

I'm 26F and currently living with my mom for a month between apartments. Normally we get along fine and she was super excited to have me stay here during the holidays. However, she's extremely uptight whereas I'm super easy going. But it has been fine so far.

We've been talking about getting a Christmas tree today some time after my lunch plans, but never chose a time. I went to lunch then got home and she was at the grocery store. I had a headache, so I went to lie down. When my mom got home she immediately said ""let's go get a christmas tree"" and I told her I was lying down. Immediately, she got upset, yelled FINE, I'LL JUST DO IT MYSELF, and left to go get a tree alone--which is something that I consider to be a special thing you do with family.

3574,"WIBTA if I cancel my health insurance and thus my kids' (17,18) coverage? (edit: not retired, no Tricare)

I pay child support  for my 2 kids who I will call N and G, and have been since divorce - over 10 years ago. I was in the military up until 3 years ago; so for those unfamiliar, I and my kids were fully covered at no cost to me. Therefore it made sense at the time of the divorce that I was responsible for insurance. That changed when I left the military and suffice to say I fell upon hard times. So up until last year I had no reasonable means to do so and that fell upon the ex and her husband.

As a disabled veteran, I am covered for healthcare, so I enrolled in my current insurance plan only so the kids could be covered (out of guilt, and pressure from the ex). Now, a couple things. I'm almost positive that the very significant amount I pay each month, is paying her rent. She definitely (IMHO) has been taking advantage. The 18 (almost 19) year old works full time, taking classes at their local Community college. The youngest is still in HS, and works part time on weekends. Their mother makes them pay their own car insurance and gas.

Why I say she's been taking advantage: As mentioned, she's remarried. She's not working (as of the last time we spoke 6 months ago; no idea if this has changed or not). They moved from MO to CO a few years back, but MO remained in charge of the child support. When N turned 18, I called that agency to ask about the changes and was assured it was reflected in their system. Yet, come the next pay period they continued taking the same amount. Called to ask about that and was told the order would have to be changed. How do I do that? It would have to be done in the state where they are living.

She's also loving tax time, between my kids and their kid.  I looked over the decree and it doesn't mention anything about taxes. I asked her about letting me have a turn or two to claim them, especially since she's been taking all the benefit all these years. She basically blew it off, using as ammunition the fact that I was involuntary unemployed for about 3 months and, for another few months after that, wasn't making near enough to be able to pay anything. So there is that... oh by the way MO went ahead and confiscated my IRA. So thank goodness for that (/s) because I am no longer behind or owe back support. Oh, and I also recently filed bankruptcy this year and recently that was discharged.

Honestly I was going to try to just grin and bear it one more year but let's just say all the above has been pointed out to me and is kind of eating me up. But with this BS system, dunno if I can trust it to stop when it should.

TL;DR supported my kids all their lives, lately have barely been able to feed myself after CS, went into bankruptcy. Youngest will be 18 soon, other one is basically self sufficient, unlikely that my child support is fully/directly supporting them; thinking any costs can be covered by the 875 per month that should be lower.","YWBTA. First of all, if your ex is using the money to pay her rent, that is providing your kids with a place to live and is a completely appropriate way of spending the money. If you feel like you’re paying too much in support, go back to court, but don’t screw your kids over and cancel their health insurance. That’s seriously shitty.",1,YTA,0.0,0.0,0

Purple has a husband + 3 children (5, 4 and 2) and live in a 2 bedroom apartment. It's a tight fight.

Green is single and has 2 dogs and wants to move into a bigger place.

Somewhere along the road the 2 started talking about buying a home together. They've become serious on the idea. They think they found the right home for them and I guess Green decided it would be good to set some ground rules. She has a few other friends who do NOT like Purple in the slightest.

Purple hasn't done anything nasty or spiteful to them, she has even invited some of them out with us. But they made it clear they can't stand her personality.

So Green has made the rule whenever her friends come over to the house, Purple has to make herself scarce. She went as far as to explain to Purple why. Purple made the comment about her friends needing to grow up.

3578,"AITA for walking out on a blind date because the woman was very overweight? To make a long story short, a club at my university was doing this ""blind date"" program where you enter preferences via their website and they have a ""matchmaking team"" that finds the best potential date.

She made her disappointment known multiple times as she tried to figure out what she could do with limited ability. I apologized, several times, and agreed that it was wrong that we had talked over her. 

Then I turned to the person running the game and asked if we could spend a valuable resource to allow her to have her turn the way she wanted to take it before we rudely talked over her.

My cousin is getting married to his girlfriend, who happens to be half-Chinese. My cousin is white and British. As such, they are trying their best to incorporate both cultures into their wedding. They compromised by making the rehearsal dinner (2 days before the wedding) to be Chinese themed.

The bride’s family rented out this fancy Chinese restaurant and they had a traditional Chinese tea ceremony beforehand. The invitation only specified “cocktail formal”. But I knew that the bride and some female members of her family would be wearing cheongsams (like traditional Chinese dresses).

So I decided that it would be fun to dress up and match the Eastern theme. I wore a blue cheongsam and did my hair and makeup in a Asian manner. My older sister did the same. We showed up to the rehearsal dinner, and to our surprise none of the non-Chinese guests were wearing traditional clothes. It was a bit awkward, I could tell some people were staring at us.

Sorry if this issue is kind of stupid. Hope it's not too long.

Late last year, a friend, lets call her Anna (21), helped me (23) pay for a concert she insisted we go to. I declined several times at first, because a ticket was around $250 and I just plain didn't have the money. She kept insisting to pay for the ticket and I could pay her back whenever, and I eventually caved. At the time, I was working and lived with my parents, so I figured I could save up and pay her back; Not to mention, a relative of mine who we could stay with lived in the city the event was in. This was the only reason I agreed, because then I only had to pay food.

Fast forward, it's been a few months, and I've only paid her around $50 when she wouldn't stop asking for it when she was ""broke"".

Anna on the other hand, doesn't work or pay bills, and receives quite a bit of money every few months from her parents but is ridiculously irresponsible with it.

3596,"AITA for refusing to give my staff a holiday that they requested at the last minute? I might be the asshole here but one of my staff wanted tomorrow off. I refused because it was last minute, he asked me as he was leaving for the day. He then brought up how he hadn’t had his day off from last week.
I then told him that his day off from last week was already used up because I had sent him home for falling asleep at work around 11am. He argued that it was only half a day. Well I am not paying him for half the day which he spent sleeping.
This guy is pretty incompetent and the only reason he is still employed is because he never misses work and is regular with his days off...every Sunday.
Now if someone else had asked, I would have given them the day off, no questions asked. That’s because they are flexible when I want them to come in and also tell me well in advance if they won’t be able to come in. But this guy never makes any exceptions to his “I don’t work Sundays” rule except when he wants another day off.
A couple points to consider: his absence will have zero impact. He is merely a seat filler for when more competent salesmen go for lunch/ break.

Also bonus: should I just fire the guy? Because we are both wasting our time, he is never gonna get a raise from me and is already on his last warning for falling asleep at work and for no call no shows and for being late to come in. So he does any of those things again he will get fired anyway.","Yeah YTA.

Not trying to use that as an excuse for my behaviour, but I didn't know how bad ghosting was until I saw another post) I was dating someone for a month who hardly put any effort into the relationship. He never texted me first, even if he was online and he stood me up twice. I thought to myself why bother so I stopped dating him. I texted him that I didn't see myself being with him and had to think about it, but I didn't outright break up. If he texted me I gave monosyllabic replies, and made excuses as to why I couldn't go out. He eventually got the message and stopped trying. I feel kind of bad about it now though, and think I should have broken up with him in person instead of not talking to him. AITA?

3599,"AITA for throwing a wet paper towel ball at someone in the bathroom stall at work? I’m 25M and a hard-working employee at a well-known tech company. There is one men’s bathroom on my floor level that has only 3 toilet stalls and they fill up pretty often. Employees like to escape work and use these stalls as a getaway to play on their phones and burn the clock, and sometimes it seems like people spend 15+ minutes in the stalls to “do their business”. Also for a side note later, the bathroom stall walls don’t touch the ground completely, so you can see the shoes of red-handed people using the restroom.

Whenever I need to use the restroom, there is usually a 50% chance all the stalls will be filled up on my floor. It gets pretty frustrating and I have to resort to taking the stairs down to the bottom level to go to the bathroom (if there are stalls open hopefully).

Today I needed to go to the restroom and went to the bathroom to see no stalls available to use. I did take note of the lime green sketchers visible from the nearest stall and left to go back to work and wait. I waited maybe 15-20 minutes and returned to the bathroom to see the same lime green sketchers under the bathroom stall, did my business, washed my hands, and eyed the lime green sketchers still there plus the faint sound of button clicks coming from that stall.

As I was leaving, I wadded up a golfball-size wet paper towel and lobbed a nice hook shot into the stall. I’m pretty sure it was a headshot lol. As I was walking away and exiting the bathroom like a fade-away shooter, a shrieking “what the heck!!” followed in the distance. I don’t really feel much remorse for what I did.

My friend and I were thinking about raising our future children in our language. The mothers of the children would of course speak to the children in English, so the children would be bilingual.

(Quick side note: Artificial doesn't mean it's limited or anything, you can express anything you like in the language).

I compromised and told her I would only light it while Im awake and attending to it. She seemed fine with that.

3611,"AITA for inviting a friend to move to my city to live with me, deciding it won't work out, and asking her to move out, knowing she will probably have to leave the city? As I was about to move in to a new 2 bedroom apartment 1.5 years ago, I was in the process of rekindling a friendship that started around 10 years earlier.

This person I always knew as a badass and good person, but recently she had fallen on hard times. She seemed really depressed and her life seemed like it was crumbling around her, so I spontaneously invited her to move to my city (about 2.5 hours away) to try to rebuild. I was thinking she would get a better job and figure out how to get back on her feet.

A year and half later, and her life situation does not seem to have improved by much. She found a job she likes, but it does not pay well and it's kind of a dead end thing.

I decided that I didn't want to live with her almost immediately after she moved in. She moved in with a cat, and I didn't realize how much living with a cat would annoy me. She is kind of a slob and while she loves the cat, she does not take good care of him or his situation, so my house is covered in hair and it smells like cat. 

She does a lot to annoy me (not locking doors, not doing dishes, not refilling the toilet paper, not refilling water pitchers) and she doesn't clean common areas at all. 

On the other hand, she is a good friend, and if there was anything really important that I needed, she would be there for me (example, I left my suitcase on a bus and she tracked it down to the bus depot for me).

She couldn't pay the rent a few months in a row (I charge her $375+ utilities which is a steal) but she eventually paid me back every penny. But that experience let me know she would never be able to live in the city without me.

I am asking her to move out even though I know it means she will have to quit her job and move out of the city and start over from scratch. Should I be more sensitive in this situation?

Edit: We have spoken about the cleanliness issue. She does not notice when there is mold in the tub or the house smells like cat pee. We have different standards for cleanliness. We are both in our early 30s, so these habits of hers have been practiced for a couple of decades.

UPDATE: I caved and told her she can stay. I'll just upgrade to a better neighborhood when I pay down some of my debt in a couple of years and she can fill my room.

3613,"AITA if I want to admit my feelings to a girl with a boyfriend? Of course from just the title the obvious answer is YTA, but hear me out.

I met this girl 4 years ago, when I was 19. I was still figuring myself out, since now I'm a confirmed demisexual type of person. I was never one to be with a random girl just for the deal of it, and can hardly even perform under those circumstances.

But when I met this girl I started to feel attracted to her. Not only did we share interests, but our emotional aspect was preety much on point. During this time she was single and so was I, and we even got to cuddle once. But out of my fear, I simply didn't do anything about it and we simply drifted away. She started dating another guy and once that happened we stopped talking all together.

Last month I had been going through a self discovery journey of sorts, traveling and meeting new people and decided to contact her again. We hit it off preety well and while we chatted I did my best to see if she still was single. The whole month goes through and no mention of a boyfriend nor while texting nor in social media. I know people that don't usually publish their personal relationships on the internet but she simply did not talk about it.
When I came back from my travels (about a couple of weeks ago) , we met again and I asked her if she was seeing anyone, at which point she states that she is, and with the same guy for 2 years.

I kinda fell apart and got distressed. And these weeks have been quite rough for me emotionally, only blaming myself for simply not acting when the possibility was real.

I am planning on telling her the truth, of how I still have strong feelings for her. I am not looking for her to dump her boyfriend, nor am I looking for a petty excuse to barge into other people's life, but I just can't live with all of this anguish inside of me.

I'll take advice AND any criticism. I truly feel like an asshole doing this but many of my friends agreed that I should be honest with her. (I'm incapable of lying. Even if I try it's preety obvious I'm lying) and I know she knows I'm depressed as hell, which is horrible when she asks what's wrong and I simply pretend it's a ""random lol depression"".

3614,"AITA for not condoning money to the lady that cleans my house the day she had a miscarriage? Edit: sorry for using the word “condoning”, wrong choice, not my first language. I meant “AITA for not letting her keep the money”. 





I live with two other girls, we hired a young lady to come clean the house once a week. We actually do much of the cleaning, but she does deep cleaning so the house keeps well. We pay her enough (cash in hand), give her a Christmas bonus, a small gift for her bday, paid holidays (all of this once a year) and sometimes we share food with her or clothing we no longer use. Non of which we are legally bound to do. 

She has a hard life so she keeps asking us to pay her in advance sometimes, or straight out asking for small loans and offers to pay with work. Sometimes she owes us as much as a months worth the money and we worry that one day she might just not come back and we have no way to find her, but we do try to help her out as much as we possibly can. 

We are usually not home by the time she comes, we manage to leave her a hidden key outside so that she can come in and leave without us having to be there, we trust her and we have never had an issue with lost things or anything like that. 

So last week she came in and 10 minutes later she calls me and tells me that she’s bleeding and since she’s 8 week pregnant she rushed to the ER. I felt very sorry for her, I called later on to ask how she was doing and she said she had a miscarriage. I told her to take some days off and rest and give a call when she feels better so her job will be there when she’s ok. 

I then came home and realised that even though she didn’t do the cleaning, she took the money (we leave her pay on the dinning table every time she comes in) and didn’t mention anything about it. A couple of days later she tells me that her mom will cover for her for a few days so she sends her in yesterday. At the end of the day she asks me for the pay and I said that her daughter took the pay last week and I thought I wasn’t going to pay her this day because of that. She gives me the dirtiest look ever, said “ok then” and left. I texted the young lady and said “I’m sorry, I didn’t think I was supposed to pay her since you came in last week and didn’t do the work but took the money” so she said she would figure out a way to pay her herself since she forgot that she took the money. 

I’m not sure she forgot about it, I guess she thought we wouldn’t mind letting her keep the money, but just because we are generous with her it doesn’t mean we don’t work hard for our money so we are not going to give it away, specially since she didn’t mention anything about it. 

Now I’m second guessing if we should have let her keep the money since she had a miscarriage, she made me feel bad about it anyway some how.

I didn’t forget about A, and still focused on her most of the night. However, as the dance was winding down, I decided to ask B if she would like to come home with me afterwards. Because I drove A, I asked some of my mutual friends if she could just hang out with them afterwards. B and I really hit it off and we are now dating.

One friend said that even if we didn’t have concrete plans afterwards, it is bad form to a) not at least drive her home/ her next destination and b) go home with another girl afterwards.

So actually this is a really long story but I'll try to make it actually short. I graduated from high school in May and my parents actually made me get a job when the had actually originally agreed I could chill this summer. 

My dad got me a job working for a contractor doing a job actually getting ready for the SW gas to come in and install a new pipeline. it fucking sucks ass so hard because I'm out in the heat all day, I get hazed all fucking day long, it's like exhausting and it's also killed my energy so I'm getting less healthy by not hitting the gym anymore.  We actually have to be to the shop at 5:15 AM and I'm still actually tired as fuck so I kept screwing up the load out. The owner of the company actually pulled me aside last Monday and cursed at me said ""you fuck everything up, I don't want you to do anything else besides fill up the Igloos (those are water jugs we take out with us to the jobsite). Do you understand me?""  I was actually like whatever man but for the last 3 days I did it perfectly. 

Well this morning I got there and this fucking total asshole Nacho (his actual real name is Ignacio) came and grabbed me and told me he needed my help loading the cement. I told him the boss told me to actually do nothing besides fill the Igloos. Nacho called me ""culo"" (it means ass in Spanish but it also kind of implies pussy as in weak) and actually implied I was a weak ass who couldn't lift and said he'd push me in the trench today if I didn't get off my ass. So I was actually pretty afraid and I helped him. But I completely forgot the igloos because of it. 

Actually when we got to the jobsite the boss realized I'd forgotten the water and screamed his head off at me. Like screamed his head off in front of everyone (which is actually hilarious because I read a lifeprotip yesterday to praise in public, punish in private. I guess he actually runs a shit business and doesn't get it). So he's fuming mad that we had to have water delivered and it cost him precious pennies to get it done. I'm eating my lunch alone now and actually being shunned by everyone else. 

Was I the asshole for this or did I just make a mistake?

edit: some confusing words.","YTA- you had me at “My parents made me get a job when they originally agreed I could chill this summer”. If you’re not in school (and hell for I’m assuming most of us even if you are in school) work is going to be a near lifetime responsibility. The fact that your dad A) found you a job, and B) found one for you in a high pay starting position (any construction job I worked paid waaaay better than minimum wage) was a favor for you. 

Then you got to the point of you being less healthy because you’re not getting to the gym. Unless you’re trying for a specific sport/ activity where muscle twitch and certain balance maneuvers are needed working construction can be about as good as you can ask for workout wise. Try and think of everyday as a work out and if you can prove yourself useful you’ll probably stop getting teased by your fellow crew members. The reason they are picking on you (outside of the fact that you sound like a complaining little bitch) is that they usually get paid better by the work they do and having you around slowing things down and pouting about it being early is hurting their bottom line.  Even if they don’t get paid by the tonnage of work, watching someone else slouch while you bust your ass will piss anyone off. I have a hard time thinking you’d be relegated to water duty if you had shown enthusiasm to learn. 

A lot of people work construction when they’re young,  some make a living off of it and some use it as motivation to make sure they stay in school and get the education they need.

3625,"AITA For not telling my friend his GF cheated on him TLDR: My friends GF kissed our other mate at a bar, and my friends think I suck for not telling him. 

So I've been working at this bar for a year now and it's a real fun time, we all get on great and go out on the regular.

One of the my best friends there is this guy we'll pretend is called Frank. Now Frank is the loveliest guy you'll meet, he's a team leader but somehow he gets things done without ever getting annoyed or stressed.

Anyway, another girl started at the same time as me, who we'll call Amy, we have one of those really rare platonic relationships between a guy and a girl that feels real special.

So naturally I was over the moon when those two got together, he's 23 and has never had a GF before, just because he's kinda shy. I'd honestly say she's kinda out of his league but it never seemed a problem for either of them. He kinda hit the jackpot with this girl and you can tell he knows it. I didn't know him before but he genuinely seems so happy with her and clearly loves her. 

However on one of our nights out, a few months back, Amy and our other work friend (Let's call him... Felix) went out for a smoke and were both quite drunk. None of us thought anything of it but I remember thinking she seemed kinda quiet and left not long after. 

The next day at work she had to go home early because she literally couldn't stop crying and wouldn't say why. 

I was kind of intrigued but didn't pry, but last week Felix left for Uni and me and him went for a farewell drink, and he confessed to me that him and Amy made out that night and it all made sense. 

Now I told him that in my opinion I thought telling Frank was the right thing to do, but that was for him and Amy to decide and I wasn't going to speak for them. If I was him, I would ask Amy to tell Frank, but if she didn't I would because he's my friend. But I'm not him, and I can see why he wouldn't tell him. 

This is something I stood by, even when my friends from outside work told me I had an obligation to tell Frank about what they did. 

This didn't phase me, like she clearly feels bad and I genuinely think she wouldn't do it again. She just treated him to a week in London complete with musicals and boat rides. Stuff like that isn't cheap bearing in mind she works in a bar so isn't exactly the richest. You don't do that for someone you care so little about to cheat on continuously. Plus life's too short to ruin someone's happiness over a single mistake. 

The only cause for doubt is that now they're talking about moving in together and it's all seeming like a lot more of a serious relationship. I dunno, I just wanna know if you all think Frank has a right to know regardless of where it comes from, or if I should stay out of it.","I'm honestly *really* on the fence with this one. I don't necessarily think you'd be TA for not telling your friend, because personally I've always preferred to stay out of other people's business and not cause any unnecessary drama. At the same time though, if I were in this guy's position I'd definitely want my friends to tell me if they knew my SO had cheated on me in any capacity.

I dont know how close you are to this girl but, maybe try to talk to ""Amy"" first and possibly convince her to tell ""Frank"" herself? She obviously feels a lot of guilt and personally, I think this will only cause problems in the future. Tell her that being honest is one of the most important elements in a healthy relationship and that its better to be open and honest with Frank now (and possibly resolve the issue/get past it) than if he somehow finds out about this down the road and realizes that she hid it from him.

Edit: just realized you said this happened a few months ago. well its probably too late to do anything about it now haha. but anyway my point stands- I think it probably would have been better if you spoke to either amy or frank about it, but I cant really bring myself to say that youre an asshole in this situation.",1,YTA,0.0,1.0,1

3627,"WIBTA if I reported a convo to my store manager? Hi. Workplace confrontation, unsure if I should go to my SM or not. 

I’m a (29F) Key Holder (lower management), & have been in this role for 4 years. My co-worker (29M) has been with the company for just under 2 years & was recently promoted to ASM. Let’s call him Jake.

On Wednesday, I was managing our sales floor & removed a rolling rack from our fitting room section (previously used for go-backs) & re-training the team to do go-backs quicker. Team & I landed on this to help get product back onto the floor quicker, & more luxury for our guests. 
Around 2:30, we got a rush & our fit room tables were being overrun by go-backs. Jake wanted the RR back up. I asked if we could utilize the space under the tables (as thats what they are used for), & he started questioning me about what looks better (a full table of go-backs vs a clean table & a full rolling rack). We went back & forth for a bit until he said, “Well, you’re wrong.”
I said ‘Ok’ & walked away & continued leading.

After my shift, I asked if we could chat. We sat outside the store, & I what he said was mean, not really feedback. & didn’t support my floor. He then went on to tell me about all the examples in the last year of how I am ‘impossible to give feedback to’, how I take every thing from him as ‘a personal attack’, & how he ‘couldn’t believe we were having this conversation over a rolling rack’. I expressed that this wasn’t what the conversation was about, that his tone & the words he used were hurtful & not helpful. 
He then let me know that after my ASM interview (which I didn’t get), he ‘told my SM that I shouldn’t get the position because of the issue mentioned above’. 
At this point, I started to cry (I try to be non-confrontational as it flairs my anxiety) - I apologized that I was crying & that I was upset, that if he really felt that way in before he should have told me in the moment & not in this convo, & just requested that he be aware of how he talks to people & the words he uses (in return, I made the commitment to be more self-aware on how I receive feedback from him). He followed it up with ‘he’s not going to change the way he gives feedback just because I don’t like it’, & that he’s not going to say ‘oh iamthelawson I don’t want to hurt your feelings but....”.

3633,"WIBTA if I drank while out to dinner with my parents when my father is an ex-alcoholic? Hi all! 

I'm recently 21 and I'm not sure how to navigate drinking when around my parents. My father has struggled with alcohol addiction his entire life, although his last relapse (to my knowledge) was 5 years ago, which I believe may be the longest he's gone dry for.

I already follow the unspoken rule about never bringing alcohol into the house, I would never do that. However, I don't go out to eat often and when I do I'm now curious about trying small portions of different types of alcohol. For example, we're going to a ramen restaurant and I've always wanted to try sake.

I don't want to be TA to my dad, though. 

Drinking isn't something I can talk with about my parents, my mother does occasionally drink when away from my dad but never with him. She emphatically refused to get my first drink with me on my birthday, which I found a bit disappointing because that was something I wanted to do with her, as a rite of passage almost. I'm not talking about a bar or anything, just a small glass of wine with dinner. Anyways, that's off topic a bit. So, Reddit, I ask you. 

WIBTA for ordering a drink while out with my parents?

EDIT: I know not a lot of people have replied compared to a lot of threads but those who have have confirmed what I thought: I WBTA if I did this. I don't want to trigger my dad, I've experienced addiction too (not to alcohol or drugs) and it sucks. I don't need to be impatient, which is all this is, I have the rest of my life to drink away from my parents.

Thank you guys for the input, I really appreciate it. And thank you for the concern about my own weakness to alcoholism. I'm very, very careful around alcohol and will continue to be so for the rest of my life.","YWBTA.

3634,"AITA for reporting and getting a woman fired who just lost her husband? The other day, I was driving through a commercial area at a reasonable pace; when suddenly, this giant white van behind me began aggressively tailgating and honking obnoxiously at me. I sped up a bit, and after a while of continuing this the car blew past me like a bat out of hell and cut in **very** aggressively in front of me, forcing me to slam my brakes on. This very well could have caused an accident. They pulled the same crap with the car in front of them, sped around them, getting in front of them (fortunately not as erratically as last time), and reaching a patch clear of cars, they sped well above the speed limit until they were out of my sight.

Unfortunately for that driver, I got a very clear glimpse of their face, and of the huge logo on the side of their car, which was clearly a company vehicle. Later that day, I Googled the company name, called their number, and filed a complaint with the woman’s assistant manager; describing her physically (mid 40’s, red hair, glasses, etc.). The assistant manager’s voice went soft and sad when I finished describing her, and he told me that that employee just lost her husband today in an accident.

From what he told me, it sounds like when I encountered her she had just gotten a call her husband was in critical condition in the hospital, and was on her way back to her workplace to return the car and take off. I responded that I was very sorry to hear this, but that it doesn’t excuse her driving like an asshole and putting other people at risk. The guy continued to give me details about this lady (she’s hardworking, has three kids, etc.), details about the death and their sympathy for her, and I responded like a broken record: “No excuse for driving like an asshole.”

The man said he’d “talk it over” with her, which did not sound at all like the kind of response appropriate for an employee driving recklessly; the excessive sympathy/excuse-making bothered me too. I had the sickening feeling that he’d greatly minimize the situation, or maybe even sweep it under the rug completely. I **could** have just dropped it and moved on with my life, but I didn’t. 

The next day, I called and asked to be connected with the manager of the company. I was put on the phone with him, and I reported the whole incident. He seemed astonished and horrified, apologized profusely and made **zero** excuses. I told him how I’d heard she lost her husband and I’m sorry, and he responded that that “isn’t an excuse”, and that “it will be a difficult decision we have to make, but it will be the only way we can ensure the highest standards of safety.” This comment, among a couple others, made it very clear to me that they are now planning on firing her.

3637,"AITA for asking to speak to a manager Throwaway because some of my real-life friends know my Reddit name.

I know how it sounds from the title. Please, hear me out before you smash that YTA button.

About a week ago I went out to dinner with my girlfriend to celebrate our one-year dating anniversary. We chose a nice restaurant, not too upscale, and had a good dinner there. Trouble arose, however, when it came to dessert.

I have a nut allergy. It's not at the level of ""a tiny nut fragment will send me to the ER"", but I still prefer to avoid nuts and anything that contains them, just in case. So of course, I asked the waiter which of the desserts had nuts in them, and it turned out to be all of them. (Side note: I would think a restaurant would have a nut-free dessert option, it's not like allergies like mine are uncommon, but that's beside the point.) I was almost resigned to skip dessert, when I saw that in the menu they had a Hazelnut Waffle with Vanilla Ice Cream, and so I asked if I could just get a scoop of vanilla ice cream, hold the waffle. I was told sure, and the waiter went off to fetch our desserts.

He came back a couple minutes later, and told me he wouldn't serve me the ice cream, even without the waffle. The reason? They didn't make their own ice cream, it was store-bought, and on the label was written: ""may contain traces of soy and nuts"".

I thought this was ridiculous. This was vanilla ice cream we were talking about. And even if there was a trace of nuts in the ice cream, I know from experience that just a trace isn't enough to trigger my allergies. (Also I always carry an epi-pen with me, just in case.) I said as much to the waiter, but still he wouldn't budge: ""Miss, I won't serve you the ice cream,"" I was told.

We argued back and forth for a good five minutes, me trying to explain and him still firmly (but very politely) refusing, and that's when I did it. I asked to speak to a manager.

The waiter said ok, went away, and came back with the manager in tow; I explained to him what had happened, calmly and politely, without making a scene; he asked the waiter if what I said was what happened the waiter confirmed it, and then the manager apologised for the inconvenience, and told the waiter to bring me the ice cream.

At the end of the dinner we paid and left, and we left our usual tip because aside from the ice cream incident the dinner (and the service) was completely pleasant.

My girlfriend didn't say anything about it, we joked about it a bit in the car on the way back home, but then we just dropped it.

But I still feel a bit guilty about this. I mean, the waiter was worried about my health (even if he was in the wrong), was very polite about the whole thing, and I basically did the equivalent of ratting him out to his boss. I didn't want him to get in trouble about it, and maybe I did put him in trouble? I don't know, really.

So, folks, AITA here?","YTA.

The server was refusing to serve you the ice cream because he didn't want to get in trouble if you suffered a health issue. Honestly, if you wanted store-bought vanilla ice cream that badly you could've just gone to the store and bought some?

3638,"AITA for lying all the time? Hey guys,

so I know that nobody likes a liar. Neither do I. But somehow I just can't help myself - whenever a little lie is much more convenient than the truth and I know that nobody cares enough to check the facts, I lie.

Sometimes it's just that the lie is easier to explain. For example, if someone asks me why I look so tired, the answer might be that before going to bed, I spilled a huge mug of tea behind my counter and I spent half the night taking my kitchen apart and trying to soak up the moisture. But it's easier to just say ""I didn't sleep well"".

When I'm late because I spent too much time on reddit and forgot that I still had to take a shower, I will say that I took the wrong train because I feel like that's somehow more excusable. However, I would never say that an old lady fell at the stairs and I stayed with her until an ambulance arrived. Even if it actually happened, I would probably still go with ""wrong train"".

And if I tell a funny story, I add a ton of details hoping to make it more entertaining.

On more serious issues, I'm completely honest though. And I never blame anyone else for my mistakes, I usually just find a more likeable excuse.

3640,"WIBTA for charging my little cousin for her costume? Disclaimer: my grammar is horrible, forgive me. 

Edit- Thanks for bringing me to my senses Reddit. As one of y'all said I let my being upset cloud my judgement, and I forgot the whole reason why I did this.

A little backstory here my aunt is extremely religious and does not allow my cousins to go trick or treating as it's the ""devil's birthday"". My little cousins (9 and 13) are always pretty bummed about this. A month ago we were celebrating sue's(9) birthday I brought up that Halloween was coming around and it would be cool to have a movie night. Jane(13) says ""we've always wanted to go trick or treating"". I felt for her because I also grew up religious and I knew the feeling of being left out. I said ""well I have Thursdays off and I could take y'all trick or treating if y'all want"", their faces lit up instantly they were pretty stoked. I then said "" with one two conditions you need permission from both your parents and they're gonna pay for your costumes"". They both agreed. About a week ago Jane tells me she finally got permission from both her parents and we set up a shopping date for Saturday. Fast forward to yesterday, I head over to pick her up. She hops in and we start talking about the costume ideas. Then she says, "" I only have 14 dollars from the candy I sold"" I ask her ""didn't your dad give you money?"" She responded ""no"". I said okay we can work with that but cheap and it'll be okay. She ended up choosing to be female Luigi and Sue would be female mario. She found some tutus that were 4 bucks so she paid for both of em. We went looking for the shirts and socks. Shirt ended up being 5 and socks 7. Clearly she wasn't going to afford it so I bit it and paid for it, thinking that maybe her dad would pay me later. Fast forward to today when I told my mom about this and she said my uncle told her that he told me cousin he was not going to pay for any type of costumes. Hearing this I knew I was not going to get my money back ever.  If I had money I would not mind paying for everything because I know what it's like to want to do what other kids do, but I can't help but feel that she was kinda shitty about not telling me what her dad said. I also keep thinking that I should've told her we ain't buying anything over 14 bucks before we even went to the store, but I didn't want to be a dick.

3642,"AITA for driving on the left lane? I was driving in I-95 (MD)on the left lane going with the flow of traffic. There were several cars ahead of me and I was keeping up with them, we we're about 5 MPH over the limit. 


I then notice a car right behind me, following very closely/tailgating. The car would every now and then swerve further left perhaps to indicate that it was behind me. I could have moved to my right, even though there were cars on the immediate right lane (total of four lanes) I could've done it if I wanted to. But seeing that there were at least 10-15 cars ahead of me in this lane going around the same speed, I couldn't see how it could've helped him. Perhaps every single car would move to their right for this person to speed up on left lane? Anyway I didn't move, specially since it wouldn't have helped the tailgater anyway and I find tailgating extremely a-hole move. The person finally gave up and moved to extreme right and after that I didn't care to notice them. 

State of MD doesn't have left lane pass only law, but I still feel a little guilty. Was I being an absolute ass hole here?





**Edit/update**: I appreciate all the feedback. I didn't write this to get a vindication on my action. I genuinely asked for my reference in the future. 


There has been a mixed response, some saying I am the lowest grade of the society and saying I am the asshole while others saying I didn't have much option. The summary I draw is that ESH.


First of all, me moving to the right wouldnt have done anything except for the tailgater getting one car ahead and me slowing down on my path. It really wouldn't have in any way contributed to a better traffic flow. As /u/7njedocye pointed out, it's not efficient to just leave the left lane empty in this situation. I always use the left lane for passing only if the lane is used for that (such as in NJ turnpike).  I'd have driven faster if I had the choice, had there been no cars ahead of me in the left lane. I didn't want to go to right as that lane was much slower than the speed I was going with.


On the same token, if everybody thinks the way I thought then the left lane will be always clogged. Perhaps the biggest asshole was the car in front of the queue of cars going in the left lane; but I certainly didn't make the situation better. Will I use left lane as passing only? Not always; but because of the input I got, I probably will use it more for passing than usual. ","YTA -  you and every asshole that drives the left lane without passing should rot in hell.

When walking out I realize I threw my receipt away with lunch trash. 

(Costco employee checks receipt when you exit to deter theft, though there is a large sign that says “we check your receipt to make sure you paid the right price and got the right items,” but its a ridiculous notion that they know the correct prices and would catch a mistake in the process.) Anyway, on to the alleged assholery.

Only bought 4 things, didn’t think it would be a big deal.

Me “I accidentally threw my receipt away with lunch”

Me “No thanks, I’m going to go.”

Two years ago I got an email from my boss saying hey we need someone to learn coworkers job and you're the first person we thought of, would you be interested? Being a huge people pleaser I said sure.

Since then it's been horrible for me. I got warned by every person in the building how difficult she is. I figure she can't truly be that bad so I stick it out. Guys biggest mistake ever.

I have a medical condition that causes me to not be good most of the time. I'm there and putting 150% but you can tell I'm in pain. She admits she uses the same condition to get out of work because she doesnt want to work.

My main issue is she won't do her job. I'm supposed to do all the stuff, except for the stuff she refuses to show me that she'll do later. Main problem is the phones. We're supposed to answer them, set appointments, answer questions. She'll watch it ring or hover her hand over it and won't touch it because it's not her job. Well heres the thing. When I started I said I'd never do phones, I'm petrified of them. I started slowly doing them and now I'm on them six days a week. I have a legit fear of them due to an ex that magically has found me before and I'm petrified he will again. She just hates them.

As long as we get the manager and director to agree I'll be taking over our sister place and doing the warranty for there. Which means coworker is gonna be mad at them not needing her as much.

3648,"WIBTA If I Don't Tell My Parents About Their Truck Repair? To start off, I have put myself in quite a pickle and morale delima. So here's the back story, I am a (23M) that is still in College and paying for all of my tuition and expenses. Over this past weekend I had to move out of my apartment and I needed a truck to move all of my furniture and etc. My parents have a fully loaded GMC Sierra Denali truck and they allowed me to borrow it for the week. You must also understand that this truck is my Dad's baby and keeps this truck immaculate, this also the first time he has ever let me borrow it. 

So, fast forward to last night; my roommate and I decided to go get Sonic and I volunteered to drive. I honestly volunteered because I love this truck and I just want to ride around in it any chance I get because it's a million times nicer than my POS car. Anyways, we get our food and I start to back out of the slot and I get half way out and hear a horrible screech. Roommate gets out to look and I ask how bad is it? Thinking maybe it's just a little scratch it'll buff right out and he says it's bad.  My heart just sank and my anxiety levels shot through the roof. 

After taking the night to try and decide what I should. I decided I'll try and save my pride and trust that my parents had in me and find a place that can repair it. I called over 6 body shops this morning and only found one place that said they could fix it by this weekend. I looked at their reviews and it seems like they do good work so, I brought it over to their place for an estimate. After they took a look they told me that they would have to fix the dent in the door and repaint the whole door (rear passenger) and half of the front passenger door that way it can all blend and match the paint. 

Next came the haggling, I told them my situation and asked if they could cut me any breaks. I think the guy honestly felt bad for me and he knocked 300 bucks off the estimate. However, that estimate is still around 950 dollars. Fourntuantly, I previously finished a internship that paid me really well and I have a enough to cover it. So, I sucked it up and told them to go ahead and fix it for that quoted price. 

Now, here is my internal battle that I have going on in my head, should I tell them even after the repair and keep their trust in tack or spill the beans?

We had plans to hit a good job, save money, and settle down in a few years. We have been here almost 2 years now. She talks about moving but again, it’s been almost 2 years. She also is getting fed up with her bf because they’re not really compatible (they were together for about 3-4 months max before she found out she was pregnant.) 

Before all of this, i met my boyfriend while we were both in high school. We dated online for years until we finally met one another last year. Needless to say it was worth the wait and is the most amazing man in the world. My mom likes him and was going to let us stay with her for as long as we want (I wanted forever cause were really close and enjoy being around one another.). The offer still stands (maybe not forever but he can move in with us if he really wants to) but now that the bay is in the picture, he wants nothing to do with coming over here. Even visiting would be enough to annoy him to no end. My boyfriend borderline hates the thing because it’s loud, annoying, and takes up all my time since I babysit all day. (5 am-5:30/6pm) 

Because my mom wants to move out and stuff(and because I’m in the middle of nowhere with no babysitters and the only daycare is $200 a week from 8am-4pm I think) I want to help her out. I don’t want her to struggle cause I love her and she’s always helped me out. She didnt even really want another child but her boyfriend convinced her, even saying “if you don’t wanna him, I’ll take him!” ... Let’s just say if anything happens to my mom, she wants me to raise the baby. 

My boyfriend says it’s not my problem or responsibility, that she’s a grown woman that can take care of herself. He wants me to move up where he lives and be together. I want the same but I don’t wanna abandon my mom. He says I’ll be there forever, which would probably be true if he broke up with me. I told him I wanna stay for another year or 2 max to help her, but he’s sick of us not being together and so am I. I’m also sick of watching the thing, I DONT EVEN LIKE KIDS AND DONT PLAN ON HAVING ANY. 


Am I the Asshole for not wanting to ditch her? 

TLDR; boyfriend is getting annoyed I wanna help my mom out with her new baby and not move out for another year or 2. He wants me to move up with him soon (like this year) and I want to, but again, I don’t wanna abandon her. 

Edit: people are upset I call the baby a thing. It’s a joke and I forget not everyone is in on it. I don’t hate him, it’s just a funny nickname to me. 

Edit 2: i just realized I never mentioned this. I get paid $100 a week from watching him 5 days a week. Also if they have to do laundry or go to the store after work, (which is a trip in itself). Laundry days take all day since our wash is broke and the closest Walmart is 40 mins away. Bilo is 15 but doesn’t have a big selection and we can’t get certain foods/household things from there. AND MY MOM HAS NEVER ASKED ME TO STAY. She would love it if I did, she knows I have to have my own life and says she’ll figure it out if she needs to. It just breaks my heart her having to struggle. She did her best to give me a good life and she succeeded. Even working 3 jobs at one point to make sure we always had food and a roof over our heads. She’s the best mom and friend I could ever ask for. ","YTA, or more accurately, your mom is

3657,"AITA for asking my friend to come to my birthday dinner? This happened a couple months ago, but I still want to know.

I have had the same best friend since sophomore year of high school (I am now in my sophomore year of college). When we graduated I went away to college and she decided to stay and go to college nearby and live at home. Because of this, we don't get to see each other much at all.

&#x200B;

This year, my birthday fell right in the middle of finals. I did nothing to celebrate, and so when I got home from school for break I thought it would be nice for our group of friends to get together and get dinner for my birthday (and to also all catch up).

When I invited my Katie (fake name), she said she had plans with a guy she had been seeing for about a month. I told her she should bring him, we would all love to meet him. She said no, they had plans for that night to exchange Christmas gifts and watch Harry Potter and cook dinner together. I asked her if maybe they could just skip the making dinner part and eat with us, and then they could leave and have the rest of the night together. She refused. I told her I just would really like to see everyone for my birthday, and she said, ""I didn't realize your birthday was such a big deal to you"".

&#x200B;

This was essentially the last straw in our friendship (she had blown me off before). She said I was asking for too much and being a jerk, I said she wasn't a good friend. Was I the asshole for asking her to adjust her plans?

&#x200B;

Edit: Not quite sure if this adds to the story or not, but I thought it might be helpful to add that everyone in the group (including myself) was trying to adjust to her schedule to make it work. Also, the previous 4 times I had visited home she had cancelled our plans or made an excuse as to why she couldn't come.","YTA you asked she declined, and gave you a reason, not that she owed you one, and you kept pushing and harping until she snapped.",1,YTA,0.0,0.0,1
3660,"AITA for making jokes/comments about my roommate being sick okay, so this just happened an hour or two ago so bear with me. i’m on my phone and have been drinking a little bit and need to know if what i did was wrong and or offensive and or however redditors may deem my actions.

Now, my roommate has been sick for... about a month or so. she has asthma and contracted bronchitis sometime in the middle of December. She went on a cruise bc her bf’s parents paid for her since cruises are relatively cheap, whatever. she gets back 8-9 days later, sick as a fucking dog. Exhausted her asthma and is taking a shit ton of medication. sometimes her coughing wakes me up in the night/morning. 

Our relationship has been pretty good, we started living together July 2018 and haven’t gotten into a fight or anything aggressive like that. We joke around and roast each other often, if not daily. we’ve gotten close in the short time we’ve lived together and i do consider her a close friend. From what i understand there’s a general understanding of each others humor and up until now she hasn’t said anything about the way i joke around with her/there hasn’t been a problem with my humor. I’m the type of person who doesn’t really get offended by anything and have a thick skin for offensive jokes. i myself can be an offensive joker. 

So she gets home i’m talking to her in her room and she starts coughing, you know, because of the exhausted asthma and bronchitis. i notice she’s not covering her mouth. so i go;

“Damn girl cover your mouth ya nasty”. 

she responds with
“it’s my room” 
and doesn’t say much after that from what i remember 

now i don’t think much of it if anything bc i had been drinking a little tonight so nothing is really phasing me at that moment. 

Her boyfriend comes over, she’s heating up some soup and then takes a napkin and coughs up a goober, folds it AND PUTS IT ON THE FUCKING KITCHEN TABLE. I was kinda -very- disgusted and was astounded that she had done that. i’m kinda a germaphobe when it comes to shit like that. So i say to her loudly , due to sheer shock

“girl, that’s fucking nasty get that off the kitchen table” 

she says 
“it’s in a napkin and i folded it”

me:
“dude, you have ejected something out of your body and is now on the kitchen table, that’s gross”

she looks at me and silently throws the tissue away, grabs her soup and leaves the kitchen, her and her bf walk into the living room, he kinda gave me a look, something like an eeeeeeh sort of deal. i can understand a social que when it’s staring me in the face so i follow her into the living room. 

i asked her if she was mad and she said yes, because i had been coming at her the whole night and or a lot recently, by making comments about her being sick and used her coughing in her room as the example. she started sniffling and her eyes were watery. 

when she said that i kinda got mad because if what i was saying was bothering her all she had to do was tell me. which is what i told her before because i do acknowledge that i can be offensive/intense at times and if anything i said bothered her then i would just stop joking about that thing. it’s just simple as that. but the issue is she doesn’t like confrontation and that was something we talked about last night. 

I mean don’t get me wrong, i have horrible communication skills and it’s hard for me not to come across as aggressive/ angry when i’m trying express the issue i have with someone (childhood trauma yada yada). but i’ll let someone know if what they’re doing it’s hurting/bothering me in some way. 

So after she said what she had to say, i went on the defensive side and said

“i’m sorry my half hearted joke affected you that much, i didn’t think it would. i won’t joke about it again if you feel so strongly about it”. 

which was kinda passive aggressive, but in my defense i look at it as her being unable to communicate to me that she has an issue with something and then blows up on me bc she couldn’t tell me she had a problem with it in the first place. 

I don’t want to be blown up on like that, it makes me feel like a bad person for not knowing how someone felt about something but i only know it’s a problem if you bring it up to me... 

she hasn’t said anything to me and i don’t think she going to but her bf in passing made light conversation with me. and i passive aggressively changed my hulu password while they were using it because i was upset/got no closure/annoyed. but i pay for it so...

My husbands birthday is today and we planned a cabin trip up north with another one of our couples friends to go snowboarding, play games, relax, etc. I will refer to this couple as Ann & Chris. Ann & Chris confirmed with us weeks ago that they are planning on coming with us, they just had to finish work and would be heading up later than we would so we will be driving separate. Now this other couple who we routinely hangout with, Andy & April, were also invited but Andy couldn’t make it due to working the weekend. We were bummed but still happy to have some of our friends with us for the trip to celebrate my husbands birthday. Fast forward to New Years Eve. We were hanging out with these same two couples. April brought up how bummed she was to not be able to come because her husband has to work. We all sympathized and said it was unfortunate but we would try to do another trip up north soon that we could all make it to. She then joked about just coming up herself and we didn’t really confirm or deny if she could just said something along the lines of “haha yeah maybe.”  Well yesterday Ann & Chris show up late and April is with them. I was asleep at the time, and so only my husband was there to greet them & help them get their stuff inside. He woke me up last night and told me about how she had come after he had come to bed. We had no idea she was coming and don’t have the food prep etc for her. I’m a little upset at Ann & Chris for not mentioning it, but mainly angry at April for just showing up.

I said, ""sorry"" , but not loudly.  This made her start asking who I was talking to.  She started getting upset that someone else was in the kitchen.

3663,"WIBTA if I don't tell my husband our mutal friend came on to me? Short version is the title. Here's the longer one:

My husband, some friends and I were hanging out at a bar for a few hours last weekend before deciding to grab a bite to eat. The place we were headed was a few blocks from where I live, so I offered a quick smoke session before we went to the restaurant. Only one person took me up on the offer: Zack.

Zack and I have always had a slightly closer relationship than my husband had with him but it has always been platonic. Since I've known Zack, he's been married to a wonderful woman and has two beautiful kids with a third on the way. He's always come off as the ultimate family man -- respectable, loyal, kind. This particular night, his wife stayed home so he could have a night out. 

Keeping in mind that my husband and I saw him as a trustworthy guy, Zack and I went back to my place to smoke while everyone else went to the restaurant. As we're sitting on my porch passing the pipe back and  forth, I make a jokey, off-hand remark about how hot his wife is and he says that she's got nothing on me.

I could hear the record scratch sound effect in my head. I'm pretty drunk and well on my way to being stoned so I take another hit instead of address the bomb dropped in front of me. He tells me that he's had a huge crush on me for years. I tell him it's flattering but we should get back to my husband and  our friends.

We go to the restaurant and everything is normal. All of us are having a great conversation and downing several bottles of wine. My husband invites everyone to our place once dinner is over to use the hot tub. Only Zack accepts. I don't stop it because I figure that as long as my husband is around it'll be fine. 

Zack keeps inching closer to me in the hot tub as my husband is starting to fall asleep. Zack says something about how it'd be fun for him to bring his wife over and we could all have a real good time - he wouldn't even care if me or my husband had sex with her. I try to laugh it off as a crude joke and suggest we get out of the tub.

While my husband is in the bathroom changing, Zack asks me for a kiss. I tell him no and my husband comes out a moment later. 

He offers to let Zack crash at our place because all of us are clearly wasted. Zack agrees. My (sweet, dear, oblivious) husband says he's going bed but Zack and I should smoke up more. I honestly don't know why I didn't just say I was tired and  go to bed.

I find myself back on the porch with Zack. At one point, he looks me up and down and  says, ""Can I get one little kiss? No one will ever know.""

I say no and remind him of how much I love my husband, how much Zack loves his family, and that it's not worth it to throw it all away. I ask him to leave, which he does without protest.

I haven't talked to Zack since and don't plan to. I also don't plan on allowing myself to get into a one on one situation with Zack again. Ultimately, all of us were in an intoxicated fog and nothing happened, so WIBTA if I never mentioned it to my husband?



My husband is a wonderful guy (I couldn't love anyone more) and I know that telling him is going to be uncomfortable but it's the right thing to do. I'm ashamed it took the internet to get me to do what my gut has been telling me to do since that night.

3669,"WIBTA if I throw out everything that has peppers in it that gets bought for my family? It really makes me laugh sometimes about how little my family believes me, or rather how they’d rather think I blow everything out of proportion for the sake of it.

Last Tuesday I was in our living room which is just on the other side of the kitchen. My stepdad decided he wanted to cook himself a frozen paella, something I dread him doing because every time he does my throat starts to close up and I start feeling sick. 

And wouldn’t you know it but the very same thing happened again... but this time was by far the worst. My throat swoll up, I got migraines, my nose became blocked, my eyes stung and I even started struggling to breath properly. I ended up spending the rest of the day and the next three in bed since I ended up catching a cold immediately after as well. 

Now, when you hear this the first thing most people think of is “allergic reaction”. The first thing *my* family thinks is “a bad cold” or “exaggerating”.

Well, since I knew you don’t stop breathing from a cold I decided to look into whether ingredients in a paella other than seafood (which I eat) could cause this reaction and my answer was peppers and paprika, which I then realised was an ingredient in other foods that made me sick like chilli. 

I was still sceptical, so I asked the people on r/medicaladvice whether or not these symptoms were worrisome. And boy was the answer terrifying. A doctor replied saying that the reaction I had was dangerous and I was lucky to not have gone into anaphylactic shock.
Just to clarify, people who go into shock from an allergy *could die if not treated in time*. So I’m in the full swing of “holy shit this could actually kill me” and decide to avoid peppers as much as I could. 

But when I told my mum about this she said we don’t know exactly what I’m reacting to so they’ll still be eating peppers and stuff with paprika in it. 

Say what now? I know it’s the paprika and peppers, it’s the only consistency between all the dishes that cause my reactions and even if you weren’t sure why the fuck would you think it was okay to keep cooking that stuff?

Which comes to today, where I’m in my bedroom with the door closed, my sheets over my face and my windows wide open in the middle of winter while I hope I don’t smell the chilli they’re cooking. 

A bit too much? Probably, but I’ve never had a reaction before and it’s really fucking scary to think that one small spice causes that much pain. What’s worse is that one seems to care and no matter what I say I either get yelled down by my stepdad or told by my mum that I’m over reacting. And this is why I gave up telling them when my throat would swell up from the smell of peppers in the first place and just put it down to coincidence: because I’m never taken seriously.

Well now I’m pissed and am planning on throwing out everything that gets bought with peppers or paprika in it, no matter what it is or how expensive it was. But before I start my pepper massacre I just want to know if I WBTA for doing it.

Edit: to verify, I can’t go to the doctors for a proper check up because I can’t go by myself for personal reasons and my parents refuse to take me because they don’t think I need to be checked. There is literally no one else who I can go with so I’m basically stuck with just avoiding the stuff as much as possible.

Also, reading back on this I realise I am being over the top simply from anger at being called a liar which is pretty childish; I’m going to try and go to the doctors, as much as I want to be throwing those things away out of spite it won’t solve anything.

3678,"WIBTA if I got my dad a dog? Backstory: My dog died 3 years ago. We had her for 18 years (she was 22, and a bichon frise). I think having a dog would be good for my dad, who has been laid off again after years of unstable work. He recently had a series of heart attacks and has been trying to eat better but does not exercise. The dog would help get him out, and improve his mood in general. 

Living situation: my parents have been divorced for ~15 years. However, after the economy crashed, they moved back in together. My parents and I have lived in a 2-bedroom apartment for 10 years. (My mom and I share a room, my dad has his own room). My boyfriend sleeps on the couch ~4 days a week, because we carpool to college. So, in the apartment it's me (24M), my boyfriend (22M), my mom (56F) and my dad (60M). 

My mom doesn't want another dog because she doesn't want to get attached and then have to leave the dog when she moves out. (She thinks she will move out when I do -- but none of us can afford to live on our own, so realistically, I don't see this happening for at least 4 years (when I get out of graduate school)). 

My dad doesn't want another dog because he can't afford it. This is generally true, however, I can pay for the adoption fee and initial needs like bedding and leashes and bowls etc. The major concern is that if/when the dog gets sick, he would have to open a new line of credit and pay it off gradually. (I am open to doing so as well, as is my boyfriend. There are also lots of reduced-cost clinics in the area, the major concern is more about emergencies.) Every time we see a dog when we're out, he says he wishes he could have another dog. 

I've been mulling this over for years, but obviously haven't done anything about it, because I understand and respect my parents' concerns. I've brought it up to my mom, and she has been less and less resistant over the years, but she also agrees that another financial burden would be difficult. However, after my dad's heart attacks, it's clear that he needs some motivator to get out of the apartment. He has too much stress and there's not a lot anyone can do about it. A dog would bring some much needed happiness. 

Throwaway account because no one likes being the asshole (though, this situation is fairly specific so I'm sure if anyone I know sees it they'll know it's me; but they all think I should get the dog anyway). We're talking like a 15lb dog MAX. Small, small dog. Since my dad is currently unemployed he would be home 100% of the time to train it at first, so imo this is a good time to get it.



EDIT/UPDATE: Financial situation hasn't changed much from 3 years ago when my dog died. The only change is my father's health. We did this with a dog for years and it was fine. It was a little hard at the end when she was elderly and regularly needed expensive vet care (like dialysis, surgeries, etc) but we cut costs in other parts of life where we could -- put off car maintenance longer than we'd like but still well within safety, etc. I think if we all pitched in we could afford it reasonably -- we did before. In a worst case scenario in which my parents would want to rehome the dog -- the dog would stay with us until we could find it a suitable home. My boyfriend and I would reach out to friends and their friends to see if anyone could take it. It  would NOT go back to the shelter and we would keep tabs on its wellbeing.","YTA - pets as unexpected presents is a bad idea. Especially when:.

3681,"Am I the asshole for bugging my brother a lot about reading some things? Often, my brother and I find works of fiction that we enjoy, and want the other to read. We enjoy talking to each other a lot, so we want the other to watch/read/play stuff so we can talk about it.

The problem is that my brother is incredibly flakey about trying things that I want him to try, even though he'll still find new things to try on his own.

A few years back, I read the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series, and loved it. And I knew he would love it to. So I asked him to read it. He said he would later when he felt like it. At that time, the situation I just described wasn't really in place, so I didn't think much of it. Still, it was often at the back of my head that he still hadn't.

A few months ago *at least* two years later, he decided to read it. And it was only because he decided to use it for a school project. Excuse me if I think that gives him a bit of a poor record.

Right now, I can think of 11 things I want him to do. And I am certain there are more. I'd like it if he could finish the Hitchhiker's Guide series (since he only read the first 1 or 2), play 5 videogames (though I think I lost one, so maybe 4), read 4 webcomics, and watch 1 short webseries. He has done none of those things. Some have been things I wanted him to do for years, while some are more recent.

In the last few years, despite the fact that there have been many things I've asked him to do, he has still started a bunch of things on his own. Scratch that, he's gone actively looking for them. Yet, every single thing I want him to do, he says he'll get to ""sometime, when he feels like it."" I'm pretty sure that's going to be never.

Recently, I did get him to play a videogame. And he *really, really* like it. It was Fire Emblem: Awakening. But of course, he had to take a good thing and turn it into a bad thing. It started with one playthrough. Then it turned into one, but with frequent delays where he started the game again to test things out and do them differently. Now it's his original playthrough that is still unfinished, one on Lunatic difficulty that he's still far from getting through, and a promise of *another* one once he's done where he will min/max character stats. Basically, it's turned into a gigantic waste of time. He spends a ridiculous amount of time playing it, and yet he still seems to go through at a snail's pace. I don't even care about it anymore. 

I've gotten him to read the beginnings of all the webcomics I want him to read. For each one, he's thought they were pretty good. And even said that he'll probably read them. He has yet to read any. A couple I've been waiting for for years, the other two for months. He still isn't getting around to it. And what bothers me the most is that he literally does nothing all day.

I'm serious. He's already gone down the rabbit hole of staying up too late every night and taking naps during the afternoon. But he just spends hours each day accomplishing so little. Today, he's made a new Mii Fighter in Smash Bros., then proceeded to literally screw around with it, just running around on stages doing nothing, for hours. He's currently rewatching an episode of a show he's already seen. He also spends a long time checking reddit (even though he still insists he's not really a redditor), checking a forum (and he refreshes it once every ten minutes), and just randomly rereading comics and blog posts he's already seen. He literally thinks about how bored he is, then thinks of some random thing he's already done that he can do, and does it for dozens of minutes. And yet it never occurs to him to do one of the things I want him to do.

Right now, I've been taking a fairly active approach in trying to get him to read some webcomics. As in, reminding him several times a day that it is a thing he could be doing. He's been getting pretty annoyed about it. Says that it's actively making him *not* want to because of how aggravating it is. And he insists that if I just left him alone, he'd get around to it. I don't care when he says that. Because he's constantly demonstrated that no, he won't. Even if it annoys him, bringing it up often will keep it in his mind. Because it never is if I let him be.

Also, for a while, we had a thing going where I'd watch/do something he wanted me to do, then he'd return the favor. That system worked pretty well because for a while, we were actually decent about it. We weren't super strict, and we tried to actually return the favor. Until he just straight-up stopped. Not once did he ever do something in exchange for me again. Which, of course, led to me getting a bit more strict about it. And naturally, that led to him saying that he never really agreed to it in the first place. Which would obviously happen, because our system was never really meant for strict exchanges. It only worked because we were reasonable. But of course he'd start saying that once I had watched a ton of things he wanted me to watch, with nothing from him.

He admittedly does do a better job of asking once, then just letting me be. But I feel like that's because I've been much more willing to do things for him. When he asks me to do something and I say I don't feel like it, that's usually meant that I'll do it the next day. And I usually have. But when I ask him to do something and he says he doesn't feel like it, that usually means he's never going to do it. And 97% of the time, he hasn't.

Am I the asshole for bugging him a lot about reading some webcomics?

Sorry if I was just rambling or it didn't make sense.

EDIT: Another thing he does is maybe give something a shot *once*, then try dangling that over my head forever. With one webcomic, the one he had the best chance of reading, he once read about 14 pages on his own. Then proceeded to do nothing for weeks/months. But if I bring it up, he always claims he *does* get to things even though it's basically an outlier.","Yes. It's just some webcomics, man. I get that you want to share things with your brother, but I think by reminding him multiple times a day that you want him to do that is making him resent you and it ruining things that you could share.

3682,"AITA for objecting to my wife wanting to dye my 4 year old son's hair pink? My wife texted me at work today. She said that my 4 year old son wanted to dye his hair pink, and asked me if I had any objections. I replied that I was okay with it, but I would appreciate if she chose a gender neutral color. 

In the next text I got from her, she blew up at me and said that she's ""going to dye it green instead but only because it was okay with him"" (he had asked for green hair the day before so I was a little surprised when my wife said he wanted pink). Then she went into a paragraph long rant about how I need to think about why pink is not an acceptable color to me. She went on to say that I don't seem to want my son to do anything feminine. So, I must think that a boy acting feminine is bad, and therefore I’m saying that a boy trying to be like his mom in any way is a bad thing, and that way of thinking is ""sexist bullshit"". 

My wife likes to dye her own hair various colors, and is often outfitted in very colorful ways. I don't object to any of this. She's an adult and can express herself however she chooses. It's not my particular style, but I've never criticized her for the way she chooses to look. 

I'm completely fine with teens and adults expressing themselves through their style. But I don't think young children have the maturity to understand that a style choice can sometimes come with unintended consequences. My son thinks ""pink is a bright color, it'd be neat if my hair was that color!"" He doesn't realize that going to school the next day with pink hair could very easily invite mockery from his classmates. He's already a shy kid. I don't want him to be isolated from his peer group for something like this. He doesn't understand the greater context, but his mother and I do. So, we should protect him from things like this. I'm not trying to stifle his individualism or anything. I'm just trying to protect him from a world that he hasn't yet learned to live in.

I have no problem with my son doing traditionally feminine things. We cook meals together. We clean the house together. Sometimes he’ll play with baby dolls, or watch cartoons clearly marketed to girls. I've never dissuaded him from following his natural interests in any way. I think my wife is reacting to something under the surface here that I'm not aware of. She thinks I'm trying to make our son into some antiquated version of a mainly man, but I'm just trying to protect him from making a choice he doesn't fully understand the repercussions of. He’s only 4. He doesn’t need to be a soldier on the front line of some social justice war to redefine what it is to be masculine. 

TLDR: My wife wants to dye my 4 year old son’s hair pink. I think it’s a bad idea because it will invite bullying. She thinks I’m a sexist asshole. I don’t want my kid used as a pawn to redefine society’s idea of what it means to be a “boy”.",YTA Your wife is right. Your attitude is sexist.

3683,"AITA for being upset that my sister won't take me dress shopping with her? I just recently found out that my older sister is planning on going wedding dress shopping when she goes home to visit our family. The reason why I am upset is that she has told all of the other bridesmaids her plan and left me out of it. Normally, this might seem like a younger sister upset that she's not getting her way.

But the main part that I am upset is that I currently work in the bridal industry. Every time I try to offer help or advice towards certain elements, she ignores me. Being in the wedding industry means that I have the timeline for when you should be booking certain things and most importantly buying the dress.

I found out through a mutual friend who happens to be the MoH, who mentioned the trip to me when we were talking about planning the bachelorette party, and she was shocked that I knew nothing of it. She also mentioned a designer that my sister is looking at, and that is a big seller at the bridal studio I have connections at. I know my sister is trying to keep costs low due to her and her fiance paying for everything themselves, so I don't understand why she wouldn't want to use my connections to get a lower price on the dress.

IDK, I just don't understand why I am being left out of this, like she's left me out of a lot during our lives.

EDIT: I realize that I left this out (I apologize I'm new here to this sub).

3692,"WIBTA For going back on birth control without telling my husband? Hear me out. He's 43 and I'm 39. We'd discussed trying for one several years ago and it so happened that my sil (17 with 2 girls) had a boy around this time
 A beautiful baby who went to bed at 9pm and slept til 9am then napped for 3 hours after lunch. He was so happy and easygoing, just the best little guy, and his mom didn't want him. Trying to avoid CPS getting involved, we took the baby in. Their maternal aunt primarily had the 2 girls. A few times their mom would get them for a day or so or we'd let the baby go to the aunt's house to see his sisters. On such a night, sil gave birth to her 4th child. The first one to have a different father. He was born with drugs in his system so CPS stepped in. Since all 3 were under the paternal aunt's roof when it all went down, and she was willing, the 3 kids were placed with her while the investigation was done. It was awful; my husband and I were so devastated we could barely look at each other or speak without crying. Despite everyone, including sil, telling CPS we'd had him for over 2 years, they made him stay. In the end, paternal rights were terminated and custody given to paternal aunt. We worked out her having all 3 of them Mon-Thurs and us from after school Thurs thru Sun. The baby stuff got put on hold but also we now have this expense.

Some other girl overheard us and started complaining about how much her premiums would increase especially as she has her kids on her plan and that we were being jerks and how much of a nightmare it'd be to have to walk so far out in the cold on smoke breaks. I said basically ""so then quit, that's the point of this."" She didn't take that well.

Honestly as smoking is a choice and a very very bad one I'm not too bothered by such ""discrimination"" and the company is just doing what it can to make most employees' premiums cheaper and keep the workforce healthy. So I really can't feel sorry for smokers at all. Am I being an asshole?","You had me thinking you were in the right here until I read it all out.

3709,"AITA for misinterpreting this pediatrician’s practice and leaving bad reviews? My family and I have recently relocated, and I’m trying to find my son a new therapist.  I searched our insurance website for in-network providers, and it gave me several numbers, one of which was close by and accepting new patients.  It’s important to mention here that our insurance does not require a referral for mental health services.  Also, for anyone who may not have ever gone seeking a variety of specialists and thus may not be familiar, many medical practices have a variety of doctors and specialists on staff - family physicians, pediatricians, therapists, testing psychologists, psychiatrists, nutritionists - you get the idea.  That was the norm where I lived before.  Also, their website advertised “ADHD and behavioral/emotional specialists,” which, to me, demonstrates an all-encompassing pediatric practice.

So I call this office and explain that I’m looking for a counselor or therapist, and the receptionist tells me that she can help me with that, but only if I contact my insurance company and switch my son’s primary care manager to one of their pediatricians.  I told her that we have found a PCM and are happy with him; all I need is a therapist.  She says, and I quote, “No ma’am, [my insurance company] will refuse to pay for our therapy services if you’re not using our PCMs.”

This is an outright lie, and I was incensed at what appeared to be the obvious money-grubbing of the practice - trying to force us to use their doctors and specialists exclusively for our every need, right?  So I posted a “beware” review to Yelp, Google, and Facebook.  A day later, I get a very angry response to my reviews about how I am “obviously confused” because the practice doesn’t actually have counselors or therapists.  They’re apparently just a group of pediatricians.

So I respond back with my apologies, but pointed out what I was told verbatim by their idiot receptionist and said they should do a better job of training them to effectively communicate the scope of the practice to prospective patients.  

Why not just tell me, “I’m sorry, ma’am, but we are actually a primary care practice and don’t have counselors on staff.  If you’re looking for a PCM for your son, however, we are accepting new patients and would be happy to refer him to a therapist or counselor in your network.”

To which I would have responded, “Thank you for that information.  My insurance company’s website seems to need updating.  We are happy with our PCM, but thank you anyway.”  And that would have been the end of it.  

But they persisted, posting that I should “be more responsible about what [I] post” about their practice.  Am I an asshole?  Should I remove my (since clarified via our public exchange) reviews or are they the assholes I think they are for trying to rope me into the hassle and paperwork involved in making them my son’s PCMs to get a referral I don’t need?  

I feel like they were being intentionally shady, hoping I didn’t know my way around my insurance company, but maybe I’m actually a “Karen?”

Edit/Update: I have taken down the reviews since I have been judged the AH.  I really did prepare myself for some harsh criticism before making this post, although I’ll admit I didn’t expect some of the comments I actually received.  I’m not an “angry” person who “needs therapy” or someone who is a typical Karen who “asks for the manager” all the time.  I fully understand that this may not be my most shining moment, but please know that this isn’t the everyday “me,” which is why I posted to AITA.  Thank you for your honest feedback.  Oh - and I didn’t call the receptionist an idiot outside of this forum.  I think that’s important to note.  Even if everyone still thinks I’m a total Karen, I at least want you all to know that I’m not the kind that name calls people in identifying, public reviews.",YTA. Wow.

One of my friends Lexi surprised us with a new slightly shorter than shoulder length hairstyle. She had always sported long hair until now so that caught me off guard.

3714,"AITA for frequently clowning the extreme Christian sect I broke free from? Trigger warning: A lot of irreverence here. 

I grew up in a more extreme Christian religion, raised moderately at home and in my communities. But  was still frequently subjected to the more radical believers. One of my parents is actively a fucking nutso and culty. That parent allowed their beliefs to cause me trauma when I was young and I spent years as a child in fear of burning in hell or basically being tortured during the end times. I finally started to assess the church abt 8yo ago and explored other beliefs. 

Something pretty huge happened in my life, and once that shit dropped, the best way I can describe is my spiritual beliefs were yanked out from underneath me; I suddenly “lost faith” with no forewarning. Thankfully being pushed out of the spiritual head bubble allowed me to think w/o the spell. I am agnostic now but with a special personal connection to Hinduism, and have been so for 5yrs now. 

I don’t do these things outside my circles of friends, but, the friends I still have that “believe” have recently responded to my jabs at the sect saying I’m being an asshole for acting like I don’t understand the perspective and like i wasn’t JUST a strong believer under a decade ago. They are not offended, just feel like it’s an asshole move to continuously joke on it. Honestly this is like 18yrs in the making for me LOL. Anyway, here are some things they brought up or reacted to: 

- (they believe in keeping the Sabbath holy Fri night-Sat night.) When my friend mentioned going to church on Sat, I told her, “Fuck that Sabbath shit come do shots instead!” This same friend frequently “violates the Sabbath” herself. 

- Me: “Old Testament God is a vengeful trigger happy asshole.... Nothing like Jesus. I know Joseph isn’t the daddy, buuuut are we really sure God is?”

- [insert hilarious and wildly inappropriate sexual joke about the sect’s prophetess] 

- Getting judgy sometimes towards “believers” who don’t really practice devoutly (they drink, buy things on/watch TV on Sabbath,etc). Bcuz....”Choose ye this day whom ye will serve,” which was beaten into me growing up. To be agnostic I quote scripture *a lot* weirdly 

- I fucking love having debates with some believers (it’s happened maybe 3x) but the positions I take have been closer to the side of radical believers because radicals do FAR LESS picking, which is what makes them extreme. 

If I’m an asshole, boy is it therapeutic as FUCK *and* hilarious to be the asshole here.

We don’t really talk anymore but we co parent well and he is polite to me and my boyfriend. He has the kids a LOT because his world revolves around them, and I have allowed it because the kids love him and it would be cruel to try and keep our schedule to every other weekend or something.

This happened yesterday and i am not sure if i am the asshole or just overprotective.

My female roomate which i know since years now told me she lost her bank card and has money troubles over the holidays. She can't get it from the bank since she is at one of those fancy online banks. 


I told her if she needs a bit of cash for food i can lend her some. That's not a problem since i know she is in good financial circumstances and i wouldnt even care about not getting somewhat 20 bucks back. We are pretty chill wg and it pays off over time. I pay this you pay that style.


She told me not to worry about it since she will meet with a guy tomorrow (today) who will buy her old sport-shoes.

Yeah, that caught me kind of offguard.

The dialogue went something like this:




Me: ,,You sell your worn shoes to a stranger? Like... a man... with same shoe size who wants to buy them for...sport..""?

Her: ,,No, i sell used shoes to him since a year now, it's good money and i am fine with it, since he is not harassing or something""

Me: ,,You know this could be just the start of a harassement or future problems right? You dont actually need that money in my opinion. Be careful not to include your adress by shipping it to him.""

Her: ,,I dont know what you are talking about, this is a normal guy who just wants to live his fetish, if i get some extra bucks to spend, we are all happy. And no this time i will hand them over to get the money quicker. I dont care if he got my adress, he seems nice and is not a psycho. Calm down, this is none of your business.""


Me: ,,Should i come with you? I can stay behind if you want to, i dont want you to get into trouble or being harassed.""






She gets louder and the softcore version of what she said is that i should not treat her like a little girl who can't protect herself.
etc. etc. etc.


I wanted to make an argument that she goes into this a bit gullible as she would be immortal and nothing bad could happen to her, but she stopped me mid sentense and that i should shut up.



I am not used to harsh discussions and was a bit stunned. We haven't talked yet and she went to meet this man and then will be at a friends house for newyears eve.


I am hesitating to message her if everything went okay, or if something went wrong.



I am confused. (Non native speaker, excuse my grammar etc.)



Edit: Allright, i like the comments and i like the way you think guys. And you are right, i mean the mixture got me thinking what happened wrong.

First: I want to be clear that i did not use any loud or agressive tone. I am kind of a passive guy. People in my environment know i just want my friends to be safe. Especially when knowing me since years.

I just spoke to her via phone,  if i was too intimidate or not aknowledging she can take care of her own. She told me she had a rough week and was reflecting her emotions at the conversation.  Her emotions got her heated up and she thought i am trying to controll her. (She had trouble with her ex-bf who was telling her what to do all the time).

Thanks for the comments who lead me to apologize to her, we are cool, she told me she knows that if something bad happens or there are problems, she can always ask for help. (as usual)

Fyi: She did not meet him, he canceled the meeting telling her it was awkward to meet her in reallife. I will lend her some money tomorrow. I ...think...that's a good indication? In hindsight of him not being a perv or smth.

Have a nice new years eve guys. Thanks again!

3726,"AITA for seriously hating my step daughter You'll most likely think i am so here's the back story:

Partner and his ex have child together almost 15 years ago. Only child is spoilt rotten, never told no, given everything she wants and waited on hand and foot. Child is a brat from a very young age, never disciplined, never punished for bad/rude behaviour, never called out for her lies or for setting things up so they fight so she benefits.

Fast forward from birth to sd age 11. Partner and ex have split (found out ex cheated and sd isn't even his) and sd is playing the daddy ran away from me card and constantly baiting him into arguments so that he feels bad and buys her what she want. Months after their breakup we meet, hit it off and start dating. Sd is pissed - how dare her dad be with anyone else (mum had someone else before they even broke up but thats ok), how dare her spend time with anyone but her.....really normal shit for a kid after parents split. 

After a few months we move in together and everything is great between us. Sd stays with us and we try to week on/week off with her mum.....sd doesn't like this and wants to be with us full time until we ask her to do something and then she runs off to mum.

Anyway, i am a child of, to a degree, tough love/responsible parents - you make a mess, you clean it up. You fuck up, you face the consequences. Now my sd won't do anything for herself and after 3 years i am over it. She wants slaves and servants not parents. I'm sick of it. I refuse to pick up after her or be dictated to by her. When we ask her to clean her room she is straight on the phone to her mum saying i am mean (it stinks in there and she leaves dirty pads laying around). She gets pissy when her clothes aren't clean but she hasn't actually put them with the dirty washing - again i'm mean. I don't make what she wants for dinner every night- she only wants junk food and because there is no junk i  the cupboard she tells people i don't feed her at all. 

She constantly creates friction within the household. If she doesn't like what we tell her to do, shhe instantly starts with the ""i'm going back to mum"" crap (there is an avo between tne two so she cant actually go there and her mums family wont have her)

Its at a point now where i hate being in her vicinity because shes just causing trouble or creating a mess she expects me to clean up. Shes lazy and filthy and i hate it. I hate her for all the trouble she's caused. 

I know alot of her behaviour is learnt/conditioned from her childhood, but after 3 years she should be able to do something for herself. I am sick of constantly putting her first and she throws it back in my face.

We also put off having our own child so as not to upset her but how is that fair to us.

Am i an arsehole for hating her? Am i an arsehole for wanting her to be an independent person who can actually care for herself? Am i an arsehole for not wanting to be a slave to a 15 year old?

There is so much more to this story but just can't fit it all in","YTA. You have a responsibility to that child. You don’t get the throw your hands on the air and give up. She never got to chose to be brought into that. Your stepdaughter reeks of Borderline personality disorder/complex trauma. Especially attachment trauma. That happens before the age of two. Which is never the child’s fault. You need to find a new therapist. Preferably one who knows trauma and adverse childhood experiences, and attachment theory. You are the adult here. You have to figure out how to give that child the safe secure place she needs and has clearly never had. Get her into dialectical behavior therapy. 

You are failing her, you are continuing to  traumatize her. Understand something not all trauma is abuse, and something may very well traumatize a child that wouldn’t traumatize and adult. You cannot abandon her now. It won’t be productive. Please for the love of god inform yourself and do the right thing. That child doesn’t need to end up dead on the streets. If you continue down this road that is a very real possibility because of the neurobiology of these things. My ex wife did. Tough love doesn’t work. The studies show. This is just bad parenting all around. 

If this gets through to you. I can provide some resources on these things, and what these things. I don’t believe in god, but I pray for that child.

I'm the de facto family photographer and we recently all got together for my niece's first birthday (brother and SIL's daughter). At one point, I gathered everyone together--my parents, my aunts and uncles, my brother and SIL, and my niece--for a collection of photos to commemorate the occasion. 

Later, I was showing my brother the group of photos on my camera and he really liked them. I asked if he had a favorite and he said they all looked great. At this point, SIL was looking over our shoulder and said that she liked pictures 1 and 3, but really hated 4 and 5 because it looked like she had a double chin (she was leaning over to kiss niece on the head and it definitely gives that illusion). 

Well, the problem is that picture number 5 is the only one where my mom looks amazing. My mom is really camera shy and tends to be tense until the very end. It's the only photo where she is smiling and looking like her usual happy, beautiful self. Everyone else looks good and it's only my SIL who is in an unflattering position. So I said I'd think about it, but then later posted that photo on Facebook and got that one printed for my parents' house, as well as to send to my brother. I do a lot of post-processing work and print on my own dime, so it's a lot of work for me.

Well, now my brother says ITA because there were lots of photos that I could have used but I went with one of the ones his wife asked me not to use. Which A) I didn't actually ask her opinion and B) she just looks like she has a little double chin, it's not the end of the world. She's kissing her daughter, it's sweet. But my brother says that it was niece's birthday photo and an important occasion for him and his wife, so SIL's opinion should have been taken into consideration more than usual and that she mattered more than my mom in the pic. 

If it matters, we all only get together a few times a year because we all live in different places so it's not like we get the chance for large family photos a lot.","Why didn’t you just print one photo to send to them and one to send to your parents?

3735,"AITA for not wanting my fiancée to wear jewelry from her first wedding on our wedding day? My fiancee and I have known each other for 14 years, almost half of our lives really. We dated on and off in between those years. I never stopped loving her.

When she was 24, she got married to her boyfriend of 1 year, this great guy who she seemed to be really in love with. Of course, I was devastated, because I always thought she’d end up with me. Nevertheless she invited me to the wedding as a close friend, and I attended. The wedding was a small, intimate occasion. She was so emotional during the vows, she was crying all these happy tears. I still remember how she looked at him—like he was the only person in the world. I remember thinking that she used to look at me that way.

The whole day was really bittersweet. I was genuinely happy that she had found love and happiness. It didn’t last, though. They were in a car accident just a month after the wedding, and he died at the scene. She became a widow at just 24.

Then, 2 years later, we rekindled our relationship. We got engaged a couple of months ago and are getting married in the spring. Yesterday I went into her office (where she keeps her wedding “mood board”) for something unrelated, and noticed that she had pinned a cropped picture of her outfit at her first wedding under the headline “jewelry”. She was wearing this diamond necklace with matching earrings.

It really didn’t sit right with me, so I asked her about it. She said that yes, she was planning on wearing that set of jewelry as part of her reception outfit (not ceremony) because it just “looks better with the dress”. I told her that out of ALL the jewelry she owns, why she has to pick the ones that she wore at her first wedding? She gave me the same “it fits better” excuse.

AITA if I put my foot down on this? It just really bothers me knowing that there’s this connection between her first wedding at OUR wedding.

EDIT: She is 29 now, its been 5 years since her first wedding. We started dating 2.5 years ago.","Gentle YTA. I don't think she's wrong to want to wear jewelry from her first wedding to her second one. If she was divorced I'd say that was a little odd, and you might be right to have a problem with it.

3739,"AITA for being civil to my friend's ex? So I (19M) have this group of friends of about 4 of us. We're somewhat close but we all have other friend groups. About 2 or 3 months back a girl in the group (we'll call her Sarah) had a bad breakup with her at the time boyfriend. We had never really met the dude but he seemed chill. However apparently they had a pretty big falling out. We never really got the details but she did mention she felt like he had used her for sex, so after this we obviously took her side and agreed not to really talk to this guy.

&#x200B;

Anyway, since then sometimes I'll be eating at our school's dining hall (we're all college freshmen living in dorms) with some friends, some from the group, and some other people, but not including Sarah, and her ex will just come by and sit with us. I guess he remembers us and feels like he knows us well enough to eat with us, or he's friends with someone else who's currently sitting with us. Even though we never really knew him, I'm okay with him being there. I don't think this guy has many friends and I would feel bad telling him to leave or getting up and moving myself, and in any case I don't really mind since he doesn't talk with us much. I (and anyone else from the group who's there) just sort of tolerate him but never initiate conversations directly with him. Also this has only happened like three times max.

&#x200B;

However, apparently Sarah saw us sitting with him a few times and felt a bit betrayed. She has since asked us to not let him eat around us. I explained that we don't really tell him he can or can't since he just sits down without asking, and flat out telling him he has to move seems unnecessarily rude. Plus it's not like we ever see this guy outside those three or so times.

&#x200B;

I understand where she's coming from, considering it's her ex who we agreed never to be friends with, but at the same time I feel like it's a bit much to ask that we purposefully be a dick to him. The way she sees it, it's what he deserves, but even though we're her friends, we just don't dislike him enough to do that. Maybe because it's been a while since it all happened, or maybe because we never really saw the breakup go down.","YTA

To which I say, maybe we shouldn't be going on holiday if we can't even afford to put a floor on my grandma's room or put new tires on my car? . To explain, she has carpet that is in very bad need of replacing. And my car which I use to run errands for her like pick my siblings up and take them places, groceries, etc. Anyway, I admit my response might have been a bit sharp and maybe even accusatory. To which she just looks annoyed and kind of pissed off. And then we argue a bit me saying she needs a budget and to set priorities and if we can't even put a new floor in my grandma's room then we probably shouldn't be going on holiday and her pretty much just being annoyed at me.

We are not poor, but not super rich or anything, and money has been kinda short due to some of my parents employment downsizing etc.

3748,"AITA for asking for my money back from a skip trip? Throwaway- the characters in this saga know my real account. 

Last year I (25f) bid on, and won, 2 ski lift tickets at a local silent auction. I wanted to take my boyfriend (25m). Unfortunately, we had to wait almost a year-- the ski season was just about over when I won the tickets and neither of us could take off work. But that was ok because they were good for a full year. So we picked a date way in advance, in early January. 

Early January comes and Boyfriend asks me if we want to make it a group outing with some friends. I say yes because we share a lot of friends and it sounds like a good time. So, we reschedule for a day that works for all of us, including our 4 friends. All good. 

I started looking for a new job a few months ago. I finally get the job offer, and, wouldn't you know it-- my start date is the SAME day as our ski trip. I'm bummed, but it's not the end of the world. I tell my boyfriend he can still take the passes and give one to one of his friends. They expire soon so if they don't go this day, unfortunately it'll be a waste. 

Now is where it gets interesting. The lift tickets cost me about $100 at the silent auction. I also owe my boyfriend about $100 for a plane ticket for a wedding we're attending in a few weeks. Since I can't go on the ski trip, I ask him if we can call it even: I won't pay him for the plane tickets and he won't pay for skiing. 

Boyfriend absolutely loses it. Says the trip was clearly unimportant to me because I didn't ask to take off (remember, it's going to be my first day on the job). Then says he shouldn't have to ""pay"" (in the form of me re-paying him for the plane ticket) since he didn't bid on them, I did, and he ""wouldn't have bid on them in the first place if I wasn't going."" 

I thought this was a perfect compromise. Boyfriend still gets to go and enjoy a fun day with our friends and I don't make him lose out on this opportunity just because of my job. And since he gets to go do this, which costs $100, I can be relieved of the $100 I owe him. I really didn't see a problem with just calling it even, but apparently since the tickets were MY idea, I should be the one to bear the cost and that doesn't have anything to do with the money I owe him, so he and a friend get to ski for free on me, and I owe him the money for the plane. 

I feel crazy and I don't know if I'm in the wrong here. I get that they were my idea, but I didn't think it would be too terrible to just ask to call it even? I know he's upset I can't go and I am too...but I can't call off work my first day. Ugh.

I guess this is a bit of a two parter if thats allowed, I work as a front desk/sales/phone answerer at a custom mouldings shop so I spend alot of time interacting with customers one on one and over the phones.

Naturally everyone's sharing life updates, and I brought along a couple of big ones to the table that I didn't know how to share without them possibly being a little jealous.

But it seemed a very important moment on our relationship, where we either figure out how to communicate in heated moments or we begin to reevaluate our relationship. That may sound melodramatic, but it fits.

At around 10pm we mostly made up. I came home from work and she was at a friend's house.

She said she wanted to come home and would begin to sober up from driving. I said she should sleep over if she was too high, I rather she be safe. She insisted she would come home.

At around midnight she said she didn't she would sober up and be spending the night. I told her she should, but I was very frustrated that she chose tonight, of all nights, to smoke so much that she couldn't come home. I pointed out that if I had done the same all hell would break loose.

I asked her who was there and she let me know that her two friends (they're roommates) were there. She also said two of their co-workers. It's only after I pressed the issue that she told me they were male.

It didn't sit well with me. But I told her she had to Uber home if she wanted to maintain the trust I had in her. It's a 40 minute Uber, and at least a solid $60.

I know I'm being insecure, I know I should trust her. And it feels so petty to force the issue, but I didn't see myself being able to maintain the trust if she slept the night there.

I don't even think she was doing anything or had any intention. That's the part that troubles me. I honestly think I may be able to rationalize it. And she could save the money (she may have to Uber back). If she would have done something, I'm probably delaying the inevitable. If she wasn't doing something, I'm probably the asshole. But I don't know how our relationship would progress without my peace of mind.

AITA?","Yta holy crap.  Trust issues much?  YOU TOLD HER to spend the night then you got all high and mighty over males being there, then you pulled a manipulator move and told her some bullshit about her choosing this night of all nights to do this and if you did it then hell would break loose?

3782,"WIBTA if I force a relocation after moving for my wife years earlier? (Very long, tl,dr at bottom) OK so please stay with me this is a very complex situation. My wife and I have been married for 4 years and together for over 8. For a little over 3 years we have lived in NYC which I absolutely hate. It overwhelms me, it is outrageously expensive, and is just hard to live in unless you are one of the mega-rich. We moved to the city to pursue my wife's dream of becoming a professional actor. Initially, the plan was to live here for two years and if she had not accomplished much by that time we would move back home (we are from the southeast). 

During this time I have worked 4 different jobs and slowly made a decent living for us but it has been brutal. When we first moved I had to take a 100% commission job in sales just to get hired.  Seven days a week work because I had to sell or there was no money. Needless to say we blew through what savings we had pretty quickly, most of which was from selling my car to afford the first couple of months rent. After the sales job I worked for a restaurant start up for a year, then broke in to healthcare management, and now manage a clinic. I have a good employer at this point, and our finances are at long last somewhat stable (been there 8 months). 

My wife has made consistent progress in becoming an actor and trying to join one of the acting unions. She had to start with choir and ensemble roles, but over the time we have spent here she has worked and worked and made it in to principal roles and paid contracts. Now, when I say paid I mean technically they get a check but it is criminal what these theatre companies are able to get away with (we are talking like $200/week). I am extremely proud of her, and I have zero doubts that she isn't always doing her best to make something happen. I love my wife dearly and I know she loves me.

That said, I have always been the one that has to pay all of our bills. Rent, Internet, Phone, Electric I pay 100% every month and buy most of our groceries. I have very little residual income at the end of each month after bills though fortunately at this point I do have some going in to a 401k. I was already starting to burn out and then a real life change occured....

My father passed away unexpectedly last spring. We knew he wasn't in great health, but this was a shock. I got the call one morning and he was just gone. I loved my dad, he was a tremendous man who made sure I had good opportunities and was always around for me as I grew up. I was so fortunate to have a father that truly cared. I say that because this was a soul-crushing blow to me and has completely shaken me to my core and I still feel it every day.

Before his death, I had the resolve from knowing that even though I didn't like living in NYC my wife loves it and that I am being a good spouse for giving her the opportunity to pursue her dream. But now I can't handle it. I have panic attacks all the time, I have been going to a psychologist since November and have had no significant breakthroughs. I feel depressed all the time. I am trying to see a psychiatrist but finding one that takes our insurance has been tough. I have a very hard time completing even basic functions, and I know that my mom and brother are struggling. 

I want to move back south asap and get closer to our family. I want to start preparing for my wife and I's life together and  getting to a place where I can deal with this grief. We speak about it all the time and I know she doesn't want to leave NYC. She will but her conditions have been that I have to have a job lined up before we can, and she only really is OK with moving to Atlanta, Georgia (we are not from Georgia) because there is a market for her work there. I am torn because part of me thinks that my health should 100% be a drop everything and lets get you right sort of scenario for her but it doesn't seem to be all of the time. Then I am also torn because I feel I should be stronger and able to handle these things so that she can keep working on what she wants whether it be in NYC or elsewhere. I think my mental stability has about 6 months tops left in the city before I really break.

So I guess all of that is to ask this question. Would I be the asshole if I, after a reasonable effort is spent, relocate us back south after devoting 3.5 years of my life to helping her with her goal of being an NYC actor?

Thank you to anyone kind enough to read through that wall of text.

tl,dr

I relocated to NYC for my wife a little over 3 years ago to support her in her dream of being a professional actor. I hate living there, she loves it. I am the breadwinner and pay 100% of our bills, but she has made progress in establishing her career. My father passed away last spring and now my mental health has gone to s**t with the grief making the anxiety I have from living in the city, on top of the sheer grief itself, even worse. She doesn't want to leave but will concede to relocating to ATL, GA as there is a market there for her work. I just want to get close to home. Would I be the asshole if I, after a reasonable effort is spent, relocate us back south after devoting 3.5 years of my life to helping her with her goal of being an NYC actor?

3790,"WIBTA if I confronted my family about a conversation they had with my girlfriend? Some backstory to get started:

Long story short, I was a terror of a kid growing up. From age 5 to 18, I terrorized my family emotionally, mentally, and in the case of my brothers (who are about my age), physically. My older sisters grew up with our mother and abusive father. These two factors have had my sisters (currently 31 and 32) and my mother always fearing what I might become when I became an adult.

&#x200B;

I'm happy to say that since 18 (I turn 21 this fall),I've made strong strides from becoming a more violent version of my father. My temper is in check, and my relationships with my family, friends, etc. have all improved dramatically as a result.

&#x200B;

Enter my girlfriend (19F). We've been together almost 3 years, that means she and I started dating around the time I was making my turnaround. Some of my toxic tendencies bled over into the beginning of the relationship, such as unwarranted levels of yelling, mild to moderate insults, etc, but she's helped me to learn to control this. I've NEVER laid my hands on her though, just to be clear.

&#x200B;

I started bringing my girlfriend around the family last fall, exactly 2 years after we started dating. She's since become friendly with my family, and they all have high opinions of her but just to be clear they aren't particularly close. The only one that talks to my girlfriend outside of family events and whatnot is my mother.

&#x200B;

Cue today, it's family dinner. I'm in the living room with my brothers. My girlfriend is with my mom, my sisters, and my sister's boyfriend. The topic turns to me and they all start talking about the massive changes and improvements I've made in the last few years. My oldest sister then turns to my girlfriend and asks her questions like ""Does Josh ever scream at you?"" My girlfriend lied, as we have our shouting matches from time to time but didn't want to share that. They pressed her about it, saying ""You don't have to lie, it's okay."" My girlfriend stood her ground, as she felt that our issues aren't their business if we don't feel comfortable sharing.

&#x200B;

I found out about this an hour ago (they left at 8pm and it's 12am now). I told her she could've been honest but I appreciate why she did what she did. However, I'm pissed that they felt inclined to ask and press my girlfriend about this. I understand why they'd worry given the backstory I shared, but I feel that this wasn't their business and they crossed a line. They should've asked me directly considering they aren't THAT close to my girlfriend and I'm their brother/son. I've also never given them a reason to think I'm abusive to her.

&#x200B;

I want to confront them about this and establish boundaries and explain that this was wrong of them despite the past. My girlfriend believes that while it was uncomfortable, doing this would result in damaging the growing relationship she has with my sisters and mother.

We have very different views on things that spark many arguments. Some of them have even made her cry. There's also been times where she gets sad for no reason or won't even tell me why she's upset in the first place. I've comforted her many times but lately I haven't been doing it as often. It stresses me out a lot and most the time it doesn't even make her feel any better.

I am 23 (f) and my cousins are 11 and 9 year old boys. 

They like play fighting with each other, their mom Helen allows it, and they think it's really cool I do krav maga. 

So they keep wanting to ""play"" with me and have me teach them some stuff. Which I think is a bad idea for a few reasons

- I'm not a qualified instructor, I'm honestly pretty new at the sport having only done it for a year

- unlike a lot of martial arts, it doesn't have things that are not allowed because they're unsportsmanlike. We actually learn stuff like kicking someone in the balls hard, going for weak spots like eyes, etc. Not a good thing to teach kids who like to play at it

- you need equipment, and training throwing punches bare handed or with bad form is gonna get you hurt

- it's not something I've ever seen kids do, a kids karate class would probably be more appropriate

But the kids won't stop hounding me to play, the younger boy puts me in headlocks that I don't try and fight out of (because the way I've learned is to tuck a chin & shoulder to get some breathing room, grab the other's jaw, wrench it back, and hammer on their throat till they fall.. which is obviously excessive there)

The kids keep trying to play fight though and their mom keeps asking if I won't just teach them a few things, entertain them a little. I keep saying no, for the reasons I said here. She gets annoyed with me over it saying it's not a big deal, she's sure there's something simple I could show them

Like I did a DNA test and found out I'm 3% Persian, 50% Mediterranean, and like 45% northern European. I'm super white. I have just had kinky, thick, curly hair for my entire life. It sucked for me with 2 sisters with dead straight hair and a mom with smooth waves.

Background in a spoiler tag. >! I am watching mixed-ish. There was an episode on natural curly hair versus straightened hair. I saw it and did some research on 80's hair and felt really good about the fact that it wasn't just my white ass that was told as a child how dirty my hair looked. Or that in interviews for positions was told that ""a professional appearance"" was required. Hell I worked at McDonalds as a kid and a corporate representative told my manager staff and myself that my hair didn't look clean enough and was off putting. Or as a child how adults in my life would tell me how bad they felt for me, for having such terrible hair.!< 

I didn't mention any of that in the post though. I just said ""I'm watching mixed-ish and being really grateful for the proud women of color that paved the way for me to where my natural hair in a professional capacity.""

A lot of people came out of the woodwork to call me racist and stupid. I tried explaining that I appreciated the work they put in that resulted in an easier life for me. They just said I'm stupid, and racist.

AITA for trying to appreciate the work that bettered my experience and destigmatized my hair?



But I also feel that some people are being unduly dismissive of the people of color that put their livelihoods o  the line. Feminists didn't do shit for people with natural hair. The people that initiated the changed were people that struggled and were punished for natural hair like mine. Those people in the worst situation imaginable chose to make a change instead of feel bad and cry. People of color that were proud of who they are, willing to stand up to the institutionalized racism, and prove that their hair is just as good, solid not better. Those people are heroes that risked their jobs, and often entire communities that had previously accepted them. They made a change with blood, sweat, and tears that benefitted my white ass. 

They didn't do it for me, but the work they did allowed me to be me, and allowed me to use my power to make the world a better place. I won't give some other movement the credit just because they weren't thinking of me. I will not erase the overall benefit from their incredibly hard work, just because I am white. 

As some one told me in a private message ""You don't have to be food to appreciate the work Willis Carrier did for the ac""","> ""I'm watching mixed-ish and being really grateful for the proud women of color that paved the way for me to where my natural hair in a professional capacity.""

My sister on the other hand........is PISSED at me, I feel a bit bad but we do it every week and I wanted to hang out with friends and not 2 kids. She said she's ""done with me"" which means like 2 or 3 days and then realizes that she misses me lol. I wouldn't mind rescheduling where I do something with her to make it up.

My brother was happy we didn't do movie night either cause he wanted to play with his new toy or some shit.

I get where my sister is coming from, I am a senior and I'm going into the armed forces so I won't be around for probably a year going into training and such, but I wantto spend time with my friends cause I most likely won't see them again, while ill still see my sister for my life.

I was having a really good day today and when I was coming back from Fry's I found basically this note on my door (I would link a pic if needed):

3807,"AITA for asking my mom to stop buying gifts for my girlfriend? My girlfriend and her mom have a weird relationship. Her mom isn’t very supportive of her and makes her feel worse when she’s already down. For example, my girlfriend has a chronic illness and it flared up during our anniversary weekend, when we were staying at my parents’ before we went into the city to celebrate. When my girlfriend texted her mom, her mom said “Great, now you’re a burden on his parents”, even though my parents weren’t taking care of her and didn’t mind, in fact they were worried. Overall, just not the best mother.

One other thing she does, is not ever really buy my girlfriend gifts or celebrate her accomplishments. My girlfriend doesn’t feel entitled to them, but even just a card acknowledging her birthday sometimes would be appreciated. My girlfriend does theatre and her mom never gets her flowers or cards or anything to celebrate that, if she even shows up to the performances at all. It makes my girlfriend sad, because she feels like her mom doesn’t give a shit. She’s tried talking to her about it, but her mom makes excuses.

The thing is, my mom is very supportive, which is sweet. She’ll show up to every show my girlfriend is in, which is great. But she ends up going over the top, buying her flowers and gifts. My girlfriend is appreciative, but then gets upset saying “Your mom is so much nicer to me than my own mom, why can’t she be like that?”

It all sort of came to a head recently. I knew that my girlfriend’s mom was coming to my girlfriend’s summer performance and that she was giving her a coupon for clothes shopping, which I knew that would make my girlfriend upset. So, I asked my mom to not make a big deal of it and to not get my girlfriend flowers or anything fancy. It was just going to upstage her mom, then upset her and make her go into a tailspin about how her mom sucks, and how my mom loves her more. My mom showed up to the performance with a bouquet of flowers, a pair of earrings and a card. Low and behold, after the performance, I had to hear the same thing. My mom loves her more. Why is her mom so uncaring, why can’t she give her gifts and a card? The same thing, same cycle.

So, I was upset with my mom and my mom thinks it’s ridiculous that I am upset with her. She thinks I should be grateful that I’m so good with her girlfriend. I am, but I am just tired of seeing my girlfriend so upset. Am I being an ass here?","YTA. I think you're misinterpreting this. The fact that your girlfriend gets emotional because your mom is so much nicer than hers doesn't mean your mom is ""upsetting her"" by buying her gifts. It sounds like your girlfriend really appreciates it, and is moved by it. 

Your girlfriend is upset because her mother is unkind, not because your mother is kind. It's okay for her to be upset about that. It's not your job to prevent her from having those feelings, but to be a comfort to her. 

Your mother's right, you should be grateful that she's so good to your girlfriend. It's very sweet and generous. It's up to your girlfriend to speak up if she actually doesn't want gifts.",1,YTA,1.0,0.0,0

I went across the street to a well known pharmacy to buy a cheap one for the stay. They cost $25!

He games all day, drinks tea/sweets, and does eat somewhat healthy (veggies, meat, etc.) but I think it's mainly his portion control/inactivity. I have no problem with his weight; I love him the way he is, but I think I may have been lacking the....tactful approach to bringing up my concerns and mentioning his weight/telling him I love him the way he is. I'm basically probably showing the complete opposite.

&#x200B;

My BF thinks I mention his weight/lifestyle only because I ""want him to be skinny"". Like...hello??? I'm literally in a relationship with you. I still get turned on by him, and thinking about him as a whole makes me giddy. But he feels unloved just because I mention his weight...An important detail to mention is my BF has heart problems/blood disease/CFS/depression. I truly think exercise would help him feel better. It would also help him in every day life; I can't imagine the toll his heart is taking. I'm worried that most of his symptoms/health issues are caused by his sedentary lifestyle. He told me ""my doctors say I'm in good condition"" and ""exercise wouldn't help me"" but come on...not even walking??? And his doctors can't be saying that. ((He's about 6'1 and over 235 lbs.))

The particular situation that makes me write this post is when my BF bought some clothes. He was showing me t-shirts, and I simply said ""they're awesome but you wouldn't pull them off very well, since you don't have many clothes to match"". The shirts were really dark/emo BTW. He thought I was making it about his weight and got upset. Then he said ""it's hard finding jeans I like because of my size...mainly my waist."" My BF has a droopy pot belly (nothing wrong w/ that, I've given his lower area lots of affection lol), so I told him ""it's probably your stomach making your waist size big"".

3816,"WIBTA for reporting my bosses to HR? As a background, I work as a senior accountant and I generally work together with junior accountants on projects. Our company just announced the people who will be promoted, and I was informed before-hand that I will not be promoted this year as the bosses wanted me to work on my weaknesses (like project management, etc.) before promoting me as a manager, kinda sucks but I can accept that result at the time.

One of the new-hires just came finished his probation period, and it is customary for managers to give a 1 to 1 talk to the new juniors to give them feedback on their performance, and all that. Last night, I received a text from my friend who is a co-senior of mine, and apparently, the new junior told him that during the confirmation talks, 80% of the conversation were revolving around my co-senior and I “being too negative” and “don’t get too absorbed with them” (probably telling him to hangout less with us on lunch or something, idk). 

I will admit, I do like to complain about work in general (most ppl in the office do, including the manager, since he complains the most), and perhaps I do say mean things about my boss (I can’t really recall what I said, but never had I ever say to my juniors not to cooperate with my boss). Hence, I was a bit shocked that my manager would give such a feedback behind my back, especially since he never tells me directly to cease such behavior.

On first instinct, I wanted to report such a behavior to HR, on the basis that my manager is creating discord within the team. However, my co-senior wanted to escalate it to the director first prior to speaking with HR to try to resolve the issue internally. 

When my co-senior had his conversation with the director (I wasn’t involved in the conversation as I would like to observe from a distance for now), it appears that the director is trying to defend his manager’s behavior, but he would like to hear more about this issue with the manager being present next week).

The question is, WIBTA if I still report my manager to HR regardless of the outcome next Tuesday and &  for me to request HR to relook into my promotional status given that the feedback from my manager may be tainted.","Do you honestly think that when you openly shit talk people, they won't hear about it?

We both took a fixed amount of spending money, which we spent, and in the airport I had ¥1000 (£7.71, $9.44) and he had ¥800. We both planned to buy some sweets or food in duty free to take back to share around at our offices. Looking around we couldn't find much within our budgets that would work for an office worth of people. We were both fine with this, bringing food offices after holidays isn't a requirement, its just something we thought could be nice.

In the mean time, he found a small toy of a Ghibli character he liked for ¥800, I pointed to a bigger one for ¥1800 and offered to give him the extra ¥1000 for it. He was super happy with this and right now the toy is sitting proudly on our bed.

We walk to the gate, and as I pull out my phone I find an extra ¥1000 note that I must have missed earlier. There is a tiny shop right next to the gate, so I look through and there are boxed of 26 chocolates for ¥303, I buy three boxes in different flavours. I got back to him, let him know that I'd bought some chocolates, and they had more, he replied that he's all out of money so can't do anymore shopping.

So we fly back to England, and spend a few days recovering from jet-lag over the weekend. On the Monday (which is a bank holiday) I start getting stuff ready for work on Tuesday, and I put the chocolates in the fridge, because its warm. He spots them and says that because I have three boxes and they each have 26 chocolates he would like one to bring to his office, I said yes and asked him to let me decide which box he could have. I took a bath and thought about it, and then I went back to him and said that I don't really want him to take in any of the boxes to his office, because I bought them for my office.

Right now he is upset that he won't have anything to bring in, I pointed out to him that yesterday he was fine with not bringing anything for his colleagues, and he said that was because yesterday he didn't have any other options.

Am I the arsehole for not letting him take in one of the boxes of chocolates?

I'm always catching his bus. But one day he sees me running toward the bus stop, I'm 10 feet away, but he doesn't stop for me. I chase him a couple hundred yards to the next stop light, and he still doesn't stop for me. Other drivers have, but not him. Saw me, deliberately left me stranded. Up until that day I had been personable beyond a strictly professional driver-passenger relationship with him, but from that day on I decided no more jokes and smiles, I'm just gonna get on, pay my money, and get off at my stop.

I keep this up for a few months until yesterday. I get on, pay my money, no gibes, no gambols, no songs. Then during the ride he asks a favor of me. He asks me to wake up one of the sleeping passengers because he might miss his stop. I do it, not even thinking that I'm doing my sworn enemy a favor. I'm doing the sleeping guy a favor. I wake him up. We both see if he's missed his stop yet. He says ""No, this isn't my stop yet, but thank you."" Eventually we reach his stop and he gets off.

I’ve known her for 11 years and we are very close. At first the fainting was obviously kinda alarming but now we know we just need to help catch her and there’s nothing you can do but put her in the recovery position and wait it out. 

When this happened, we hadn’t been out for too long, we were at the mall, and I had driven us there. We had just got out the car into an underground car park when she dropped, and a guy who was walking past shot over to her to catch her. 

It creeped me out how quickly he had moved in on her and so I yelled at him thinking he hadn’t seen me because I was still getting around the car to her side. There are these huge concrete pillars that I need to navigate around and it was a squeeze to get round them. He ignored me and caught her and when I got to the otherside of the car he had laid her in the recovery and was feeling her pulse.

My side: I know it's weird, but I hate overhead lighting, fluorescent in particular. I feel like hate is not even a strong enough word. When that kitchen light is on it causes fight-or-flight in me. I want to get away from it, but it's permeating everything. If I go in the bedroom and close the door I can see it coming through the cracks and it feels like it's seeping into my brain. The only analogy I can think of is a stink bomb. I become anxious and unhappy until it goes away. Sure I have to deal with fluorescent at work during the day, but I'm anxious enough outside the house. I don't want to live that way in my home at night. I'm happy to buy and maintain as many table and floor lamps are necessary to produce adequate light. I know I'm not the one who cooks, but honestly if it were a choice between the light or takeout, I'd prefer the latter. I think my boyfriend should accept my preference and not use that light while I'm home. If I lived alone it would go completely unused, I have no issue doing the dishes or using the kitchen with just the other lights we have. I think it's unreasonable of him to subject me to this discomfort.

His side: he does the cooking and most of the dish-washing (I work full time and he doesn't, and that's part of our division of labor.) He cannot see as well when the overhead light is off. Aside from that, he enjoys the lights. Any more table lamps in the kitchen would not be feasible. If he were living alone he would not use any other light for the kitchen/living room area, he'd leave it on all the time. He thinks it's unreasonable of me to insist that he cook and clean ""in the dark.""

So what do you think? Who's the asshole here?

EDIT/INFO: I could totally deal with this by spending time in the bedroom while he cooks/cleans. It would be fine for me if he used the light while I was not in the living room/kitchen. But if I go to the bedroom and close the door when I get home he says I'm being silly and gets sad that I'm not spending time with him, then I say ""well it's because the scary light is on"" and he makes faces at me. But that stuff is more for a relationships sub. I just wanted to clarify I am ok with him using it while I'm home, just not while I'm in that half of the home.

3826,"AITA for not telling my fiancée about my past? So a little background info here. Between the ages of 13-17, I was a pretty shitty teen who got into a lot of trouble. From smoking weed, underage drinking, skipping school, getting into fights, and stealing my neighbor's car for a joyride. I ended up in juvie at 16 and didn't really start to change my life around until a year later when my mom passed away. That will always be one of my greatest regrets, but this post isn't about that.

After completing several programs and doing a ton of community service, I was able to get my records sealed at 18 and get a fresh start in life. I got my GED, went to college, got a job that I've been at for 9 years now and am currently in an upper management role. My life has taken a complete 180. I'm a law-abiding citizen. I bought a house a couple years ago, my student loans and both my cars are paid off. I don't ever look back at the past, just focus on what's ahead. I have even completely avoided people from my past, especially those I know never grew up from that teenager phase.

I recently got engaged to a woman I had dated for 2 years. While I've shared many things about my life with her, I've never talked about my past as a juvenile delinquent. I just never thought it was important enough to bring up or that it would have any meaning in our relationship. I'm 33 now, so everything happened 16 years ago. I've made big changes in my life, and who I was as a teenager literally has nothing to do with who I am now as an adult.

When my fiancée posted our engagement photos on her social media, one of her online friends from a group pointed out that she knew me. This sparked a private conversation between my fiancée and her, where my fiancée learned that this woman used to party with me as well as buy weed from me back in high school. The woman also mentioned I went to juvie and she never saw me again, so she was curious about how I was doing. Obviously this was all news to my fiancée, who immediately texted me and said we needed to talk when I got home.

Well I've been home for a couple hours now, and my ""talk"" with my fiancée has consisted of her ranting at me for 45 minutes. She feels like I was trying to hide my past from her, doesn't understand why I never mentioned it to her, feels like I'm hiding other things about myself, etc. She's angry and embarrassed that she had to find all this out from an online acquaintance and not directly from the source. I have not apologized to my fiancée, because I don't feel that I have anything to be sorry for. My years as a teenager are not relevant to my current way of living, and it wasn't something I felt needed to be shared nor do I feel I should be judged for my idiocy back then.

After we landed in New Delhi, I realized I couldn't find my passport. They would not let me board the Tokyo plane without it. She couldn't go without me because the hotel reservations were in my name. Neither of us could exit the airport because we had no Indian visas. We told the police about the situation and, long story short, they got us on a flight back to our home country.

So that is how I ruined my girlfriend's birthday. We have nothing to do for the next two weeks.

Now she is angry at me. In my defence:

* I did not lose the passport on purpose.
* I have done everything I can to make the situation better. I even offered to book a last-minute trip somewhere closer where I could go with my ID card. Switzerland? Italy? Turkey? Nope, she's ""too depressed now"" to enjoy those places after what happened. (Not trying to disrespect her feelings with that. It's just what she said.)

3836,"AITA for leaving a restaurant without paying my bill? There was a post here a couple of days ago that made me think about an event a while ago. 

There was a new all you can eat Japanese restaurant opening in our city and I decided to go with a friend on what I think was the 5th day of their opening week. 
Their formula was that you have a maximum of 10 rounds in which you order something (so not really all you can eat...) and it gets delivered to your table. 
I was a bit disappointed from the start but the options looked good so we placed the first round of orders and waited for that. 

It took half an hour for each of our single bite dishes to come. Granted, the restaurant was almost full, but the kitchen was open and we could see that there was plenty of staff working there, and we were just apologized to for the delay, so I'm not sure what caused it.

No biggie, food was pretty okay, ordered a second round. This time, it took almost 45 minutes for our orders to arrive. Remember, we were with just two, and we ordered a plate with 3 sushi on it and a portion of edamama (cooked soy beans with salt). 
At this point, I'm getting pretty hangry since I saved a lot of place for food and I'm getting impatient. Food is still good, we place a third order. 

No one comes at our table for over an hour. We talk with other people in the place who are also waiting for their orders, even drinks are coming in slow. There were 3 waiters walking around talking to people and we get an another apology but no explanation. 
Our orders were 2 bites of sushi each, and at this point I was fed up with waiting and told my friend if there's no food in 20 minutes, I'm walking out without paying. 

We ended up waiting 30 minutes at the insistence of my friend, but still no food. We left then, went somewhere else, finally had food. 

I've never walked out of a restaurant before, but I think I was justified at this point. Kitchen was still fully equipped, from my guess it was the order system that had something going wrong with it, but waiting three hours for our third round of small bites it just terrible service imo. 

I read reviews of this place the weeks after and it seemed that this kept repeating. A year later and they're still in business and doing better (my brother lastly visited them), but I've been wondering for some time if what I did was wrong?

3838,"AITA for telling off a student assistant in my department? Throwaway account as posts on my main account could reveal who I am.

I [M41] am the director of a production department at a tv station. I have around 70 people working directly under me, two of whom are student assistants (a guy and a girl, both 22). They are both very bright and creative and work exceptionally well together. I often let them work on their own projects instead of actually ""assisting"" the full-time employees with their jobs, because they tend to come up with great ideas and concepts that end up being very useful for our department. They're good kids but both completely lack respect of authority. They're never rude or anything like that -- but being jokesters both of them, they treat their superiors with the same amount of humor and (dis)respect as they would treat each other.

I'm friendly with both of them and occasionally joke around with them but no more than that.

Now, I just had my first baby with my girlfriend and the first day after I came back from my two weeks of paternity leave, the two of them had placed a gift and a card on my desk. The gift was a badminton shuttlecock with the name ""Lee Chong Wei"" (famous badminton player) signed onto it (obviously by one of them). The card said something along the lines of ""Dear wilan12345, congratulations on becoming a father. We are so happy for you and because we know how big of a tennis fan you are, we got this original signed tennis ball off eBay for you. Hope you like it."". I AM in fact an avid tennis fan, and they have more than once joked around with me saying that ""tennis and badminton are pretty much the same sports, right?"" (which I never found funny) but this -- treating me having a child as a chance for them to disrespect me and my passion -- was just more than what I was interested in tolerating from two student assistants. I got pretty pissed, called the girl (who was at her desk at the time, the guy wasn't) into my office and told her that I really wasn't appreciating them messing around with me, their superior... she looked a little upset and apologized and left my office.

Afterwards, I saw that they in the meantime had put an actual gift (a pair of baby sized tennis shoes) and another, nice, card saying ""Congratulations on your little tennis player."" by my office.

Now a colleague of mine, a director of a different department, is calling me an asshole for telling the student assistant off for trying to congratulate me. I of course wish I had seen their actual gift before I told hers off, but in the end, I solved a problem (them being disrespectful to their superiors) that had bothered me for a while, so I really don't see the problem.

3839,"WIBTA if I told my sister-in-law that no one wants to see a 30 minute slideshow of her kids? My sister-in-law has two kids (son and daughter) who are 4 and 6 and she LOVES to take pictures of them and share the photos with everyone. She also loves to throw large birthday parties for her kids, and she’ll get upset if you don’t make it, because she feels that these are very important family functions. Ok fine.

Every year for each of their birthdays, she’ll put together a slide show of photos with music that usually runs about 20 minutes long. She invites the entire family over for their birthday celebrations, and after everyone arrives she has everyone sit down in front of the tv, and watch a slideshow that consists of only pictures of either son or daughter (depending on whose birthday it is of course.) Each year they have usually ran around 15-20 minutes, but last year each slideshow was almost 30 minutes long. Most of the family has gotten visibly and vocally irritated at this point; I.e. rolling their eyes when she announces the slideshow is going to start, taking bets for how long they think it will be, making “shoot me now” gestures, or just simply saying “oh for fuck sake this again?” And etc. Last year a couple family members just got up and left after she announced the slideshow. Sister-in-law seems to be either completely oblivious to how others feel or is just completely inconsiderate. I would like to think that she’s not the latter, but I feel like she needs to know that almost no one enjoys/wants to watch 30 minute videos of her children.

3844,"AITA for being upset that my bridesmaid scheduled her wedding during my honeymoon? I got engaged last year (May 2018) to a wonderful, goofy man. A couple months later, we were picking who would be in the bridal party. One of the girls I picked to be a bridesmaid is a really good mutual friend of mine and my fiancé. She’s been awesome helping with the invitations and even took some beautiful engagement photos as her wedding present to us. 

&#x200B;

She’s been a wedding photographer on the side for several years now but has been having some job trouble, so money is a little tight. I ended up buying her bridesmaid dress for her because I didn’t want being in my wedding to add to her financial stress. 

&#x200B;

My wedding is at the end of next month (July 2019), and a few days later, my fiancé and I are going on a 9 day honeymoon with a cruise that we scheduled in January. 

&#x200B;

Our friend also got engaged almost a month ago (May 2019) and due to her financial issues has decided that she is also going to get married this summer. She told me she was thinking about early July, which would be 2-3 weeks before my wedding. 

&#x200B;

That brings us to today. I got a text from my friend asking when my honeymoon is. I told her when and she said that it’s unfortunate because she’s decided to get married 2 weeks AFTER I do on the day before we get home. She said that she had wanted to ask me to be a bridesmaid but that my honeymoon is more important. 

&#x200B;

This really annoyed me. If it were any other type of vacation then I would have cut it a couple days short to be there at her wedding, but that’s not possible with a cruise. 

&#x200B;

I wish that she hadn’t even told me that she wanted me to be a bridesmaid. She chose a weekend that she knew would probably conflict so both my fiancé and I can’t even go to her wedding. I don’t even care about being a bridesmaid. I just wanted to be there.

3845,"AITA for expecting my housemates to pay for depreciation on my washing machine? I have had two housemates who also happen to be two of my best mates, I've bought a house and they agreed to move in and help me out by paying rent, so technically they're tenants. Their names are David and Paul - for ease of reference.

Paul came into the house with a washing machine and it started having issues and eventually broke. I figured David, not having brought much into the house to share, would buy a washing machine to help pitch in. He made some excuses like the fact that he was engaged and going to be moving out within the year and his fiancée already had a washing machine for when they move in together. Long story short I had to buy a washing machine for myself, which I hadn't budgeted for.

In my calculations, with the length of stay that he was planning on it worked out to be about $50 for the use and depreciation of the machine, so I asked both Paul and David to pay up. Paul had done some plumbing work on the house for free because I didn't like the shower head etc.. So he asked if that could just be factored in and that seemed fair enough. But David came back at me telling me that I was being ridiculous! He said that because it was my house and my washing machine that I would have to use it and let it depreciate anyway - regardless of how much he used it. He flat out refused to pay me! He was the one calling ME selfish and money hungry. He said that he'd told other people about what I was asking him for and they all laughed in his face. He's obviously just putting his own spin on the story and making sure he gets that response.

3847,"AITA for wanting my live-in girlfriend to not talk on the phone in the morning while I'm trying to sleep? I know how things tend to go on this sub. Even though you're supposed to ""describe **both sides in detail**"", most people can't help but let their personal bias bleed through. This post is long because I'm trying really hard to be upfront about my natural biases, but there's a quick **TL;DR** at the bottom if you want the basic, bias-crammed AITA.

I'll (31M) dive right into it: I've been living with my girlfriend (29F) for a year and a half now. We argue here and there like any couple, and have been working on our communication, especially when arguing. 

I'm a light sleeper. She's a heavy sleeper. Always have been. Always will be. She has an earlier sleep schedule than me, so I'm normally still awake for a while at night after she goes to bed, and she's normally awake in the morning while I'm still sleeping. 

At night I put on headphones while watching TV after she goes to bed so I don't wake her. She's now telling me that she never asked me to do that, which is true, but I don't want to run the risk of accidentally waking her.

Normally, when she wakes up before me she's pretty quiet, but she's woken me up before, because it just doesn't occur to her that she's being loud enough to wake me. I don't think it ever crosses her brain, because I think she cannot fathom how someone could be awaken so easily. Meanwhile I'm quiet as a mouse while she's asleep, because I can't fathom how noise *wouldn't* wake her up.

Here comes the asshole part. Last night I went to bed around 3am. (Neither of us have anything to wake up for for a couple of days, so fuck it, I'm staying up and sleeping in.) While she was sleeping, I was my usual mouse-like self. However, this morning she woke up at 8am because she couldn't sleep. I was awoken at 8:30am because she was talking to her friend on the phone. 

In her defense, she was speaking quietly, but what little bass she has in her voice still travels through the wall of our one-bedroom apartment. Although I couldn't hear what she was saying, it sounded like Charlie Brown's parents were talking in the living room just on the other side of the wall by my head. I continued to try to sleep but couldn't. 

For the sake of transparency, at this point I'll admit I did a bit of a dick move. I got up and closed the door somewhat loudly to get the point across that she woke me (I didn't slam it, but it was still loud.) I should have said something, but I was clouded by anger and sleepy head. I laid back down in bed for another ten minutes but she kept talking.

I got up again, accepting my fate of little sleep. She was still on the phone as I got dressed and put the leash on the dog. As I went outside to walk the dog, I heard her say something, but I kept walking out. 

I didn't hear her, assuming she was talking to her friend and not me, but again, I'll be transparent and admit that I left in a bit of a huff. Dick move, but part of us working on our communication is taking a moment to calm down before engaging in the argument. I took some deep breaths as I walked my dog, and prepared to talk to her when I got back.

I walk into the apartment and she's gone. I checked the parking lot and her car was gone too. I check my phone for anything from her, but nothing. This raised my anger again, so I was working on a text that told her off, but realized I should take some time to calm down. 

I deleted my text before I even finished it, browsed Reddit for a couple hours, and calmed down. I still hadn't heard from her, so I decided to break the silence. Here's my text verbatim: ""Mornin' babe! Hope you're having a swell day so far! When ya comin' back? Love you! [cute emojis]""

After another half hour or so she calls me back. She's calm, but says, ""What was going on this morning? I hope you weren't mad for me talking to my friend."" I say, ""Well yes, I was upset that you woke me up so early, but I've calmed down now.""

This triggered her. She starts telling me how she's not going to apologize for talking to her friend. I stay quiet because the only thing coming to my mind is blind anger. She continues telling me how she's not in the wrong. Whenever I tried to defend my position, she would interrupt me with her defense before I could finish. 

More transparency: At this point I'm seething because I'm not being heard, so the third or so time she interrupts me, I hang up on her. (Dick move, I know.) She calls back and I ignore it, then send a text saying, ""I'm mad. I need space.""

She sends me a text back telling me that she's mad too and that I was childish for walking out earlier instead of talking to her. 

This begins a text argument. (So much for space, but it's my fault for engaging.) I wont type out the rest of the argument unless someone has questions about it. It's quite long. The broad strokes are that I told her she's disrespecting my sleep when she's on the phone with her friends. She says she won't be a prisoner in my apartment and she can talk to her friends whenever she wants to.

As I typed this up, we agreed to talk about it later today after I've calmed down. Fair enough. 

I'm bringing this to AITA to find out if I'm really treating her like a prisoner because I expect her to send a text to her friends saying something along the lines of, ""Hey my boyfriend is sleeping. We can text or I can call you in a little bit after he wakes up."" But of course, let me know if I'm being an asshole anywhere else during this tale. If anyone has any questions, I'll be open and honest with my answer because I really want to get to the bottom of this.

**TL;DR:** I'm (31M) a light sleeper, so when my girlfriend (29F) talks with her friends on the phone in the morning, it wakes me up and I get mad.","It sounds to me like she was talking quietly outside of the bedroom during daytime hours. It seems like she has a reasonable expectation to be able to do that, especially when the only reason you are still asleep at that time is because you decided to stay up late for shits and giggles. So I'd say you're the asshole in this case because of how you reacted to something pretty reasonable on her part.

We have been messaging tonight and joking around like we used to and then as I put my phone down to go to the bathroom she picks it up and reads it the messages go like so:

Talking about dates with my girlfriend and how his dates are only with his right hand the he says:

Friend: I have everything apart from a girlfriend in life haha

Me: Meh they don't really live up to the hype

I am just joking I obviously love my girlfriend and she knows that and that's mine and my friends style of jokes and has been for years, she doesn't seem to get this and goes off at me saying I'm slagging her off to my friends and why am I with her if it's not worth it, I could see where she could have got that from but I explained the context and she's having none of it she is now ignoring me and has gone to bed and won't speek to me nicely since.

She follows me around like a puppy and doesn’t want to go anywhere by herself. I’m a very independent person who likes her free time. I don’t have loads of people to talk to so I usually sit down and read or browse through social media or something. My friend thinks this is very boring and keeps on pressuring me to go places with her even though I’ve told her I’m comfortable with my routine. 

I put up with this for a long time but today I just had to say what I thought.  I told her that we just didn’t fit together because I was too introverted and she was too social. With her, I can’t get the time I need to recharge by myself. I’ve been asking her and asking her to try doing things on her own and that following everyone around isn’t the best way to go about things (she downgraded from ap literature to be in english honors with me).

3865,"AITA for throwing away all of my roommates kitchenware and workout supplements This actually happened a couple months ago but I want Reddit’s expert opinion on it. I just finished up my first year at college and overall I didn’t really have any college roommate horror stories. There was one roommate, however, that just simply couldn’t take care of himself. He never washed his dishes, often let his food rot and sit out for hours, and never contributed to any cleaning unless he had to (literally being threatened and fined by Managment).

An example would be regular clean checks our apartment had every week. Each roommate had a certain job to do that we’d switch around, but this guy would deliberately move our names so he could get the easiest job every single week. He then would proceed to lie about it and blame another roommate. The bottom line is, this guy is a total douche. We confronted him about his blatant lying and overall cleaning issues, but he’d go straight back to his ways after a couple weeks. By the end of the semester nobody liked him and honestly we kind of felt bad for this guy who’s 22 and yet so incompetent.

Nonetheless the final clean check came for our apartment and he did an absolute abysmal job. I was leaving the apartment last so I was in charge of keeping everything tidy (essentially doing everyone’s job) and removing any waste left behind. Now we were given sheets of paper that told us directly what to clean etc, and mine stated that if anything was left out, I was allowed to either donate it or throw it away. It’s important to note that certain kitchen cabinets and containers were given to all the roommates so we could store our stuff safely in them without the risk of it being tossed.

I ended up doing the guys entire job over, while also dealing with the masses of trash, kitchenware, and rotten food left behind. It took me the entire day, a job that should’ve taken 2-4 hours at most. I was fed up and disgusted that a human being could be this fucking stupid and self-centered, so I went to his stored containers and took out his workout supplements that he uses. These would be assorted fish oils and other shit like protein and mass gainers which come at hefty prices. I think I ended up throwing away $200 worth of his shit but I just felt so good after. 

I know I’m probably the asshole but thoughts?","YTA - and you could be held liable legally for the cost of them.

My friend and I were talking about going to see Frozen last week.  Neither of us have kids, but we enjoy Disney movies and had been to see the last one together so thought we’d go together again. She said she’d look into times and let me know.   

Now I need to mention that my friend and I don’t live close to each other. I live in a big city and she moved out a few years ago, so we take it in turns to do things in each of our neighbourhoods. She drives to me, I take a train to her. Both journeys are about 40 mins each way. 

Anyway so yesterday she told me that she’d also invited a friend and their child to come along. It annoyed me slightly as I don’t know her friend and could do without having a kid tag along, but I figured the place would be packed with kids anyway so didn’t sweat it. She told me a particular time, and I said it was fine so she said she’d book. 

Well today, she messages me saying that she booked and paid for the tickets online, but it was practically sold out so the only tickets she could get together were in the front row. And I am REALLY pissed. I said to her that we could have just gone on another day, but it was a useless comment as she’d already bought the tickets.  I just really wished she’d asked me first, as we go to the movies together a lot and would never sit there. 

WIBTA to cancel? I’ve already paid her for the tickets, as I did tell her to go ahead and book, but it never occurred to me that she’d book such awful seats.  I really don’t feel like 
- spending money on a train ticket and travelling all that way
- Spending additional money on snacks 
- Sitting in a packed movie theatre 
to then have to ALSO sit and get a sore neck from staring up at the screen. I feel like I could have coped with everything else if we had decent seats. 

So I’m thinking of feeling ‘under the weather’ on the day and just do my own thing. She’s got her other friend to go with so it’s not like I’m abandoning her. And she won’t be out of pocket for the money spent.

Feeding wild animals is dangerous for several reasons. First, you’re teaching them that humans are a convenient source of food. This means they will get more bold, as they already have digging up your neighbors garden. It won’t be as cute when they start going into your trash. Secondly, you’re disrupting the natural ecosystem. Squirrels forage for food to survive and they stow it away for winter. If they learn they will have a year-round source of food from you, they will learn to stop storing food and their offspring will do the same. This will cause them to be less fit and die in the wild more readily as they only know how to get food from humans. In short, don’t feed wild animals.",1,YTA,0.0,0.0,1

When  we met my gf she says she wasn't ready to date so we were just hanging  out. Apparently I don't know what hanging out means because I thought  that meant she just needed time. We were having a lot of fun and we were  basically dating but without the label. Then one night she got too  drunk and she kissed some other guy. I was extremely upset but decided  to forgive her. That guy was her volleyball partner, and they were still  playing a season together. I decided to be fair to her and let her  finish out the season, and I thought she would quit playing with him  after.

She said she'd stop playing with him in all  leagues except for one where they were on a 6v6 league.

Her: Okay...?

Me: Do you still have feelings for me? It’s just that recently we haven’t been talking much, we haven’t met up for weeks, idk I just want to check.

Her: I feel like we’re better off as friends. I honestly really did like you in a relationship way, but I didn’t really feel we were working out and I didn’t really feel a a boyfriend/girlfriend connection was there.

Me: Just to clarify, you used to have feelings for me but because we didn’t really feel close as boyfriend/girlfriend you aren’t willing to try a relationship between us again.

Her: This whole conversation is making me feel really quite uncomfortable, I’ve mentioned how I feel and that should be enough.

B is old and I have had them since I was a child and B was a kitten almost 13 years now. My roommate's cat doesn't get along with mine, mine was neutral towards hers until A started attacking B.

B is declawed and a really calm temperament, but has anxiety with being locked up because of past experiences.

My roommate doesn't really know what to do, but won't try some things, but we have tried associating the cats and we have sprayed cat off on the area, trimming A's claws, blocking the area with towels, and letting her walk free around the house with B.

3898,"AITA for revoking my daughter’s driving privileges for getting bad grades? My oldest daughter turned 16 this spring and got her driver’s license this summer. My wife and I agreed to add her to our insurance policy on the condition that she continues to earn a 3.6 GPA or higher each quarter. Our daughter is a very good student and gets mostly As with the occasional B, so we didn’t think this would be an issue. She doesn’t have a job outside of school, so we expect her to focus on academics and keep her grades up. Our daughter agreed and said this was fair. 

Her first-quarter report card came in the mail last week, and she has a C in two of her classes, honors calculus and AP Chemistry. We asked her about this, and she said she doesn’t know why she isn’t doing well and that they’re just hard classes. We offered to get her a tutor, but she got angry and refused, saying she’s not stupid and doesn’t need one. 

We reminded her of the agreement we made and said since she hasn’t held up her part of the bargain and won’t work with a tutor, she will no longer be allowed to drive my wife’s car. We’ll reevaluate in a few months when her semester grades come in. She’s been mad at us ever since. 

I talked to some of my colleagues about it at work, and they think we’re being too harsh, so I was curious and decided to post here. AITA?","It sounds like this report card should be a big red flag to you that something may be going on in your daughter's life that she's having trouble dealing with. Normally she gets straight As and the occasional B, but suddenly she has two Cs. You may want to work on giving emotional support and trying to unearth what's going on. Maybe the classes are too hard and she's feeling inadequate, maybe she's suffering from depression, maybe there are some unresolved issues happening in her life that make it hard to focus on school, etc. It's important to support someone and work to help them during a time of need like this.

Also, it's generally best to make consequences of bad behavior logical. IE: if you write on the wall, then you need to clean the wall. I don't really see how her car is connected to her grades. Meanwhile, allowing her to have some freedom may help her get back on her feet by showing her that you trust her and acknowledging that she's entering adulthood and can handle more responsibilities while you (her parents) can still serve as a safety net. To me, a logical consequence of bad grades is getting a tutor and getting more emotional support to make sure this isn't a deeper issue. And to me, restricting driving privileges would be a logical consequence of bad driving or missing curfew while driving.

I suffered from depression during high school, and when my parents did things like take away the car or ground me, it honestly made everything worse. What I really needed was support and just some space. I wish that someone had reached out and taken the time to peel back my bad grades to see what was really going on. Maybe your daughter is going through a slump and this isn't a full-on huge issue, but I seriously encourage you to be less punitive and try to reach out to her on her level before it develops into something bigger.",1,YTA,1.0,1.0,0
3901,"AITA for snapping at my boyfriend’s daughter? My boyfriend and I have been dating for a year and a half. He let me know early on that he has a daughter from a previous relationship that he has full custody of (his daughter’s mother is nowhere in the picture and never has been).

We’re both guys (not relevant), and his daughter is 14.

I was introduced to his daughter 6 months into our relationship. She’s never really liked me.

I’d try to be nice to her and talk to her but she never really responded to me.

My boyfriend said that she’s a little shy, and he asked me to be patient with her.

She ignored me for a while and then she started to be very rude. She would make offhanded comments about me, insult me, and told me that I was “using” her dad (?). She made a lot of baseless assumptions that weren’t true.

My boyfriend never took any disciplinary steps. He only ever explained why what she said was inappropriate / mean and that she shouldn’t say things like that, but he’s never asked her to apologize to me and he’s never grounded her.

When I approached my boyfriend about the issue, he said that his daughter was having issues coping with another person (me) being in the equation, as its only really been him and her for a majority of her life. (She sees a therapist for her issues).

I’ve had to put up with the constant insults and accusations for a year. I don’t care that she doesn’t like me, but it was getting tiring.

It happened again last night. I was having dinner with them at my boyfriend’s place and she made another offhanded comment.

I snapped and told her that her dad was likely to abandon her or something if she kept trying to push everyone else away from him and keep him to herself, that he won’t be able to put up with her forever and that she should just get over herself.

She started crying and then she went up to her room. I hadn’t intended to make her cry or anything (and I kinda feel bad for that), but I didn’t know how else to get my point across in a way that she would understand.

I’ve never seen my boyfriend get upset before that moment. He asked what was wrong with me, and told me what I said was uncalled for. I told him that it *wasn’t* because she had been provoking me for a year now. It was bound to happen.

This was probably unnecessary, but it was a heat of the moment, and I told him that her awful behavior was his fault because he does nothing to fix it, and that he should stop sheltering her so much because she really needs to grow up.

He told me that I was being childish and he went upstairs to comfort his daughter. I ended up just going home after that, and he hasn’t responded to any of my texts yet. It’s almost been 24 hours.

My ex called me about 8am saying that our 3 year old son had thrown up (he had been sick on Thursday/Friday as well).  She said that I needed to pick him up and watch him while she took my 6 year old to the party with all the other kids.  I got offended and replied why aren’t you the one that staying home?  Ex responded that she done everything for the party and couldn’t believe I had the audacity to even suggest that.  I don’t deny that she scheduled the party and got the cake, but the cost was always agreed to be 50/50 and if she asked me to do one of those tasks I would have.  I was about to start a spin class so I told her I would call her back afterwards, party because I didn’t want to get into it by just reacting.  According to her I hung up on her.  In all honesty time was short, it was 8am and the party started at 9:50.  The venu was non-refundable.

When I called back she had already decided that she would stay home with our son and I would go to the party.  Since I had also thought about the situation, I explained that I’d be happy to stay with him, but she said no.  She then yelled at me (in front of our 6 year old) about how she shouldn’t have to pay me child support, and that she’s working too much right now so I should have the kids more days on top of the extra days I have (right now it’s a 60/40, but most of the year it’s 50/50). 

I went to the party and afterwards I picked up my 3 year old.  Fast forward to after dinner she asked how or son was doing.  I told her he had thrown up again, but he was in good spirits.  (It’s day 5, so he has to be through this already, RIGHT?!).  I told her if he ate and was normal tomorrow am I was going to send him to daycare.  She then proceeded to tell me he shouldn’t go to day care tomorrow and if I did take him she was going to tell the daycare he was sick today - which either makes me look bad or I have to deal with leaving work to pick him up,  To prevent some reddit hate, I had already decided to keep my son home.

She called and I did not answer and she directly texted me “so then you’ll keep him home”, to which I have not responded.  I can’t think of any response I give that won’t just play into her trying to push me around and be aggressive towards me.  AITA?  I”m hoping to wake up tomorrow with some reddit induced clairvoyance on if I should tell the ex that my son is staying home, or just continue to not engage.

We dated for a few months, and although it was short, I truly was in love with her. She broke up with me two weeks ago because my mental health was spiraling and I was cutting again (which ended up being due to the medications I was on). Needless to say, it was very difficult for me and I felt used and alone.

I was, and to some degree still am upset at her for breaking up with me for such a reason, but I'm doing my best to take it day by day and take the high road in the situation. I blocked her on everything as soon as we gave each other's things back, with the intent on finding myself and healing.

However, one of the friends who went to the party also met her that day. They became good friends (although I do know that she has a crush on her) and she goes on about what their plans are around me. At first I tried to just block it out, put in my headphones, and let things blow over. I gave myself two weeks to see how I felt about them hanging out. The night she broke up with me, my friend texted me ""Hey you're cool with me hanging out with \[ex\] right?"" I didn't respond to it until last Monday, when I came to my conclusion.

I texted her something along the lines of how I gave it some time and I still wasn't comfortable with it, and although I can't force her to stop hanging out, I explained that even if she stopped telling me about her, I would still not be okay with it.

She told me that I was being an asshole for ""making her choose"" people and that if I chose to stop being her friend because of it, so be it because she didn't want to ""pick sides."" My plan is to explain a bit more in depth *why* it makes me uncomfortable (every time I see my friend, it's a reminder of her and it sets me back each time). If she still decides to hang out with her, I think for my own sake (and perhaps frustration) I need to cut her off. She and I have been friends for a couple years now, so it's painful to do this.

So I go in to a speedway to get five dollars in gas, a black & mild, and a slushie like I have at least once a week for the past five years. Everyone in this gas station knows me and my order, I have shown my ID there on multiple occasions to the point were no one cards me anymore. Besides this one lady we'll call her Sarah. She has been there two year and I've had multiple interactions with her most of them being unpleasant. So I know she knows who I am and who old I am.

It's my turn to check out so I ask for $5 on my pump and a 85c black & mild, she ask for an ID, which unfortunately today I did not have tody do to only have a paper ID at the moment. I tell her it's fine and I will just take the gas and the slushie.

After my transaction with her I walk around to the other cashier (which is one of the coolest people there, he has even given/let me use a lighter before) and ask for the black & mild which he agrees to and proceeds to cash me out. Sarah comes over and starts yelling at the both of us, telling me how I had no right to go to her coworker after she had just denied me. I try to explain that I'm 21 years old and how her and this man had seen my ID before, how neither of us had done anything wrong, and how she had no right to yell at either of us.

Upon returning to the store to show her my ID to make sure the guy wasn't fired. She tell me she can't accept a paper ID, which I know is a lie not only because one of the acceptable forms of identification she listed was a government issued ID and my paper ID came from the BMV. But also because multiple speedways in my area including that one has accepted paper IDs from me before.

I explained that to her and she tells me that they don't accept paper IDs or expired IDs (which is funny cause the card ID I had a couple weeks ago expired in March and she personal accepted it). She continued to yell and tell me she found not accept it and she was just going her job.

At this point I was tired of talking and ask for a complaint form. Which she at first told me was on the rack with the applications, They weren't.

Also, we're both adults, living separately.

Reddit has always been a private place for me, and I am a very private person. I told my gf this at the beginning of our relationship, and this was fine. She didnt even ever ask me what my reddit was, despite being quite active on the site herself.

However, I guess she found out from me showing her a meme or something, cause she told me recently she went through all my posts and was ""worried and upset"".

Now that part, rightfully so I suppose. I've made posts about my depression and several of my gf and I's relationship troubles on reddit, either asking advice or seeing how I could better myself for her. I can see how she wouldn't be happy to see those things. However, my reddit has always been anonymous and strictly for me. I've never let anyone else that I know see it, or have access to it, and even told her as such.

As a result, I feel massively violated in terms of privacy, and I told her as such before storming out of her house. (Edit since so many people are up in arms about this. The proper summation is I left angrily to go for a walk outside to calm down. I then returned and talked, but we could not agree so I left for the night.) I don't have many friends or much of a support system, so reddit is my go to for this stuff with the safety that it is anonymous. 

She apologized, and said it was dumb of her and that she did it because she was massively self-conscious about herself, but I don't really think that justifies violating my personal safe space. I feel like a teen girl who just had her diary read.

Diaries are inert places where we can shout our insecurities, depression, hopes and fears into the void,  safely expecting that they are privately tucked away from anyone. 

This is not that.  This is a public forum.  She didn't break into your account, she didn't lie to you, you shared something with her and she was curious and she did something that I could do right now to read your posts..

There was one guy however (he‘s a friend of a friend, not sure why he even brought him along) who didn’t really... understand the point of the organization. He said it‘s not right to segregate children from each other because of their sexuality and there’s no need to send them to different youth centers since every center can essentially do what we do too.

I tried explaining to him that not all youth centers do what we do and that it’s important for young LGBT kids to have safe spaces but he disagreed. At some point I really didn’t feel like arguing or justifying their importance to a random dude anymore so I just said „And what makes you think a straight guy‘s opinion on this subject matters?“

He got super offended, telling me he can comment on whatever he wants to despite being straight and that if the roles were reversed I‘d call him homophobic.

I didn’t think much of it at the time but now I‘m wondering if my reaction was a bit extreme. For the record, I don’t actually believe someone shouldn’t be allowed to state their opinion because of their sexuality but sometimes it might be better to just LISTEN to people from marginalized groups and not add your own two cents, especially when you have no idea what you’re talking about.","YTA you just told someone that their opinion doesn't matter because of their sexual orientation.

3925,"WIBTA if I broke up with my girlfriend over something she did when we were broken up? I have been dating my current girlfriend around 7 months now. She is someone I have known for long before we started dating and do think highly of. She tells me that she loves me and sees me as someone she would like to marry in the future. I do love her back and want the absolute best for her as well, but I cannot seem to shake what she did while we were broken up.

Around the month 4 mark, we broke up for several weeks because I told her that I did not think she was putting the necessary effort into our relationship (something that was a problem from day 1 in my view). This was during a difficult and stressful time in her life (death of a close family member), and she and I struggled to communicate exactly what we were feeling and why I broke up with her as a result. While we were still broken up, she wrote me a love letter telling me exactly how she felt, why she wanted me back in her life, and what she would do to change what had happened in causing us to break up. After reading how she really felt, I told her I was ready to give our relationship a second chance, but she said that she wanted time to fully digest and understand exactly what she had written and my reasons for breaking up with her. I agreed to leave her alone and give her time. The next night, she went to a party, blacked out, and had sex with someone else who she said was a previously good friend that she has now broken contact with.

We talked the next day, and she told me what happened and that she wanted to get back together with me. I was extremely hurt by this, but I took her back as a my girlfriend a few days later because she explained her emotional hurt of me breaking up with her and alcohol at the time getting the better of her. She and I are in an \~short\~ LDR, and I have expressed to her multiple times how much this hurt me and how I do not fully trust her because of what happened.

First off, I am 25 years old. I am a guy, and have been working my ass off daily for as long as I can remember.

It started in highschool where I began working at age 15 part time (about 20 hours a week) 

Saved up and bought a house by the time I turned 18 slightly After graduation. About a month after graduating highschool i took a labour job in an oilfield 12 hours from home that had 12 hour days 24 days on 4 days off. I have been doing these shifts ever since.

I got married 3 years ago, and am currently going through my divorce. According to my wife, I wasn't there enough for her (fair enough) and she is lonely.  In this she wants half of everything including a $5,500 monthly child support payment (our son is 1 year old)

The thing is, she has barely worked. She worked a minimum wage job for our entire relationship and only ever took the minimum hours ever required. I have given up a ton of my life to support not only her but my son, and have been working to death in order to get ahead. The courts in canada dont care and want me to pay her the child support she requested along with half of the value of everything we own, even with her only contributing less than 10% through our relationship. 

I feel I am entitled to a hell of a lot more than half as I have sacrificed a lot more than her, yet the courts in canada are pushing for the child support payments (which I will be happy to pay if I get to see receipts for all spending) and about $1.1M to settle the divorce.

3933,"AITA for contacting my ex-husband’s fiancée to warn her about his severe erectile dysfunction? I am a staunch atheist and very liberal, but I grew up in an extremely conservative, repressive Christian fundamentalist background, much like that of the Duggars (though without quite so many kids). At 19, I married a man at my church, and as was expected, we waited until marriage to have sex. Thus, it was only after we married that I found out my husband suffered **severely** from erectile dysfunction.

Though I had feelings for him and enjoyed his company, this had a dreadful impact on our marriage. We went through a large amount of counseling, both medical and through the church (various marriage groups) and it did little good. In the meantime, I started to grow further and further apart from the church (and Christianity in general) and began developing much different views and opinions from how I was raised. A year and a half into our marriage, we ended up divorcing, and I left the church for good.

After the divorce (which was not too bitter, we both knew the marriage couldn’t last), we parted ways and haven’t spoken in 15 years. I harbor no ill feelings towards my ex; despite us being on complete opposite ends of the religious/political spectrum, I do think he has a good heart. But I can’t state how glad I am to be out of the marriage.

My ex husband remarried a couple years after our divorce, had three kids; and this marriage ended in divorce as well. A couple times a year, just out of sheer curiosity, I check out his Facebook page (we are not friends) just to see where he’s at.

A couple months ago, I checked out his Facebook page and saw that he’s engaged to a young woman in her late 20’s, ten years his junior. She is very religious just as he is, and is posting a lot about their “courtship”, and judging by the big emphasis she puts on “purity” and “chastity”, I would bet that she’s waiting until marriage to sleep with him. Meaning, she probably has no idea about his severe ED (he probably has kept her in the dark as he did me, and it’s probably only gotten worse in the 15 years since).

I thought things over for a little while, and decided to message her. I sent her a message introducing myself as his first wife, and I told her about his severe ED; how I had no idea of it until I married him; and the dreadful impact it had on our marriage. I emphasized how I’m not trying to discourage her from marrying him, but that she has a right to know before going to the altar with him.

She never responded to my message, but I looked at her profile a week ago and saw she changed her relationship status to “single”, and that she and my ex-husband are no longer friends.

&#x200B;

Basically, my ex-boyfriend and I are still in regular contact as we are the only people we really know ***well*** in this city. We are still best friends (probably not after this, though!). I am moving into another apartment by the end of this month (July), and he knows this.

&#x200B;

I don't have that much stuff, just a few boxes and some heavy furniture. Basically, I can't move it by myself, but it can easily be moved with two people and a U-Haul. I will be paying for the U-Haul. When I was organizing my move a few months ago, I asked him if he would be willing to help me move. He enthusiastically agreed to it (""Of course!""), and that was that. We've spoken about this for a while; I've even talked to him about specifics. Everyone in my life knows that he was supposed to help me move. I really cannot emphasize enough how concrete these plans are.

&#x200B;

So, he went on vacation for the first two weeks of July, which was fine and planned. Except he ended up extending his vacation... until some time in August.

&#x200B;

He will now no longer be here when I have to move, and I don't have time to get relatives or friends from out of the city to help me, as everyone is already busy and this is on very short notice. (I am moving next week.) My new roommate is also out of town, which the ex in question knows. That's part of why I asked him in the first place.

&#x200B;

I am busy doing a lot of things at the moment, including finishing packing up my stuff AND finishing my thesis, so it's hard to call around to everyone I know to see if they can fly into this city to help me move. The easiest thing to do is hire movers, but he will not talk about that or help me with the cost. I don't have that much money right now as I am just finishing grad school. He knows this; that is why he agreed to help me in the first place.

&#x200B;

He says it is unreasonable for me to expect that he would help me and follow through on that, that he is a single man and can enjoy his vacation how he likes. He says he has no obligation or responsibility to me because we are not in a relationship anymore. The thing is that... this is true? I know this. **But** he made these promises after we broke up, and we are still good friends!!!

&#x200B;

This situation has gotten so out of hand that a bunch of people are now involved, and I now am starting to think that I am the asshole for expecting him to help me move when he said he would do so. Is it wrong to at least think he should pay for the movers? I feel like I am going crazy. So, reddit, please tell me. AITA?

3935,"AITA for approaching my sister's romantic and sexual education in a way that goes against my stepmother's wishes? As a short description of my (recomposed) family, I (24M) live in a West-European country with my father, my stepmother who's quite a bit younger than him and my (half)sister of now 12 years old.

The crux of the matter is that my stepmother is quite conservative and insists on educating her child her way. My sister and I have always talked a lot, I have the routine of putting her to bed and talk about all kinds of subjects while I get her to sleep by caressing her back. However, as she grew close to teenage years, her body started to change and she became aware of the sexual realities of life, I have started to play a pretty important role in her sexual education through those discussions. This grew pretty organically both because of her curiosity about the subject and apparent comfort with discussing it with me, as it is because the subject is very important to me. My method was always to drop certain concepts in the discussion, leaving it open if she wants to question me further about it, or not if that makes her uncomfortable. Both of us never really mentioned these discussions to my stepmother, for my part because I considered this to be part of her intimacy and that she should have sole control about who she opens up to about the subject of sex and romance.

Problems started when I, to my great regret, slipped in a disagreement with my stepmother and implied there was communication about it with me she was not aware of. She then also discovered that my sister and I walk on each other naked in the bathroom without care. The way my stepmother learnt about this was also not ideal. My sister basically came down naked before her shower to get freshly washed clothes from the laundry. Apparently she answered my stepmother's anger that ""her brother didn't have a problem with it so why should she?"". 

Things escalated fast after that. My stepmother started saying things I think are hurtful and pushing my father to get me out of the house while the previous understanding was that I would stay at least until my graduation. The thing is, the situation is already very tense while I think my stepmother doesn't even suspect the extent of my involvement in my sister's sexual education. 

I don't really know how it could have escalated so fast. My best bet is that she has started to see me as a threat to her daughter, which absolutely is not the intention. I am also sure, after a lot of self-questioning, that there were no indication that my sister lived it that way. Although it is probably not a good idea to play my own jury and that I should ask my sister about it, but I intend to do that once I figure how to do it in a non-invasive or suggestive way. I also suspect factors unknown to me are at play for my stepmother's reaction, but all I can do about it for the moment is admit my own ignorance.","I'm getting a...weird vibe from this. There's absolutely nothing wrong with making sure your little sister has the opportunity to get education her mother is unwilling to provide for her. However, she is still a little young for sex ed and walking in on each other naked in the bathroom is crossing a boundary in my opinion. You are an adult, she is a child.

While waiting by the door, I notice another person waiting in her 20's wearing a shirt that says ""coup d'état"" written on it.  I'm aware of what the phrase means, but my brain went into High School French mode to see if I could come up with a literal translation for the individual words.  état is obvious, but I thought I remembered ""coup"" meaning ""to blow"" so I'm like ""blow the state?  that cant be right.""  Then I ruminated over what else ""blow"" could mean in the context.  I decided on imagining if the state were a lit candle, and someone were to blow it out.  That would be an acceptable analogy for overthrowing a government.  Happy with my conclusion, I gave a quick nod of approval to myself like, ""got it.  makes sense"" and looked back down at my phone.  This entire process happened in my brain, so from the moment I looked up at her shirt to the moment I looked down back at my phone, including the head nod, took less than 3 seconds.

I try to clear up the confusion.  I say, ""I'm sorry, I wasn't doing that.  I was just reading your shirt and trying to translate it.""  She says, ""OOOK.  Yeah, whatever.""  Very sarcastically.  Now I'm pissed.  I can see the misunderstanding, but my reasonable explanation should have cleared that up.  I don't appreciate being cussed out and insulted.

Your explanation wasn’t reasonable.  Not to her.  Who needs to have “coup d’etat” translated?  Everyone knows what it means.  Your “explanation” came off as an excuse for you to stare at her chest.  Of course she was upset.  She shouldn’t have insulted you like that, but your response was way over the top, especially considering that your behavior is what started everything.

3946,"AITA for leaving my buddy with a drunk chick? So over the weekend I went to a destination wedding. During the wedding I was seated with one of my best friends a hot single girl (who is a local) her sister and a couple other couples. Since my buddy is married but his wife wasn't there he decided to wing man for me. He did a great job and after the wedding she is inviting the two of us to a local bar she likes before the post reception after party starts. As a side note I had told her that I was planning to uber to where my new job was starting (which was conveniently only about an hour away) after the party, Which was my actual plan if the hookup fell through for any reason.

&#x200B;

When we get to the bar she immediately starts buying strong ass drink after drink (mind you we had already been drinking at the wedding). So in no time she became completely hammered. She then very loudly (enough so everyone at the bar kinda leaned over to watch/listen to her) while also slurring her words pretty bad says,""So I am going to get an AirBnB and you are going to join me. You aren't going to x-town tonight! You just have to pinky promise that you know this isn't a guarantee that I am going to fuck you!""

&#x200B;

So when she goes to the bathroom I put some cash on the counter for the tab and tell my body that I am taking off. She is just way to drunk and even if I didn't have sex with her I doubt she would remember the night and if we woke up in the same AirBnB she might assume the worst. And I did not want to deal with that shit right before I started my new job. I also figured that he could just take her with him to the after party and hand her off to someone that she knows.

&#x200B;

Well turns out that nobody outside the bride knew her, and it also turned out she wasn't as much of a local as we thought and in fact lived almost 2 hours away. They didn't trust just dumping her into someone random uber (nor did they want to pay for that I am sure) and the bride didn't want to deal with her on her wedding night so they asked my buddy to take her with him to his AirBnB and just have her sleep on the couch. Well on top of all that apparently he really skimped on the AirBnB since it was just going to be him for the night and the place he stayed only allowed him access to the kitchen and the living room which had a futon and the bathroom. He spent the entire night sleeping on the hardwood floor.

&#x200B;

He blames me for the whole thing and is calling me an asshole for ditching him. But neither of us knew how it was going to turn out and even if I did stay the situation wouldn't have improved at all.",YTA only slightly you clearly dumped a drunk chick on him b/c you didnt want to deal with her.,1,YTA,0.0,0.0,1
3947,"AITA for getting my dad's job offer rescinded? Sigh. I think I messed up.

My parents do not live in a very populated US city, they're around 60yo, and my dad's been laid off from his old job about half a year ago. He's been applying for jobs and finally got a written offer.

The offer is for the same amount that he's been getting for years: it's a decent amount but by no means very high.

I don't live with my parents and I work in a different industry, but having gone through several job offers and successful negotiations, I suggested that my dad asks for a +$5k raise. The reply email was crafted very carefully, stating that 1) he appreciates the offer and the initial meeting 2) he's wondering if there's any flexibility in the offer because he believes he can bring a lot to the team and the company and 3) finally asking if they're willing to go for +$5k.

Initially my dad hesitated (I think because he's been tired of searching for a job for so long), but eventually he agreed to try it. My thought process was:

1. He deserves more -- he really is amazing in his industry
2. It's an initial negotiation and he's not asking for an outrageous amount on top of the initial offer
3. He's never agreed to any previous offer from them (or discussed any potential salary), so there's no reason why he can't try to ask for a bit more
4. The email was extremely professional and polite, structured so they could easily have replied back with ""no, that's our best and final offer""

To my shock, the employer's contact called back (not emailed back) 3 days later saying they're rescinding the offer...(!)

Wat. The only reason I can think of is that they were so unsure of whether to hire him or not initially, that they either 1) decided not to bother or 2) found someone else.

Of course my dad feels horrible now, and so do I. And if it wasn't for my convincing, he would probably have that job by now.

Am I the asshole for getting involved and should we not have negotiated?

60+ year olds are much less daring then recent grads for reasons I won't even bother explaining to you. Im certain you beat him over the head with negotiating when everyone else here knows it's the least smart thing to do at his age.

So my (F25) ex (M25) had some relatively severe mental health problems that lead to him being committed into a psychiatric facility for a week last year due to him being unmedicated. He is currently off his medication again and it was effecting my mental health because I wasn't sure how volatile he is and what would set him off.

3964,"AITA for insisting on giving someone, who I thought was my friend, a gift? This situation happened roughly 7 months ago, but I recently discovered this subreddit, and I thought it would be interesting to go back and reassess if anybody is the asshole here. This is also a throwaway account because I’m paranoid. 

I was friends with this girl who I met in 2016. She was the lead actress in a high school musical I was stage managing. Long story short, by the end of the show’s run I told myself I was in love with her. I boldly asked her to go out with me, and I was denied. I was bummed, but I was still happy I mustered up the courage to ask her. I hadn’t done something like that in a while.

Fast forward to 2017, and we still kept in touch after the show ended. I remember hanging out with her and other mutual friends at a 4th of July celebration. This made me really happy because it was the first 4th of July I spent with friends instead of with my family. Saw her in 2 other musicals she was in in spring 2018, met up with her during prom weekend, and she even invited me to her 18th birthday in July. 

After that, our friendship just fell apart so suddenly. I tried to meet with her before she moved to college, but my plans fell through. Then, this exchange of messages happened in December (see the Imgur album here - https://imgur.com/gallery/M80ZaOL). I took these screenshots in a different time zone (originally EST) so everything is off by 6 hours.

Between when she leaves me on read and my next text, I consult 3 of my closest friends for opinions on my situation. All 3 know her, but not enough to call them their friend. The consensus was that they all found it strange how even though we were good friends, she still refused to see me and accept my gift (a sweater and a formal dress. She had no idea what the presents were beforehand.) 1 of them suggested that my friendship with this girl was affected by her choice to “start fresh” in college, letting go of past friends in favor of making new ones, which I understood could happen, and it’s nothing personal. With this in mind, I texted her what can be seen in screenshots 4-7.

Huge blow to my self-esteem, and I thought I was over it, but here we are. 

Some questions I had at the time (and I suppose still have):
- Was it rude for her not to accept my gifts considering what they stood for? She wasn’t the only one I bought gifts for, and the others were happy I thought about them during the holiday season. Mind you, this is also the first time I’ve actually bought gifts for people who weren’t in my family.
- Was it too much of me to bring up the “shadow blocking” incident? In the moment, I brought it up because I wanted to call her out on her shady behavior. Should I have kept that information to myself?

One of my friends had offered me a little apartment in the city center a while ago, but I declined as it was not big enough for both of us to move into, and we really wanted to move in together. We finally got a super nice apartment due to some strings one of my family members pulled.

We both were super excited to finally live together in a way we had been envisioning for a long time. A week or so after we moved in my friend met a guy online and they got together super quick (like 5 days after their first date). I am really happy for her and me and the bf get along really well and we do like each other. The only issue I have is, that basically from the very first date they ever had, my friend has been sleeping over at his apartment every single night. I get that you wanna see your SO as much as you can when you're freshly in love and I don't have a problem with her sleeping over there per se, but it is literally every single night. The one or two times she actually has slept in her room in our apartment have always been a blast and we had an amazing time together. She and her bf have slept over here together once or twice as well and we also had a really fun and nice time then too (I do like him as I said), but they  prefer to usually sleep at his place.

I don't mind sleeping alone a couple times a week, but being alone in the apartment every single night, right after we moved in is not what I have signed up for when we moved in here together.  I know that she technically does not own me anything as long as she pays rent, but I just can't help how I feel. Every time I mention the topic she really does give me the feeling of being jealous or not understanding of her situation. I don't want to come of as if I don't want her to spend time with him or anything like that, but I really can't help the way I feel rn, which is somewhat hurt and pissed off. Me and my friend really do have a strong and good friendship and maybe I can't see that I am being an asshole rn due to my own feelings. All I ask for her is to sleep over at our place at least once or twice a week.

3974,"UPDATE-AITA for kicking a girl off our airsoft team for not following our rules. Update is we had our meeting and I sincerely took feedback from r/AITA into meeting. I got permission from the moderators to update and I wanted to share what happened. 

Here is the original if you didn’t see it yesterday:

https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/apiwrd/aita_for_kicking_a_girl_off_my_airsoft_team/


Since people had things tonight we agreed to meet over lunch and all but 3 people agreed to show up, even among the people that quit outright. So including me 16. I got to the office where we had it and was so surprised to see Madison sitting there. So that made it 17 people. The guy who has been on the team the longest  basically said that in light of what happened Sunday, he would do the talking. This really annoyed me but i remembered how much bad feedback I got here and didn’t say anything. 

They started off by having Madison say her thing. I have to admit she was very rational and but she did start crying which made me really uncomfortable. But basically her point was she just moved her for grad school, she didn’t want to do the bar and club scene anymore and she said the loved all of us for never asking her out or making her feel uncomfortable and it was the first time she felt like she ever found a group of people, including her sorority, where people didn’t judge her for her looks. I was like sure, whatever you think but come on. Anyways she said she was really sorry for not keeping our standards and she was just trying to have fun and she is a girl and doing crazy things with her hair or wearing pink camo is just in her mind set. She asked me if I would please consider if I she could stay on the team. 

I was totally on the spot so I was just started out by saying that I was sorry and I overreacted. But then I said I think it’s best if I step down because it was obvious I take it too seriously and if 5 people quit in the spot, obviously it was time for a change. But as long as I was still doing it, I was happy to have her back. 

So that lifted a huge weight in the room. So we got into more business and it turns out that the reason Madison had not bought her competition gear is because she was reaching out to various companies using her “insta-fame” to get our team sponsored. She said the reason she didn’t tell me anything because these deals are very tenuous and she didn’t want to let us down if they fell through. So she’s still working on the uniform stuff but she did get an incredible deal to become a representative for an ammo company so starting with the tournament in March we will have absolutely free airsoft pellets, which for a team of 20 people who play mostly every weekend is huge. She is starting an airsoft specific Instagram and she expects it will take off and she’ll get deals for the team. I’m literally blown away by her generosity and I’m sure she’ll make some income from it, but she’s choosing to share with us after the way I treated her. 

But anyways so we talked about more team business and we decided that we would sort of split the leadership position in that we would have an adminstrator for day to day stuff and that’s going to be the guy who started the meeting but everyone was happy with how I managed the team for tournaments so I’ll be in charge of all tournament related business and conduct at tournaments.  We also agreed that we would dramatically loosen the uniform requirements for weekend local play and Madison (or anyone I guess) could wear her pink camo or do her hair in bright red pony tail puffs as long as she was being safe (no belly shirts) but tournaments we would still have our team unforms.

So that is where we are. Team is still together, we get a bunch of free stuff and maybe more on the way. Madison is cool but it was the first time a teammate hugged me after a meeting but I guess we have to adjust to hugging and crying at our meetings. It’s weird but i guess I can stand to update my world view. ","I guess this is the best outcome you could ask for but...

3976,"AITA for waiting for my girlfriend to text me, first? Before jumping to any conclusions, here’s the backstory and where I’m at:

We’ve been together for 4 great months. She’s a great girl and I’m so happy with her. But, one flaw: she never reaches out to me.

I call/text her everyday just saying hi and seeing how she’s doing. You know, “boyfriend”, type stuff. And it’s easy for me to do when I truly care for her. After 3+ months I started getting annoyed. Realized she has never called me ONCE. I repeat, NOT ONCE. I know she really cares for me and wants to talk to me, so it baffles my mind why she won’t reach out. So, I started waiting to text her - i went crazy. I felt this unspoken tension the whole day and i knew she was waiting to hear from me. She eventually texted me, late at night (midnight) just saying goodnight and she hopes everything is okay. I said goodnight and said everything was good. Come the next day, no message until late, again. I opened up and told her how I feel like I’m the one reaching out all the time and I get no initiation from her. I told her I just want to feel more, “wanted”, and a simple text/call during the day could do all that and more. When I told her all of this, she replied:

“Hey, sorry if I dont text/ call you enough. I’ve never been good with that stuff but I’m going to try and work on it 🙂 I appreciate you always making an effort to talk to me. It’s dumb but I always think “I’ll just let him call me when it’s convenient for him so I know I’m not bothering/interrupting him” I know I can always talk to you if theres an issue and trust me, I had every intention on talking to you about whatever was going on at some point today. I want you to know you can do the same with me!! Even though it was only 1 day it was so not like us not to speak so my mind was racing automatically thinking the worst (typical me) and so I made myself so upset/sick over the fact that something was possibly not right. Sorry if any of this sounds dramatic but its 100% the truth. I just care about you A LOT and I want you to know! With all that being said, no need to not talk to me until I talk you anymore, I get it now and will make more of an effort 🙂”

I felt great reading that. So relieved. But, 2 days have passed and she hasn’t reached out all day. Of course, I could reach out to her. The phone works both way, I know that! But, I want to see if she really meant what she said.

Side note: She’s a quiet girl. An absolute DIME, but very to herself. So much so that this girl is a 10/10 but I’m her FIRST boyfriend at 21 years old. Maybe she’s new to the whole relationship thing? But, still. She acknowledged it and said she’d change. But, seemingly hasn’t.

Am I the asshole for playing this petty game and not reaching out?

We’ve been living in their basement which is set up like a guest house with living room, bedrooms, kitchen, dining room, etc.

3981,"AITA For Wanting My D&D Player To Be Someone Else? So this conflict has been resolved amongst ourselves but it's been at the back of my mind about whether I was in the wrong, hopefully that doesnt break the sub's rules.

Im the DM (Dungeon Master) for a group of 5 players from my friend group. We recently finished the Lost Mines of Phandelver campaign after that sort of fizzled out and I decided to run them through Waterdeep Dragon Heist next.

The majority of my group, including myself, are relatively new to D&D and it consists of:

Myself, the DM- A D&D newbie whose DMed twice and played as a PC twice

R- Formerly a Goblin Bard, now a Tiefling Cleric in the new game

J- A Tiefling Bloodhunter who kept his character and we just rolled him back to Lv. 1

M- The only veteran of the group, played ~4 years, who used to be a Lizardfolk Barbarian but wanted to be a Tiefling Warlock

And two other party members who dont factor into this issue.

So J was already a Tiefling, as I mentioned the character was just carried over between campaigns, and then when we talk about trying out a new campaign R asks about trying out a different character because he's sick of being a squishy bard. He eventually comes up with the idea of a Tiefling Cleric.

Here's where we reach the AITA:
Like I said, M wants to be a Tiefling too. Straight off the bat I tell him 'I'd rather you not be a Tiefling as I dont want too many of one species' and I repeat this multiple times and each time he tells me no, he wants to stick with the Tiefling. Its not that I have a problem with Tieflings- having too many of any race is a problem for me. It'd be the same if I had a lot of Elves or Dragonborn, I'd want some people to switch. R and J were already Tieflings and they were Tieflings first so if anyone should change it should be M.

I feel like the a-hole here because I was essentially forcing him to play a different character. To me it seems obvious that M is in the wrong but I asked people both inside the group and out and while I got some support a fair few told me that I was being too harsh or that it shouldnt matter what species he played.

(M did eventually switch to an Aasimar Warlock but I wanted to ask a non-bias group about the situation because I didnt want to have been the a-hole over trivial things and its been bothering me that I couldve been.)

So pass your divine judgement, AITA?

(Edit: Fixed some formatting so there wasnt a brick of text in one part.)","YTA

First of all, your objection doesn't even make sense. Why would it be a problem to have too many of the same race? You never even bother to explain it, so I'm forced to assume you have no real reasons.

Second of all, you're trying to violate player agency in character creation (which is bad), and you're doing it arbitrarily (which is really bad). If he can't play tiefling, why can the other guy? Because he ""called it first""? He got dibs? That's not how any of this works.

Honestly, if I were considering playing in your game, and I even heard about you pulling something like this, I would drop immediately. This is way across the line of acceptable DM behavior.",1,YTA,0.0,0.0,0
3982,"AITA for saying “I identify as Indigenous first because it’s a ‘fuck you’”? Throwaway because reasons. Also going to change some details. 

This weekend I was at an event and my(23f) boyfriend(23m) and I got to talking to a friend’s dad. This friend’s dad recently adopted an indigenous little girl, while they are not indigenous. He was asking me for insight on how to include her culture in raising her, etc. We live in Canada, where indigenous people have not always been treated respectfully. 

We got to talking about identity because he wants her to have a connection to her heritage. We talked about land acknowledgements, truth and reconciliation. So I said “first and foremost, I identify as (insert indigenous group), because it’s a big ‘fuck you’”

Now, it wasn’t meant to be a “fuck you” to anyone in particular, just in general- the history. In the past, indigenous people were forced to assimilate and lost the culture. And I feel that by taking pride in my heritage, I’m “sticking it to the man,” for lack of better wording. 

Yesterday, my boyfriend said it was a very uncomfortable situation because he couldn’t understand what I meant. I’m also of European descent and so he thought it was strange that I identify as indigenous first. He thought it was insulting to my mother, who isn’t indigenous. 

I tried explaining that growing up without my biological father and in a mostly white neighbourhood, I was often ridiculed and bullied for being indigenous- I was called a squaw, dirty Indian, dirty. I was embarrassed for a long time of who I was. But by now taking pride in who I am, that’s the big “fuck you,” because I won’t allow my heritage to be erased. 

I’ve been with him for four years, and he was suddenly thinking that I hate the government, that I think I’m “owed.” He feels that I shouldn’t hang onto the negative past, and that it’s not healthy. I’ve never been that type of person and I work hard for what I want. Hell, I work in a government position. 

I’m not stuck in the past- I’m merely proud of who I am despite history’s role in trying to erase indigenous cultures. 

The first part of truth and reconciliation is truth- it’s not allowing the past to be forgotten. 

He’s still having trouble understanding why I would say it the way I did, but I see nothing wrong (except for maybe the cursing).

So reddit- AITA?",">We got to talking about identity because he wants her to have a connection to her heritage. We talked about land acknowledgements, truth and reconciliation. So I said “first and foremost, I identify as (insert indigenous group), **because it’s a big ‘fuck you’”**

3983,"AITA for shutting my sisters disruptive child in a bedroom for a few hours? My younger sister has been nagging me to take care of her child while she and her husband go out on date nights for a while now. I don't like children and I've always refused her but after being worn down by costant begging I gave in. Now I'm in this shitty situation.

To cut a long story short her son arrives and *immediately* starts causing shit. Running around the place, demanding to eat all my snacks, opening my things to look around for toys, and demanding attention constantly. I tell him to watch TV and just let me relax but he seems determined not to listen to a word I said. Finally I get him to calm down and sit after bribing him with ice cream I was saving for the weekend he shuts up and finally settles down. Or so I think.

I go back to my room to browse reddit and try to relax but after a while I hear my cat let out a giant yowl. I immediately run to investigate and find the little shit standing there with my cat backed into a corner, back raised and hissing. He immediately backs away when he sees me but I just know he's done some shit and after I question him and he breaks out crying and saying he just wanted to play a game with the cat. When I go to take him back to the lounge to sit down I see not only has he been harassing my cat, he's smeared ice cream all over my new **white** couch and on the carpet below. I should add in here he is a 7 year old not 3, there is no reason for him to make such a mess other than a basic lack of respect. 

At this point I am really angry, especially after seeing my poor baby in a state because of him, but trying to keep it cool. I tell him he's to clean the mess he made but then he starts to throw an almighty tantrum and start screaming and crying at the idea of having to face a consequence for the mess he has created. I've had it by now and I tell him he's going to sit in a room until he can calm down and behave and not terrorize my cat and cause giant messes in my house. I take him to the guest room and shut the door and say he can come out only when he starts acting properly. Spoiler alert, he cries the entire time which is honestly ridiculous and he's still there and sobbing when his lovely mother and her darling hubby arrive to pick him up.

They **FREAK** the fuck out at me and it ends up with them storming out. Now my mother and brother are blowing up my phone with a biased story straight out of my dear sisters mouth about how I shouted at and scared her son for no reason and locked him in a room. 

I know that (quite luckily) I'm not my nephews mother, and my sister seems to think that means I have no right to punish him.

3988,"AITA for supposedly being ungrateful? I’m a single mom with a 7 year old daughter. My sister doesn’t have any kids. She likes to take my daughter out for activities like movies, street festivals, ice skating, etc. They probably go out a few times a month. This is almost always on the weekends when I’m not at work so it’s not like child care for me, it’s a fun activity for the two of them that my sister volunteers to do. I had a rough divorce and my ex isn’t in the picture anymore. When the divorce was going on my daughter and I stayed with my sister for about 3 months when I couldn’t afford rent on my own. Since then I went back to school and my sister offered to cover my tuition for the first semester. I took her up on it since she has a good job and can afford it. I work as many hours as I can but it’s tough with school and my daughter and my ex works under the table so he doesn’t pay support. We get by but there aren’t a lot of extras.

My sister is good friends with one of my coworkers and he told me how lucky I am that my sister has done so much for me and my daughter. I told my coworker that my sister chooses to do these things so it’s nothing for her to brag about.

I live with my boyfriend (the father of the youngest and the one I'm pregnant with.) We are a very upper middle class family, we both work and have good paying jobs and have had a lot of financial luck. My best friend, Sarah (25f) lives in her fiance's (Scott, 32m) house. She doesn't work. They have no kids together. I know that he is at least mentally and verbally abusive towards her.

Roughly 2 weeks ago, I went dress shopping With Sarah, and she brought Scott. Everytime Sarah came on to the floor in a dress she liked (lace, really traditional looking but still beautiful) he would call it ugly. He would insult the dress, and her, and called her horrible names. In the end, she gave up and we left. The next day she sent me a picture of a shitty white prom dress that showed entirely too much skin (for her tastes) and told me that that was the dress he had picked for her to wear. And this isn't even the worst thing I've seen him do to her. 

Yesterday, she came to me in distress and basically broke down. She told me she wanted to leave Scott but she couldn't because she didn't let her work and I was the only friend she was ""allowed"" to have. She told me she had nowhere to go and no one to turn to, she didn't even have any money to stay at a motel for a night. So.. I offered a job to her. 

Like I said, me and my boyfriend both work, and for four kids, daycare costs are through the roof. So I offered to pay Sarah to care for my children. The deal we set out was that I would give her the money to get herself an apartment, and then she would watch our children during the day to pay that cost back as well as gain her own income. She would not live at our house, she would not eat our food, she wouldn't be invading on our lives. I didn't discuss this with my boyfriend (which is what could make me the asshole here). I also made sure she knew that this wasn't an immediate thing. She went home. The plan that I put together in my head also meant she would get paid a bit less than what we pay for daycare, but she still would earn plenty, and it wouldn't affect me and my boyfriend that much. 

When I mentioned this to my boyfriend after the kids had gone to bed last night, he blew up on me for even suggesting the idea to her. He said that she was ""untrustworthy"" and a ""bad influence on the children."" Sarah has watched my children before. Hell, she half raised the oldest three. I don't know why he lashed out like that. I just.. I'm kinda wondering if I reconsider my offer to Sarah, or what I should do overall. I also don't know if I'm an asshole or not, but my boyfriend's reaction is making feel like I am.
So.. AITA..?

My dad lives with my grandma because he has mental issues and struggles to fix his economy and he doesnt seek help either.

Right after they plan on going to a sleepover at their other friend’s house (a girl I don’t know) so if I don’t go to the carnival there is no way I’ll be able to see them basically on my last day (since the actual last day is busy with my family and packing). 

Even when I tell them on FaceTime calls that I don’t want to go, they tell me that they’ll go without me then. They’re not trying to be mean or rude, they just simply say that they’d want me there but if I really don’t want to come I don’t have to and they’ll go without me. 

So I guess what I’m trying to say with this post is that I’d kinda want them to not go to the carnival so that we could do some other fun activity together. I mean like I said, there will be another one the following day, and that day I won’t be able to hang out with them anyway. I feel like I’m being the bad guy here...

So Reddit, AITA?","YTA. You can’t just swoop in and expect everyone to rearrange their lives and change their plans for you. The world doesn’t revolve around you. If you really want to see your friends, you will do so in a way that is convenient for them too and doesn’t require them to miss out on an event they want to go to. You’re not that special.",1,YTA,0.0,0.0,0
3999,"AITA for letting my roommate fuck my friend’s recent ex? About a year ago my close friend, E, was dumped by his girlfriend, V. I was very close to him and his girlfriend was my girlfriend’s roommate at the time. Once she broke up with him, he asked me to keep a distant eye on her for a short period of time - they had been together for about 3 years so he felt there was a good chance of them getting back together, also he owned the majority of her furniture which he would take away if she screwed around within the first couple days. 

Within about one week of the breakup, she was over at my house for a tailgate for football season. She essentially spent the whole day with my roommate, he later took her home and banged her - they stayed consistent for several months following. 

As my friend E asked, I relayed the message to him the next day. I was clear that I valued his friendship more than that of my current roommate and helped him along the way with the breakup. We talked a few times a week and grabbed some drinks around the holidays when I was in town - everything seemed great as always. 

Soon after, his contact became very brief and then started completely avoiding me. I asked the reasoning behind it and got nothing in response. Found this weird since he is still in contact with his ex. 

Anyway, I’d love to hear some opinions. 
Thanks in advance. ","1. She is her own person, was no longer in a relationship and can have sex with whomever she wants to. 
2. You didn’t break ‘bro-code’ by having sex with her yourself.
3. Your friend asking you to ‘keep an eye on her’ after the breakup is ludicrous and controlling behavior. Why, because he wanted to be able to further punish her? This was a major asshole move on his part. 

Reasonably, how would you have been able to stop them from hooking up? 

So, here’s where you are an asshole: You didn’t ‘let’ your roommate do anything. He made a choice and she made a choice. Further, had you not ratted them out, maybe her ex could have moved on a little more decorum. It could also explain why he’s still talking to her (someone he had an intimate relationship with for three years) and not to you (guilt for making the request for you to spy on her and now always remembering how he felt when you told him). 

I understand your motives of wanting to be there for your friend, but it was very unfair of him to even ask that of you and you definitely shouldn’t have followed through with it. ",1,YTA,1.0,0.0,0
